[ORGANIZATION] Meeting 8/1,7,Glad to hear üëç,3
Please be on the look-out for my brother.,16,"Lot of methheads stay at the quality inn. Does he use? Not judging if he does, there‚Äôs a reason I know what kind of people frequent that location. Just saying, that may be why it‚Äôs hard to get ahold of him. If he still has a room there, he may just be holed up on a bender. If he‚Äôs made friends, he may be with them.",2
Please be on the look-out for my brother.,16,"I know of veterans resources here but if he is refusing them, not much can be done.",1
Please be on the look-out for my brother.,16,What is your contact information in case someone sees your brother?,1
Please be on the look-out for my brother.,16,What does he look like?,1
Please be on the look-out for my brother.,16,"He was dropped off there by a former co-worker. I honestly don't know if he's using. He used to be one of those guys that ate super healthy and worked out, one of those my-body-is-a-temple type of person. He is very shy, so I don't think he would make friends. But if he's using, drugs change people.¬†",1
Please be on the look-out for my brother.,16,"I'm hoping that since I'm also a vet, that he'll listen to me and I can convince him. I haven't seen him in [ORGANIZATION], and only recently spoke with him on the phone. Unfortunately, he went downhill mentally after leaving the [ORGANIZATION].",2
Please be on the look-out for my brother.,16,How long ago was he dropped off there?,1
Please be on the look-out for my brother.,16,How was he in the military if he is mentally ill?,1
Please be on the look-out for my brother.,16,"He was last there on [ORGANIZATION]; I had bought him [PERSON] once it got back to me that's where he was. I spoke with him briefly on the room phone, enough to let him know I paid for [PERSON]. It might have freaked him out that I knew where he was.",1
Please be on the look-out for my brother.,16,"There are plenty of people who are in the military and mentally ill. This was not something that he had before enlisting; his symptoms did not start to show until after he got out. He's had numerous concussions, so it's possible that has contributed.",2
Please be on the look-out for my brother.,16,"And you haven‚Äôt been able to reach him since? The quality in is like 5 mins away from me, I can go check on him [TIME] if you want me to.",2
Please be on the look-out for my brother.,16,"I tried calling him on his cell phone, but it goes straight to voicemail. I'm not sure if it's on or if he even still has it. I basically want to keep tabs on him until I go to [ORGANIZATION], with the hopes of finding him and convincing him to get help.",1
Please be on the look-out for my brother.,16,"Did you pay for accommodations until you get here? Without a phone, it‚Äôll be hard to track him. Have you called the hotel to see if he‚Äôs been there? Sorry for what he‚Äôs going through, I hope you get in touch with him. I know someone with schizophrenia, it‚Äôs scary when they go off their meds, because by the time they need help, they‚Äôre too sick to realize it or know how to get help. PERSON0 know if there is anything I can do to help. I‚Äôm not that far away from quality [PERSON], I can swing by there after work and ask the front desk if he‚Äôs there.",1
Please be on the look-out for my brother.,16,"Yes, I paid for [ORGANIZATION], but I couldn't afford to pay for [PERSON] worth. When I called [ORGANIZATION], they said they think he checked out. He doesn't have a car, so I'm hoping he stays in the area.",1
 [ORGANIZATION] on DATE0 Summary,12,Does the city provide a transcript of the meeting?,3
 [ORGANIZATION] on DATE0 Summary,12,What are everyone's thoughts on the FAC0? I don't want it. Taxes are high already and they keep on getting higher and higher. There's no self control at the moment with financial responsibility to the citizens.,1
 [ORGANIZATION] on DATE0 Summary,12,"Yes, it does. You have to go watch it on the city website instead.",1
 [ORGANIZATION] on DATE0 Summary,12,I agree. they should focus on fixing the roads and removing the lights by [ORGANIZATION] thatve been there for [ORGANIZATION] now. [ORGANIZATION] also needs to stop building so many poco locos esp giving that he gets a % for every poco loco,1
