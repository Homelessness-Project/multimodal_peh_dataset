Does he use? Not judging if he does, there‚Äôs a reason I know what kind of people frequent that location. Just saying, that may be why it‚Äôs hard to get ahold of him. If he still has a room there, he may just be holed up on a bender. If he‚Äôs made friends, he may be with them.",2,2024-07-11 09:45:30 UTC

I honestly don't know if he's using. He used to be one of those guys that ate super healthy and worked out, one of those my-body-is-a-temple type of person. He is very shy, so I don't think he would make friends. But if he's using, drugs change people.¬†",1,2024-07-11 13:05:46 UTC

Without a phone, it‚Äôll be hard to track him. Have you called the hotel to see if he‚Äôs been there? Sorry for what he‚Äôs going through, I hope you get in touch with him. I know someone with schizophrenia, it‚Äôs scary when they go off their meds, because by the time they need help, they‚Äôre too sick to realize it or know how to get help.
