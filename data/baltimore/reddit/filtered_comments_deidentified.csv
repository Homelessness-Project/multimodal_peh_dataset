I was doing some software work [TIME], so I decided to go to [ORGANIZATION] for a snack. [ORGANIZATION] asked if I had any extra cash so I gave him some money. He asked what I'm doing out there so late in my pajamas since everyone else there was dressed for going to the bars. I told him that I was doing software work, which is when he showed me his [PERSON] tattoo. I asked him what a [LOCATION] was doing on the streets, which is when he talked about his mental health issues. He seemed like a good guy that just struggled with his demons. He also seemed well liked by his homeless friends he introduced me to.

I'm so sorry for your loss. [ORGANIZATION] left a lasting impression on me during that brief encounter, and it‚Äôs clear he had a kind heart despite his struggles. I hope you can find comfort in knowing how he touched the lives of others, even in small, unexpected ways. Wishing you strength and peace during this difficult time."

I‚Äôd like to say I was always warm and open hearted about homeless people, but I wasn‚Äôt. For a longtime I felt angry at [ORGANIZATION], because we wanted so badly for him to make better choices, and every time I saw a homeless person I thought, ‚ÄúGet a job and go home and take care of your family‚Äù.  But time and age help us shift our perspectives and while I can‚Äôt intuitively understand why he made the decisions he made, I know he wanted, so badly, to do better. 

He faced some big challenges, and in [ORGANIZATION], getting a job must have been incredibly difficult. How do you get a job with no address, no ID, no recent work history, and no dental care?   It‚Äôs not impossible, but it‚Äôs hard, for sure.   I wish he had found the [STREET] out, and the [ORGANIZATION] community surely threw him a lifeline, but I can see how hard it would have been, just the same. With his mental health challenges, it obviously was more than he could manage.

And so with no work, we must rely upon the kindness of strangers.  At the end, and despite all of his struggles and the realities of his life, he still wanted to live.  Thank you for helping someone else to get by [LOCATION]."

\
... The city bought the hotels and the parking lot between them for $15.2 million, in a deal approved by ORG2 in [LOCATION]. Funds from the federal [ORGANIZATION] covered the cost
\
[ORGANIZATION] said [ORGANIZATION] that 378 families have stayed at the hotels so far. With capacity for 175 people, FAC0 is being used as flexible housing for families and couples, the city homelessness office said in a email [ORGANIZATION]. Rooms at ORG3 serve men with the capacity to provide emergency shelter to 120.
\Emergency shelters are designed to have lower barriers to entry and address more immediate needs than permanent housing.
\
... [ORGANIZATION] said the goal is to get to 800 shelter beds and convert the hotels into permanent supportive housing. She said the office expects to announce a call for permanent housing applicants in [LOCATION].

It‚Äôs a common misconception that homeless people are middle class folks who are down on their luck. In reality, many have severe, untreated mental health issues and drug addictions that perpetuates them being unhoused.

You see how annoying that is? 

Also, you didn't even respond to my hypothetical where you COULD be homeless from something out of your control, like a house fire. Even if you have emergency savings, you most likely wouldn't have enough to buy a new house immediately, let alone all new furniture and supplies. There is [ORGANIZATION] a risk of becoming homeless (and yes, that includes if you have to stay with friends or family) under capitalism.

On a more serious note, OP your life is a train wreck. A lot of this will be under your control, but it'll probably take time to fix it. The first step is going to be accepting that your life is a train wreck. The second step will be coming to the realization that you can do something about it. And third will be doing it and not looking back.

There's definitely a lot of resources/advice on this subreddit regarding homelessness. Use the search function, this is an unfortunately somewhat common ask/topic. There's certainly a range of options out there, including some that are open to women exclusively. I suggest spending some time reading those posts and following up with the advice and/or the people who posted. I guarantee that if you use the search and dig through old posts you'll find some sort of help - I just don't know what it will look like.

Notice how you keep having falling outs with people? Your step mom, the roommate, seems like a past landlord based upon your post history, and I'm sure there's more. Sometimes it's a sound strategic plan to make an effort to NOT piss people off, especially people you might need support from. Maybe the step mom is a horrible person who has [ORGANIZATION] tattooed on her forehead. Just let it slide and realize that having an amicable relationship with your father is going to be substantially higher value to you than getting into some stupid argument.

Look into something like nursing. I'm sure there are some low cost or free programs you could exercise to get into school for nursing. I know area CCs all have programs for nursing of some kind. You could always start somewhere like a nursing home (they're [ORGANIZATION] desperate for people) which isn't a fabulous work environment but it's better than this [ORGANIZATION] thing you've got going on. And it's something you could translate into higher pay [DATE] down the [STREET]. Dental hygienist might be a good option too.

Also, ditch the fiance. Immediately. He's never going to be a positive influence in your life and will drag you down with him. I don't know how your life will turn out but I can guarantee it will suck if you stick with him."

I saw him DATE1. he wasn't asleep. just laying there..
110,2024-05-01 01:06:09 UTC,2,2024-05-01 15:46:31 UTC,[PERSON],"That‚Äôs PERSON0. He‚Äôs the man. He won‚Äôt take anything from you. Has an alcohol problem, and probably some mental illness. He goes from homeless to sheltered a few times a year, but always ends up back. [PERSON] is very nice and never aggressive. Talks to everyone in the neighborhood, I used to bring him food from time to time or I would walk down to my house and heat up food that he had gotten from somewhere along the [STREET]. One of my favorite stories is [PERSON] gave him a bunch of free food and he walked up and down the [STREET] sharing it with all of the other homeless guys on the block. He‚Äôs pretty well taken care of though, my group of friends have given him shoes, blankets when it‚Äôs cold, jackets etc. mainly though he just wants someone to stop and chat with him for a few mins. 

It‚Äôs always nice to want to help someone, it makes you feel good, but be very cautious. When you are talking to homeless people you cannot relate‚Ä¶ your experiences are not theirs. Perhaps instead of asking an Internet forum how you can help, you engage in a conversation with him the next time you see him and ask him if he needs anything. He may not, he may not want your help or the things you ‚Äúthink‚Äù he needs may be offensive or off putting. In order to truly help someone you need to be selfless, do it because you want to help out your fellow man, not so you can post about it online or pat yourself on the back and say what a good job you did(not saying you‚Äôre doing this). Homeless people are no different than you or I, they are still human beings, albeit with very different circumstances. So instead of asking a bunch of people who go home to a house DATE1 what THEY would do, just go talk to him. As I said he‚Äôs an awesome guy unless you catch him blacked out in which case you can‚Äôt really follow what he‚Äôs saying."

If you or anyone else sees this that's a smoker I can tell you from personal experience as a beggar... If you have no cash offer the person a cig. 99% they will take it and be very grateful.

Edit: if you can afford it, another great thing to do is take all the extra plastic bags everyone has a ton of and put a bottle of water, a lil snack like granola bar, those lil disposable hand warmers you can get at the dollar store, possibly some gloves, mittens, hats, a travel toothbrush/toothpaste,  SOCKS are super useful, chapstick, sanitary products like hand sanitizer, tampons/pads, wet wipes, [ORGANIZATION] is a big one,even for people who arent addicts they all know one and I've saved multiple strangers lives with it (you can usually get it at fire departments,needle exchanges,and pharmacies for free). You can pre pack the bags and keep a couple in your car. It's a good [STREET] to get rid of the bags and the bags can actually be used to cover feet to keep them warmer and dry. Cash is the best thing but if you're morally opposed to that the baggie of useful goodies helps. You can also write a lil encouraging note and throw it in there, maybe with some useful numbers like homeless shelters and suicide hotlines (someone else posted some helpful ones in this thread). Just that little bit of showing you care helps tremendously when you're out there getting treated like less than human and feeling like no one gives a shit."

In fact most federal homelessness dollars coming into the city are going into housing subsidies and case management. The feds are typically quite reluctant to fund shelters which leaves local communities to pick up most of those costs. [ORGANIZATION] changed things with ORG1 dollars, but that's not going to last forever.

Vouchers are great for long-term resolution for homelessness, but they are not good at addressing short-term crises. They sound great politically, but people are always disappointed with the implementation. Housing choice vouchers use market-rate landlords and even with source-of-income nondiscrimination in [STREET], many people experiencing homelessness (especially those that are chronically homeless) have bad credit, extensive eviction history, drug addiction, criminal history, etc. making them undesirable tenants even with the guaranteed voucher income. This makes them targets for slumlords. Fortunately, most vouchers come with an inspection requirement... the downside is this significantly slows the process as people moving into these vouchers have to endure multiple inspections. On top of that, vouchers and most landlords will want you to have an ID, [PERSON], and a [ORGANIZATION]. Fun fact, if you happen to lose all three documents (very common for those that are homeless), how do you prove who you are in order to get them? There's a [STREET] to do it, but it's not fun and requires a lot of coordination... (hint you need to get them in a specific order) which is where case managers come in. The city and lots of nonprofits fund case managers to help folks get their vital documents and all of the other paperwork required to apply for these programs. 

This process definitely needs improvement, but even at it's most efficient, it takes time, money, and coordination. Plus, it can be really quick for some people and really slow for others depending on their needs. Also, the fact that vouchers are considered permanent government expenditures, means that funding needs to budget to anticipate the person residing in this housing for [ORGANIZATION] or even [LOCATION]. Right now there is a national push for a subsidy that expires, but many are afraid that this is just kicking the problem down the [STREET]. Plus, with people who are chronically homeless, most funders and landlords will want to see clients having access to a social worker while in their permanent housing units to make sure that they are able to stay stable. That adds more money to the budget for salaries. Is it less expensive than having someone in a shelter and constantly using the emergency room? Sure... in the long run... but in the long run isn't the timeframe politicians and the public are working on, especially in a pandemic when all eyes are on you. Multiply that by the number of people who needs this service and you'll see why housing first is actually a lot more complicated than just ""giving people housing."" The city can get around this problem by pre-purchasing larger apartment buildings and attaching the vouchers specifically to those units -- but this can also create equivalent public housing ""slums"" as people no longer have a choice in where to live. 

This is where emergency crisis response and permanent housing are not two equivalent solutions. You need both. Emergency shelter is designed to be the quick and dirty solution to keeping people from sleeping under a bridge. It is the emergency room, whereby housing vouchers are long-term rehabilitation. The problem is during a pandemic you have thousands of new patients... the public is going to care more about whether or not those folks are sleeping outside than if their long-term needs are being taken care of.  The city is getting more permanent housing with the CARES Act, but even the new money coming in is not nearly enough to give even a fraction of assistance to everyone who needs a permanent subsidy. Unfortunately, hotels are cheap, uncomplicated, and can deal with all people in need as a block instead of as individuals which, sadly, is how a lot of the public thinks of them.

They key is a multi-pronged approach. Permanent subsidy for people with the highest most intensive needs and seniors, temporary subsidies for those in the middle, and connecting people to friends and family and one-time cash assistance for those with the least intensive needs. Plus, it would be nice to have a [STREET] to get people in vouchers that no longer need them out and into market-rate housing... but that's a whole different story.

In the meantime, you still need to have a system in [STREET] for right now and to deal with the upcoming eviction crisis to provide people with a roof over the heads *immediately*. This is where a robust shelter system comes in. Unfortunately, you need to have the *exit* from homelessness be a well-oiled machine before you can start funneling money from your shelter system back into it... which sort of presents a [DATE] as a well-oiled machine takes a lot of money and a lot of maintenance. Anyway, homelessness is a *very* complex problem and there is no one-size-fits-all solution to solving it. It also needs the support of all other social systems too, education, criminal justice, [ORGANIZATION], and homelessness, disparities in one affect disparities in all."

But I don't think that's the point you are making, so let me give you the reasons why providing for people experiencing homelessness is a good investment for the city overall from both a humanitarian and an economic perspective.

1) People tend to view those that are homeless as in a permanent state of desperation and helplessness. This isn't true, you're seeing people at their lowest of low... access to drug treatment, stability, mental healthcare, and common decency can do a lot to to make someone a productive member of society. The endgame of most homeless systems is to get them stabilized and back into the community, it's just that some have a longer journey than others.

2) Homelessness will [ORGANIZATION] cost the city money. Living outside is not great for your health so people will quickly wrack up a massive bill in emergency room costs. Plus, these people will need to go somewhere, they're not just going to vanish off the face of the planet. So they'll erect tent cities and panhandle on [STREET] corners... not great for a city's image and economic activity. So the city will need more policing because if you're not providing shelter, you need to manage encampments. Closing down an encampment just means you're constantly moving it somewhere else, or spreading people out. It becomes a game of wack-a-mole. This isn't free... [PERSON] needs to clean up encampment areas and the police need to constantly be kicking people out of private property. Plus it disincentives economic activity in the area as people are hesitant to move, open businesses, and spend money in [PERSON] if there is extreme amounts of vagrancy. This directly affects working folks. If you think FAC0 [STREET] is bad, you should check out [LOCATION] where the problem has gone completely out of control. You can throw everyone in jail, but paying for incarceration is [STREET] more expensive than shelter. Not to mention the judicial costs and human rights conversations. When you get down to it, the city's actions are probably the cheapest [STREET] to deal with homelessness (besides financing more permanent housing, but I already described the pitfalls and complexities of that above).

3) I may be naive, but I think most citizens of [ORGANIZATION] genuinely care about the welfare of it's most vulnerable citizens. Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. These are our friends, neighbors, family, and fellow [PERSON]ans.

That said, I think you are right that better roads and public transportation help the housed and homeless alike and I do agree that greater investment in infrastructure is desperately needed. But it cannot be at the expense of homeless services. There is no escaping the cost of extreme poverty on a city, so you might as well do the humane thing and provide support. That said... is the hotel the most humane thing... absolutely not, but it is a piece in a multifaceted system. It's hard to justify expensive permanent housing when you can't even provide a basic roof over someone's head, and to reiterate, there just isn't enough shelter space (especially shelter space that allows for people to maintain social distancing).

There are other overinflated budgets that should draw your ire for disinvestment before you come after homelessness (***cough, cough, policing***) but that's a whole other story."

It's easier to help people in stable situations and it's easier for people in stable situations to change and to want to change.

I went to both a kinda poor school (lots of families on welfare, most kids got free or reduced price lunch) and also a kinda rich school (lotsa kids who lived in mansions, luxury cars etc) and the kids at the rich school were much bigger bullies than the ones at the poor school. 

And about trash, are you sure people throw trash all over the [STREET] when they actually have a [STREET] to throw it and it gets picked up? If the dumpster is full then lotsa people are gonna litter rather than letting it stay inside their apartment. I think also a big thing is how well places are taken care of. If a [STREET] isn't maintained and nothing gets fixed, tenants aren't going to care either, but if it's unkept most people will make more of an effort. [ORGANIZATION] obviously has a really bad track record of upkeep for public housing and I think poverty concentration isn't good, but everything else isn't enough either when of extremely low income people, there is only subsidized housing available for 30% of those households."

These are often called rapid-exits for people who recently became homeless. There is also eviction prevention for people at risk of becoming homeless that can keep them out of the shelter system altogether.  That can be in the form of security deposits, finding single room rentals, money for travel, and yes, connection to friends and family. 

Really, it is a holistic problem-solving approach that is based on trying to figure out what an individual's unique barriers are to housing and trying to solve them, rather than shoving people into one-size-fits all programmatic approach. So, let's say someone has an income, but no savings, maybe they can find a rental unit on their own and just need a security deposit. Maybe they have a sibling in [ORGANIZATION] who is willing to take them in and they just need money for a bus ticket. Maybe they need mediation with an estranged relative... Or maybe they're in a panic because everything is crashing down that they haven't taken the time to regroup and think about their options. Most providers will just say ""put your name on this waitlist for housing"" and be patient, rather than helping you problem-solve your unique situation. 

The goal is not that these folks will live with a family member permanently, but even [ORGANIZATION] with your sister is [ORGANIZATION] out of shelters and [LOCATION] to regroup and make a longer-term plan. Sometimes, yes, it's having someone sit you down and help you make an uncomfortable phone call. It probably won't work for most, but even if it works for 5% of the homeless population, the return on investment is huge.

It is part of acknowledging that there will never be enough money in a community to provide rental assistance for everyone, so identifying those who don't need it and finding creative solutions (even creative temporary solutions) to keep them out of the shelter system is really important. I'll acknowledge it is a new [STREET] of thinking about social support systems, but it is a trend that is catching on and a lot of cities are implementing rapid exits and prevention / diversion strategies successfully."

I think often suggestions on where to live are based on ignorance about the city as a whole and the fact that white people have been working hard to live in white spaces and presume white superiority for the whole history of our country. 

I do think NIMBYism is a huge issue and that the city needs to collectively share in the challenges of the city and that's it's not useful to relegate all treatment centers or shelters or service agencies to a few neighborhoods. I also think that's distinct from just the concept of purchasing hotels to convert to efficiencies for people experiencing homelessness."

Then when I actually got my job here and worked in some of the rougher areas it really opened my eyes as to how some people live.  

What truly annoys me is when people live in a bubble and then insist that everyone else either exists according to their bubble or they are somehow inferior to them. That mindset is ridiculous and creates barriers to various cultures getting to learn about one another. 

As far aa [ORGANIZATION] is concerned Im gonna be honest and say that I d ont certain things going on near my home.

While its messed up that they d ont have a [STREET] of their own to lay their head at [TIME] it doesn't mean I want to have to run the gauntlet just to get a meal either.  

When it comes to services for the homeless I do believe that those services need to be somewhere thats relatively central and minimizes the need to travel for whats needed as well.

For drug addicts they can be the same [STREET] until they can get off the drugs but this thing about letting people just roam the streets or nod off all wherever isn't going to work.  

Honestly, in this city are the shelters full?  If not then they need to be fully utilized before other means come about.  Again with them being cleaned regularly and made safe from thieves and all that but the problem is in the how to make that happen?

People that staff such facilities need to be paid after all and paid good money to deal with the challenges they would face in such a [STREET].

Im not sure what idealized utopian society your talking about. 
 Making an effort to reduce begging is certainly not going to rid us of the problem. There have always been and always will be beggars, their numbers fluctuate. One reason for the current increase is our severe opioid problem and these fine folks aren‚Äôt planning their next meal or getting some cash togeather for a cheap motel. These individuals are making money to score so they can get up and do the same exact thing [ORGANIZATION]. They come from all over the state when the dope is plentiful, cheap, and strong, and reducing their numbers is what I‚Äôm talking about. Some people haven‚Äôt come to the conclusion that they themselves are a contributing factor to the problem and helping them understand this could make a difference. We have no idea how much of a difference until we try, not trying dosent work, and here we are. 
 There are currently programs in [STREET] to feed and shelter the homeless but the junkies, [ORGANIZATION], are the main problem. Until we‚Äôre ready to have a real, adult conversation about slowing down the opioid issue, we could try an alternate route. [ORGANIZATION]‚Äôs post is about reducing the number of panhandlers, I‚Äôm not here to save the world. One thing I know to be tru, if you take crackers to the park sooner or later you‚Äôll wind up covered in bird shit.

First, 99% of the shelters & assistance places have (or refer to) case managers and social workers to provide that long-term assistance.  I don't know any [STREET] except churches that say ""here's a meal now leave.""  
   
Second, giving $5 to a homeless person will not help him get a doctor's appointment or a mailing address.  [ORGANIZATION] provides both of those things.  There are things that are nearly impossible to do with small cash gifts, such as put down a security deposit on an apartment.       
   
If you give $5 to a homeless person standing on FAC0, it's a [TIME] walk or [TIME] bus ride to the nearest real grocery store.  Instead, they are likely going to get food at FAC1 or a corner store, thus spending the money relatively ineffectively.  Even if they walk there, they are limited by inability to cook anything.  For $5, [ORGANIZATION] can feed 5 people real hot meals.  
  
Not to mention that same situation but applied to buying shoes and clothing downtown.  
    
Not to mention, every homeless person in [ORGANIZATION] knows these things and is getting their food/shelter/supplies from charities, so literally 100% of your cash donation is ""fun money"" to them: snack food, cigs, alcohol, etc.  Absolutely none of it will be used in any helpful manner.  You do literally nothing except perhaps upkeep an addiction with your donation."

It would be nice to get squeegee boys to the side of the [STREET]. But that wouldn't stop panhandlers.

I don't actually think it would be a good idea, but I think it would solve the pan-handing problem. maybe if the city simultaneously increased [INSTITUTION] beds, methadone clinics, and police patrols, we could transition away from begging without the negative consequences. however, that requires tax dollars, and nobody wants their taxes to go up. so, here we sit with no solutions."

If you want to help deal with the structural issues that lead to homelessness then do that on a systemic level. Advocate for increased spending on mental health, [ORGANIZATION], addiction resources.

Those are often used as coping mechanisms to deal with the harshness of homelessness.

I can tell you, after [ORGANIZATION] of having worked with the homeless, that you don't have to give money, but if you want to do something, give attention.  People need friends, they need attention, they need respect.  

I never give money, because money is the one thing that does not help, but I volunteered for [ORGANIZATION] at soup kitchens and shelters, and helped people find services they needed.  Also, rather than donate to services, best to volunteer your time."

If you want to get involved, work for an organization that provides homeless services.  Otherwise, give them some cash- not every homeless person is an addict by any means.  Homeless people need money for all the same things you do- for medical care, food, shelter, transportation, etc.- they still have a regular life, just don't have the luxury of doing these things out of public view.  Even if they are struggling with addiction- an addict's need for drugs is just as real and urgent as your need for food- best thing you can do is give them some cash and trust them to use it to address whatever immediate short term need they have.  Life outdoors is harsh- using drugs or alcohol to make it slightly more bearable is a perfectly understandable coping mechanism. What do you use to cope with your life?  Don't judge what individuals need to do to get through a day of their life; give to those who ask and move on."

The worst case scenario is you keep them from needing to do something illegal and or dangerous to get that next high. Giving to charities that help the homeless is good too.    


If you won't give money you could keep granola bars, hand warmers, socks  or the like in your bag to give out instead."

3,2021-10-03 14:56:15 UTC,1,2021-10-14 17:09:40 UTC,What‚Äôs the best response to homeless beggars?,"We live right by the aquarium and there are two homeless guys who have been phenomenal. They panhandle, but they are respectful, helpful, quiet, they clean up their area. It's really a dream.

When we go out to eat, we make sure to bring something back for them.

We're going to be leaving the area soon, so I told one of them that we wanted to put together a package with stuff for them before we leave and I asked what would be most helpful.

His response... keeping in mind, we're in [ORGANIZATION] and [LOCATION] is coming up, so needs will change with the seasons:

* any kind of clothes, especially warm socks (READ MY NOTE DOWN BELOW)

* blankets

* warm jackets

* hygiene products (soap, shampoo, toothpaste, etc)

* he mentioned he had a girlfriend, and that feminine hygiene products would be particularly useful for her

**IMPORTANT:** A note on warm socks. I used to run an outdoor fitness group, so staying warm outdoors in [LOCATION] was super important to me and I did a bunch of research.

When looking for warm socks, most people select something by feel: Something that feels thick and fuzzy.

This is a mistake.

A lot of those (a majority, I would say) are made of cotton, which is horrible for warmth, because it retains moisture and saps heat from the wearer.

For warm socks, the best thing is natural wool. I know that's expensive, about $10 - $12 per pair at a [STREET] like [ORGANIZATION] or ORG1.

So the next best alternative is a synthetic like acrylic, polyester or nylon.

These type of socks are commonly sold under brand names like [ORGANIZATION]. They are both thick and warm. The only downside is that they stink to high heaven after a wearing, whereas wool won't.

I know it's going to feel really silly to be in the sock aisle and have to look at every single sock and find the label that indicates the type of material and then start comparing one with 65% acrylic, 30% polyester and 5% nylon against another with some other distribution, but if you actually care, take the time to do it.

&nbsp;

**In summary:**

**Cotton socks are a big waste of money for people who need to stay warm outdoors. Get wool (expensive) or synthetic (cheaper) only.**

Food pantries are not necessarily tied to specific locations (although many operated from churches or other charitable foundations may be) and they can be set up anywhere. Homeless shelters can be sponsored and more easily set up in cheaper areas of the city. 

Furthermore, in my experience, most homeless and underserved people do not apply for economic assistance or similar programs such as [ORGANIZATION] at the city or state office. It is often done with the assistance of social workers through a third-party at their location. Granted my experience with this kind of stuff was mainly in [ORGANIZATION], but from what I understand most of these resources operate similarly here.

Not very much space, but lightyears ahead of living on the [STREET]. The above room would be illegal to rent out in [ORGANIZATION] and in most American cities as far as I know.

2. End the federal reserve. Asset prices(including housing) are bid [STREET] [STREET] up to due to a [ORGANIZATION] period of 0% interest rates. Letting interest rates rising to the natural rate of interest will cause housing prices to fall and affordability to increase. "
31,2017-08-24 11:47:56 UTC,2,2017-08-24 16:58:47 UTC,[ORGANIZATION] officials to move homeless at '[LOCATION] to shelter,"I would think it's interesting to consider a solution where homeless are grouped up by why they're homeless. All veterans suffering from severe [DATE], for example, could be housed in the same area for easier treatment and, hopefully, support. Obviously people aren't always going to fit into neat little descriptions of why they are homeless but I think you can group them into people who are facing similar problems. Then if you need to do [DATE] counseling you can have someone go to a single location and potentially treat a lot more people. I'm not sure a one size fits all community is as effective since there are going to be a LARGE number of mental issues facing the homeless.

Let's retrofit existing rowhomes to meet the needs of those who would live there. This could vary wildly using the aforementioned strategy. Once again, I'm not sure a one size fits all strategy will work and would defer that to people who know better. But it's very plausible that certain home designs/layouts could help mitigate certain issues.

Also, I think intermingling ""low risk"" people in mixed income areas could be effective. Basically graduating them out of the aforementioned into something more normal with the idea being to eventually get them independent again and out of the system entirely."

41,2015-05-08 13:55:15 UTC,8,2015-05-08 21:24:48 UTC,Homeless people at my house,"Go out and confront them yourself. Homeless people are scared shitless of upstanding homeowners/renters simply because they know that it only takes one call from one of you to the police to have them arrested and then brought up on any outstanding warrants. More often than not, homeless folks are arrested and charged with misdemeanors but never show up for their trial date. As a result, depending on the crime, a bench warrant can be issued. In my experience, a direct confrontation works out in the long run because it keeps you from having to testify about something stupid they might have done on your property like petty vandalism or lewd and lascivious behavior. 

I think most other folks on this subreddit will disagree with my thoughts on this but frankly after having dealt with an inordinate number of the homeless while living in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], and now [ORGANIZATION], I can assure you that it is much simpler to handle things yourself unless you believe you truly need law enforcement to do it. More often than not, homeless people are actually incredibly understanding because they don't want to piss off the people who look the other [STREET] when they're staying somewhere illegally.

Additionally, if you feel unsafe in your home or believe that they may be using narcotics in your alley, I would advise you to purchase a shotgun. While this may sound extreme, when you have a community of drug using individuals using an area as a safe haven, that area can become the site of home invasions, burglaries, and car break-ins. In scenarios like this, you are within your rights to use your weapon as a standoff measure. Once you squeeze the trigger, things change legally but it's more likely that you'll never need to pick the gun up at all.


*edit* Let me be clear, a shotgun can be used as a standoff measure within the boundaries of your own property, not on the sidewalk or anywhere beyond your official property lines. At that point you are not within your rights, in [PERSON], to carry a weapon in public."

bonus points if it's a white person giving food to a non-white person. i have first-hand witnessed white kids complain when charity food is refused by people of color. when i was volunteering, i tried to make it a point to eat the food we were serving to show that it wasn't fucked with."

Do not touch them or yell at them. Go through the police and your landlord. The police will probably have to come out several times before the situation improves, and you may need to nag to get them to come out for something like this, but they will if you keep bugging them/reporting it. Your goal should be to get the police to do more than a verbal warning, like formally trespassing them off the property. The homeless are used to not being welcome, and they have nothing to loose (and may have mental health or addiction issues), so agression will probably backfire. You can also talk to your [LOCATION] about installing some features that make loitering uncomfortable/inconvenient/unattractive, like posted signs, video cameras, or even some strategically placed metal bars that occupy the areas they sleep in (like those benches in public areas with arm rests in the middle that stop you from laying down)"

It makes non-homeless people feel gross inside - gross because we can't do much about it in the grand scheme of things (volunteering at a soup kitchen doesn't put 10,000 people to work and provide affordable, non-slum housing) and gross because we don't really, truly want to be around it - it's uncouth to say but it's reality.

I'm not going to lie, homeless people make me feel unsafe. Yes, there are thousands of homeless people in [ORGANIZATION] and many of them are in the boat I was in about [ORGANIZATION] - a job loss, a car breaks down, bills overwhelm, and boom you're on the [STREET]. I've been there, literally. But there are those like the guy I see very frequently that stands and screams at women passing by. Screams, full on top of his lungs, horrible obscenities. He's absolutely mentally ill, there's no question about it. But knowing that doesn't make me any less afraid that he's going to end up in jail for raping or murdering someone.

I wish there was a solution. But it's a pipe dream to think that any of the standard platitudes about solving homelessness (volunteer, elect different city officials, speak out to the city council, etc etc) are either doable in a realistic manner or that I'm personally going to be impactful on them. In the meantime, I feel like a monster for hoping I don't have to see or interact with them. I feel like a monster because I was there and I pulled myself out of the pit and I can't do anything to help them (or more honestly, probably won't do anything) and what does that say about me."

Those with homes feel uncomfortable about having the homeless around, but since they can't do much about the ""homeless"" they do something about the ""around.""

Removing the homeless from a given area increases the public safety and value of that community. That increases incoming residents which brings jobs and raises property values.

More jobs and more property value means higher tax revenue for the community, some of which hopefully goes to help the ""homeless"" part of that statement.

I don't want anyone to be relegated to a tent city, but if there was a [STREET] to reduce the negative impact of homelessness on the people who aren't homeless (which, again, is an uncomfortable thing to want) that could hopefully create a ""rising tide lifts all boats"" scenario where the homeless are ultimately helped.

The visible homeless clearly aren't interested in shelters.

That said, your point is valid that politics will always [STREET] the cost higher than it probably needs to be as our leaders miss the forest through the trees.  

I have to echo the other comments though, that the responsibility has put on more than just the city.  Many homeless originate outside of the city and come into the city for access to services, high traffic of people to donate, and frankly, they get chased out of more affluent areas.

He actually didn't start the problem but he made it significantly worse. I wrote about this in my graduate capstone project:

&#x200B;

""While the [PERSON] administration‚Äòs massive cut-back  of  funding  to  community  and  housing  programs  is  often  identified  as  a  primary  catalyst  of  the  contemporary  era  of  urban  homelessness,  the  period  actually  began  some  time  earlier.  In  [ORGANIZATION]‚Äôs  and  [LOCATION],  psychiatrists  encouraged  policies  that  closed  state  mental  hospitals  because  many patients could now be treated with new medications  from  community  health  centers.  While  former  patients  initially  could  rely  on  receiving  treatments  from  these  centers  at  first,  funding  for  them  from  the  federal  government  lasted  DATE2  [DATE].    Without  federal  support,  states  could  not  fund  these  centers  which  were  vital  to  the  health  of  their  patients.  Many  discharged  patients  were  not  prepared  for  life  without  full-time  supervision  and  could  not  effectively  take  care  of  themselves.  Drugs alone could not effectively treat mental  health  issues,  which  caused  many  former  state hospital patients to become homeless (PERSON2 DATE3). While the [PERSON] administration didn‚Äôt start the contemporary homelessness problem, it drastically contributed to it by passing legislation that made it worse. The administration passed a law that that ended  involuntary  hospitalization  yet  discarded  a  proposed  law  that  would  have  resumed  funding  for  community  health  centers,  releasing  people  without giving them access to the care they need to function normally in society (PERSON3 DATE4). [ORGANIZATION] also decreased funding to [PERSON] (ORG2) for low income housing, meaning that cities could not afford  to  maintain  or  expand  their  public  housing  for low income individuals and families. These decisions in [ORGANIZATION] contributed to the rationale for a change in policy that ultimately led to the demolition of public housing in [ORGANIZATION], leaving some former residents homeless (PERSON4 DATE7).

You know what cities have a lot of? Parking garages. You know what cities need? Affordable housing.

One creative [STREET] to prop up [ORGANIZATION] is to turn those parking spaces into residential addresses. 

How? Take a standard shipping container and turn it into a studio. A bed, a desk, a microwave, an electric stove and oven, a toilet, a sink, some cabinets. Then drop it into a parking space. It is all run off of solar power or as much as can be. 

Rent may be affordable enough for homeless to have a [STREET]. May also be good transitional housing. Attract those [ORGANIZATION] by showing how minimalism it is. Pitch a TV show to [ORGANIZATION] to garner interest."

For a variety of good reasons, many homeless can be very weary or hostile of strangers showing up to their campsites. They are a very vulnerable population and are routinely taken advantage of and so will be very weary and territorially defensive sometimes about their camps. In short, they don't like strangers walking up on them where they feel most comfortable. If you have no prior level of trust built up with them or know someone who does, please I urge you out of respect for them to try to work through an organization that does rather than just showing up at a camp."

So there's that.  

But even for the vacants that are defined by simply being vacant,  there's the question of who owns them now. The article talks about community land trusts,  but doesn't really touch on how a [ORGANIZATION] would acquire the properties.  Would they be expropriated?  Bought out from the current owner? I'm willing to bet that the city's options are limited to knowing down condemned building or putting a line on the properties for property taxes owed.  

Once they are acquired,  who's going to pay to fix them up to a livable state? Who's going to define what a livable state looks like from unit to unit? 

Or are we just talking about squatting? I'd hazard a guess that many people are already just doing this,  but that comes with it's own liabilities for the city to deal with.   

The housing first model has shown a lot of success in reducing homeless (though not nessisaraly on reducing poverty)  but it doesn't involve putting people into substandard housing (at least not on paper, that's a whole other topic).  It involves investing in governments low income housing while also working to move people into affordable market units and providing wrap-around support once they've moved in to stabilize people in their units.  It's not as simple as moving the homeless into vacants.

I'm talking pry off the plywood door and have a view of the third floor. A homeless person would fair better in the streets than they would among the moldy water damage and rusty nails. Not to mention the walls that might cave in. 

In order to make these homes livable, by current standards, it would require total rehab. Construction costs about $85 to $135 per square foot so a very small row house (say 600 square feet) would cost *minimally* $51k. It would be more cost effective to knock down one city block and and create a building for the homeless people.

These homes will likely stay this [STREET] until torn down as the city tried to give the properties away ([ORGANIZATION] properties) and still not many takers. Most of people can't afford the rehab. The people who can afford to rehab don't want live there. 

City areas turn around one of two ways. They get torn down and rebuilt as commercial areas/high-rise apartments, or an investor comes around and rebuilds/rehabs an entire block, usually building off the edge of an okay area. But with little hope of a better job market, not may are willing to invest [ORGANIZATION].

Edit: Even if they could give these homes away (which would be nice because it would suck to see these beautiful old homes torn down) there is still the pesky matter of ground rent.

And honestly, I'm not sure what to immediate steps could be taken to solve this problem.

Despite the considerable efforts taken by the tribe to get them to stay at home they wouldn't do it and a few times a year we'd find one of them dead in the outskirts of town from a variety of causes. It was heartbreaking but there wasn't much we could do when they literally had a house of their own and a free check from the tribe every month and they still wouldn't sleep at home. I'm not sure what more you could do to help them beyond that. Mental health services (along with all health care) were free for them and they rarely used it.

Housing first is a solution to homelessness but it costs a lot of money up front so when you look at the math of $368/day per person that number will go down over time. Once we have facilities and housing people can move in and get jobs and move to their own places.

ORG1 puts all these providers in a single building, or makes it much easier to access them than it would be otherwise. The building is centrally located and easy to access.

I was legitimatly asking if the squeegee issue was one of the biggest problems in [ORGANIZATION], since people are so passionate about it despite seeming somewhat less important compared to other issues. Issues, which I might add, are connected to the squeegee problem (like poor school quality, lack of economic opportunities in many communities, other social services or lack there of, etc.). All I got was downvoted, so I'm still confused as to whether it is a major issue to be tackled or not. 

I don't think shes done ""absolutely nothing"". I think what she has done is really underwhelming. Though, her efforts towards homelessness seem pretty good, from what I understand (I won't pretend to know much about this, either).

One issue is that I don't think mayors have much control over crime. The mayor can hire and fire the commissioner, but not much else, since its a state agency. And consider that crime decreases in [ORGANIZATION] and [LOCATION] have been attributed to declines in unwanted pregnancies from [ORGANIZATION] and other circumstances beyond mayoral or police control.

""But other policing tactics appeared to have little impact, even in [LOCATION], which led the innovative wave in DATE3‚Äô90s.

But scholars are quick to note the trend actually began in DATE5""

I think its human nature to [STREET] blame. But the mayor I don't think is responsible for crime waves, and has little control in stopping it. 

I agree the squeegee program is not something to write home about, but is there really anything else to be done about them? It would be silly to arrest them. Not sure what other alternatives there are.

TLDR; Im not sure if the squeegee problem is a huge deal. Is it? (legit question). I dont think a mayor has as much control over broader issues than we think a mayor does. "

It's an easy cop out to just demonize the poor and say they're all con-men trying to game the welfare system for drugs. I'm not saying that doesn't happen, it does, but not nearly as much as you'd think. To just write the homeless off as lazy bastards that just want to milk government assistance is what people do when they themselves are too lazy to analyze the problem and think critically to understand root causes. In addition, that misunderstanding wont prompt the response necessary to help people, it just leads to the conclusion that we should jail the homeless, which doesn't help the individual and costs taxpayers much much more than leaving them on the [STREET]. No one wins in that scenario.  

Nobody want to be homeless, especially not in this town. [20 to 25% of the homeless population in [ORGANIZATION] suffers from some form of severe mental [ORGANIZATION]/factsheets/Mental_Illness.pdf) It's importatnt to diferentiate chronic homelessness from acute homelessness (everyone gets down on their luck once in a while, but most of us have the abiltiy to take measures to fix our situation 
That is part of the reason that you may [see the same people over and over again]([URL] even if they're jailed, they still don't have the tools or capabilities to repair their situation once the are released. 

Data from research conducted in [ORGANIZATION] indicates that:

‚Ä¢ About 30% of people who are chronically homeless have mental health conditions.

‚Ä¢ About 50% have co-occurring substance use problems.
According to analyses of data from the DATE1 NSHAPCxiv:

‚Ä¢ Over 60% of people who are chronically homelessness have experienced lifetime mental
health problems

‚Ä¢ Over 80% have experienced lifetime alcohol and/or drug problems

It's no coincidence that the homeless population skyrocketed around the same time that [ORGANIZATION] started shutting down the residential treatment facilities for mental illness. There was a similar spike around the time PERSON1 and other neuroleptics were developed -- you don't need to house a schizophrenic if there's a pill that can reduce/eliminate their hallucinations and delusions. Never mind the remaining cognitive impairment and thought disturbance! Just get them back out on the [STREET] so we can shut down this costly mental health facility and replace it with a medication distribution center. 

A friend of mine who had a psychotic break (not schizophrenia, but similar psychotic symptoms) told me that it was like suddenly walking into a world that was infinitely more complex and confusing than the one he used to occupy. He said it was like a transition from a simple, monastic life to a dystopian culture full of hierarchies and procedures [ORGANIZATION] which he had only the dimmest familiarity. We took care of him through that time, but it was hard. He just didn't understand basic stuff. I made a beef stew with biscuits on top of it [TIME], and I served him a plate full of it, and he just mushed it up into a big mess and said he didn't know how to eat it. I had to serve a new plate and separate the beef from the potatoes from the biscuits and so on, and then he ate each component separately. I served the same meal to him when he wasn't psychotic anymore, and he had no problem at all. 

I guess the point is that mental illness can really disrupt your functioning and make anything but the simplest of transactions and interactions completely mystifying. Hence, panhandling and then walking into a [ORGANIZATION] is something people with psychosis can manage. Going to a shelter is confusing -- they have to talk to a bunch of people, often including a mental health specialist. People with psychotic disorders (and people in general, really) can have some really paranoid ideas about mental health workers. 

It's not as simple as just perceiving and understanding the world as a person who isn't homeless perceives it. The world is very different for a homeless person -- sometimes because they're mentally ill, and sometimes just because they're homeless."

* Back on my feet [ORGANIZATION]. If you guys are athletic - or want to be - Back on my feet helps homeless people change their lives by training them to run. Volunteers run with them to show them that we care. Also, endorphins do everyone good. My sister and I volunteer and I can't recall any age requirements: [URL]

* ORG0: [ORGANIZATION] is a [STREET] where homeless people can go for a hot meal, training programs, and other resources such as shelters. This [STREET] is operated by ORG2 so if they don't take minor volunteers, they'd definitely know who does: [URL]

* Helping Up Mission: [URL]

14,2015-07-13 13:47:17 UTC,5,2015-07-13 16:49:40 UTC,Hands-On Volunteering With Homeless For Kids,"My opinion:

Taking kids down to a soup kitchen isn't going to change their behavior.  Parenting is  24/7 job.  Your children's behavior is a direct result of the behavior you exhibit around them, to them.  

Perhaps you should reflect on how you go about solving parenting issues, how you talk to your children, how you talk to your spouse, how you treat others and see if there are some things that you're unknowingly instilling in them?  Do you make frivolous purchases?  Do you waste food?  Have you taught them to be polite and vocally thank you for things?  **Do you have them do chores?**  The best [STREET] to instill the value of money to kids is to have them work for the things they get, imo.  And if they don't want to work/help around the house, then they don't get anything, possibly punished.  Its not a hard concept, but it is hard to enforce.  

Far too often it seems people are just looking for a [STREET] to feel good about themselves ^(like the vocal cause-of-DATE0 downtowners on this sub)  rather than actually make a difference.  Sometimes it does more harm than it does good (extreme liberalism)."

They work with other organizations so they can refer their clients to drug rehab organizations, workforce development, and more.  I personally know people who work there.  They're so passionate and they always try to do more to help their clients even if it's not related to healthcare."

They also said that many of the people that are chronically homeless, want to live on the [STREET]. Some people have mental illness or drug problems where they feel more comfortable in a tent city under 83 than they would in an apartment.

But one of the biggest things they mentioned was that people get used to begging at intersections instead of using resources that [ORGANIZATION] can connect them with, so they just keep doing what they are doing.

First, it is important to remember that each kid is different and there cookie cutter approaches usually do not work without some individualization of services.

[PERSON] children in a foster home have a support system which some choose to utilize and others do not.  This includes foster families (I will be the first to admit there are shitty ones but there are some really good ones).  [ORGANIZATION], which think about them what you will, but they provide many services to youth such as medical insurance, grants, funding, free college education until they are [LOCATION], a free laptop, and many other things that you just have to seek out.  They provide job training courses, seminars, [DATE] employment through [ORGANIZATION] and services such as rental assistance and furniture.  They also provide an independent living program which youth can choose to enter where most of their rent is paid, they just need to either be a full time student, have full time employment, or be part time in each.  They must abide by rules such as no drug use, illegal activities, and [TIME] visitors are sometimes restricted depending on the organization.

Still there is a HUGE number of youth in [ORGANIZATION] who age out and have no one and nothing and end up being homeless.  It is sad.  People (including many friends of mine) are actively trying to fix it.  One of the biggest hindrances imo is the attitude of youth that they do not need assistance, which leads to not seeking out help, which leads to them freaking out DATE2 before they turn [LOCATION] because they finally realize that all of these services disappear.  

Social workers actively try to engage youth in various services and programs, but are unsuccessful due to lack of cooperation from the youth, their foster families, or both.  I just wanted to provide a little bit of insight. "

Unless it‚Äôs the [ORGANIZATION] or ORG1 and has the capacity to really bring in top notch stuff fairly regularly, it‚Äôs not gonna be a good investment. The issue with downtown imo has more to do with the homeless crisis than tourist crap. Agreed downtown could use a classiness upgrade, but a museum isn‚Äôt how you fix it. People avoid downtown because of the crime and homeless people panhandling, I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll panhandle somewhere else cuz there‚Äôs a museum. Realistically we solve the problem by creating more shelters, increasing drug treatment centers, etc. We also should have community people pointing them to those shelters- I‚Äôve bought food for homeless people and so many of them don‚Äôt even know where shelters are cuz they don‚Äôt have a phone to google it with. 

I‚Äôm not proposing turning ORG2 into some mall- I‚Äôm strongly against the idea. But what downtown needs is something that actually brings people down there, stuff like local food and a movie theater are both good options. I‚Äôm proposing more of a park space with local food. It absolutely shouldn‚Äôt be retail stores and I fully agree on that. We have parks downtown, like the Holocaust memorial park. The issue with it is that it‚Äôs where all the addicts and homeless go, which makes people avoid the area. So just putting empty space there would yield the same result. Totally agree we should have some open space by the water, that‚Äôs the whole point, but gutting the space completely would realistically be a bad idea."

Unfortunately, if asking them nicely to go away doesn't work, you're either going to have to make the foyer so unpleasant that they don't want to hang out there or you're going to have to use force to get them to leave. If you don't want to get the police involved, and you're not willing to be a vigilante (which I strongly suggest you don't), your options are limited to the former. I'm not sure what your neighbors might agree to, but noise, bright lights, or unpleasant smells might work. 

In my opinion, this is a situation where you don't want to play nice. You have a trespasser on your hands. This is a major safety hazard for you and your fellow tenants. What if they have a medical emergency in your foyer? What if they decide to get belligerent with you when you come home or leave? What if they attack you?

But one thing I do know - throwing money at a problem one [STREET] or another, isn't going to solve any problems, individually or as a whole. And this is why I don't give them money. I *will* donate to orgs that are reliably addressing the issue, though.

I don't know the stats on whether withdrawl or near-OD is the impetus by which an addict will seek help, but as someone who lost a close family member to opioid addiction, you can't always save them. A lot of the comments on this thread are extremely heartfelt, empathetic, and progressive, and I truly believe everyone who feels strongly about harm reduction is genuine, but it still won't prevent the violence and the misery. And that includes for the larger community as well who have to deal with aggressive panhandlers along with vials and needles in their parks."

I was homeless in [ORGANIZATION].  I was homeless for [ORGANIZATION] before I got into a program with communal housing.  Then DATE1 through transition programs, school, and now I'm a success story.

There is so much waste and abuse, it's appalling. 

_____________________


DATE2 in [ORGANIZATION], there's at least 5 or 6 options for free food, for every meal.  If you don't want to sleep outside, there are plenty of shelters (emergency, or semi-permanent).  If you time it right, you can hit a food pantry twice a week from a majority of [ORGANIZATION] zip codes, keeping a fully stocked pantry.  

There is no real need.  Or, I should say, there is no unmet need.

Panhandlers and squeegee people ask for money, because people give them money.

We have an abundance of free resources, but people want more hand outs."

So it's not exactly possible to eliminate completely.

In addition, while poorer people who panhandle or resort to tactics like squeegeeing can often be helped by increasing access to education and opportunity, so many homeless people and panhandlers are mentally ill (which is also what causes them to act out and harass pedestrians).

Unless you address ALL issues, which are a) economic mobility, b) making sure there are healthier things kids can do to earn money than hustling strangers, and c) increasing mental healthcare access, any ""solution"" to homelessness and panhandling won't stick."

Having a society that prioritizes being able to keep homeless people, homeless and happy, is not good for society.  

There is no incentive to not be a drug addicted, begging, homeless person.   You think that maintaining a permanent homeless class of citizens is good for society?  

Get the fuck off the streets, into a job, and being a self-sustaining citizen should be the priority.

The homeless can get food stamps ($200/month) and there are a TON of pantries and soup kitchens around the city.  Seriously tons.  
  
You've also got [ORGANIZATION].  [ORGANIZATION] most of these places are giving out bus tokens so you can get from one to the other as-needed.  They all hand out toiletries, socks, whatever.   
  
So.... food, shelter, and transit is covered..... your money 100% goes to feed the addiction.  Not half, not ""some,"" it is nearly 100% being spent on drugs/alcohol.   It. Does. Not. Help. At. All.   They'll never be able to save enough dollar bills to put a deposit on an apartment or whatever you think they're doing with it.  There's no utility in a few dollars here and there.  It's not POSSIBLE to use it effectively.  The only thing that's effective is accepting REAL help from community organizations who will hit you with a barrage of resources to get on your feet.  **The real help is all [ORGANIZATION] as well.

I volunteer at [ORGANIZATION] occasionally on [ORGANIZATION]. If you're homeless and went there you'd get a meal, a shower, clean clothes, a [STREET] to get mail, and an opportunity for employment. 

Honestly, if you're homeless 9/10 times you don't have an unemployment problem-- you have an addiction or mental health problem. All the jobs in the world aren't going to help you overcome the problems those things create, i.e. you couldn't hold a job if you tried."

DATE0, I gave a panhandler a dollar, and he thanked me, and as he was moving on to ask someone else, he said to me that he only needed $3 more to be able to stay at the shelter. Clearly, that wasn't a sob story designed to get my money, because he already had a dollar from me and was moving on.

So I looked it up. Some shelters do charge money, especially for people who have been homeless for [LOCATION]. It might only be $7 or $10-nothing extreme-but it is apparently inaccurate to say that ""real help is all free...it almost never costs money to get help."""

Ive seen alot of ""but they'll spend it on drugs"" and that completely misses the point. Are there some homeless people who may be just young lazy junkies? sure. With that said thats such a small minority when compared to veterans, people with mental disabilities, people who went in debt due to medical costs etc.

&#x200B;

Then I read [ORGANIZATION] provides enough so they shouldn't need to pan handle. - Sure [ORGANIZATION] provides plenty for the homeless who are sound of mind and able to patiently and civilly wait [TIME] for a chance of food and shelter ( when the shelters aren't full) but a good many of homeless suffer greatly from mental health issues and have a huge deep seeded paranoia of shelters.

Dont be so one dimensional in your thought process and try and read between the lines of what else we can improve.

Should panhandlers be dodging and weaving through streets to get your money - No - thats traffic enforcement in general. If theres a person on the side of the [STREET] not bothering anyone looking for a few bucks thats up to you if you wanna give them money or not. Having an officer stop traffic to give you a ticket instead of working to prevent the need for panhandlers is foolish. Feel free to disagree, thats my take."

If people would stop giving them money then maybe they'd be forced to use the resources that could get them off the [STREET] and by extension, off of drugs. Its at least worth a shot provided [ORGANIZATION] has the manpower to enforce.

Right now most of the panhandlers are stuck in this cycle where they stand on the corner for money, use the money to score, go get high and then head over to the [ORGANIZATION] for a [STREET] to crash / get clean clothes / get food (whether they've OD'd or not). I'm not saying all of them are like that, but enough are that the [ORGANIZATION] is basically a transient hotel.

Yeah, I was kinda thinking the same thing. I mean, the panhandlers wandering into traffic and the squeegee boys yelling at drivers and denting their cars are the ones *more* in the wrong.

However, I'm wondering if this law may stand since it deals with safety for drivers and pedestrians. It essentially criminalizes a behavior *while driving*...like texting while driving, for example. Texting, even when stopped at a red light, is prohibited in many jurisdictions. Similarly, this law would prohibit giving to panhandlers while ""driving"" since it endangers you, the panhandler, and other drivers."

Town of Gilbert]([URL] was decided in [ORGANIZATION], basically all anti-panhandling laws have been shot down as unconstitutional. Nearly all of these local laws cite them same ""aggressive panhandling"" as a safety issue, but really, they're only able to enforce that on private property (on business property, near ATMs, or at other certain locations where one ""can expect to not be harrassed""). Not to mention, none of these laws stop a guy with a clipboard from asking for donations to a charity to help feed the homeless, but they do stop an individual from asking money to feed him/herself, which is highly contradictory.

Trust me -- I walk \~2 miles each [STREET] to FAC0 to catch the train. There are very few blocks between FAC1 and FAC2 where I won't get asked for something (the main reason I wear headphones, despite the ""but yer safety!"" arguments we see against them all the time) so I understand that it's a nuisance, but as far as I'm concerned it's just part of living in a city (I grew up in [ORGANIZATION], went to school in [PERSON], spent some time in GPE2, and I'm here now -- it's all the same regardless of where you go -- it's just much more prominent in GPE3 than I've seen anywhere else)."

In any event I like to wear headphones as well and sadly people will still try to ask me for money anyway.  Just the same I am not giving them any money at all. 

As far as a city is concerned really that's all the more reason why we as private citizens shouldn't be going for it at all.  You aren't going to tell me in a city that you are hungry when there is food all over the [STREET] that's quite cheap. I can easily get several packs of ramen noodles for one dollar and there are plenty of food banks and churches that offer food. 

Housing is another beast because that's a whole lot more expensive but I honestly feel that what it would cost to house each homeless person in [PERSON] would be worth it if it means a better reputation for the city.  Instead of giving millions of dollars to rich people invest in this for the city and when it's more attractive those people will come without being bribed to do so."

1) Libel and slander are civil actions, not criminal. Thus, the state doesn't bring the charges, the victims do, and the victims here are panhandlers. If they are legitimate panhandlers that are poor and transient, they likely don't know how or what they could do about this. If they are professional panhandlers, they probably don't want any extra media attention lest their scheme be discovered.

2) You need to prove that your reputation was damaged, and frankly, transients don't have much of a reputation to begin with. What would their damages be? They aren't losing out on professional opportunities. Any social relationships they have aren't likely any worse.

3) As the saying goes, you can't squeeze blood from a stone, and I don't there is much in the [STREET] of assets to collect from these geniuses that concocted such a dumb scheme.

&#x200B;

\-Pace of life-slower, much more ""calmer"" for lack of a better word

&#x200B;

\-Drivers-terrible, just absolutely terribe! They [STREET] here like either they have all the time in the world to get to wherever they are going, or [STREET] like there's an impeding apocolyptic event and they are trying to get away from it. You'll see a range of driving styles in which they are either very passive, and try to be too nice, or manically aggressive. Drivers here will [STREET] you figurtively and literally up the wall! Just wait  until it snows in [ORGANIZATION], then all hell breaks loose.

&#x200B;

\-General attitude- I think they are friendly and very non pretentious, rough around the edges. [PERSON] reminds me a lot of a smaller version of GPE2 or [PERSON].

&#x200B;

\-This city has a high tolerance for panhandlers, you'll see them a lot.

&#x200B;

spots are very walkable, especially downtown and South [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], GPE6, GPE7. Mass transit, well you're going to be disappointed.  You will also encounter very strong negative emotions towards mass transit and general urban development. The rural/urban divide is strong here. You'll meet city folks who will talk as if they just absolutely hate living in the city some will actively try to stop any and all urban development proposals. As a New Yorker, you'll be straching your head trying to figure out why they hate it so much and try so hard to stop or sabotage any attempts to improve the city, at the same time complain how terrible it is. But you'll also encounter a fierce pride for the city and region, so its very oxymoronic.

&#x200B;

Overall, [PERSON] is a low key, laid back smaller version of GPE2 or [PERSON], but with  very strong Southern overtones overlapping with a Northeastern, industrial, working class culture. It's a city of contrasts. It will make you feel extremely frustrated but also very proud because of its gritty, rough around the edge culture and history that is in many ways unique. Her people will frustrate you, but you'll probably make some of the best friends you'll have.

If you take all the ""hip"" neighborhoods in [ORGANIZATION] combined (GPE2, [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], GPE6, etc.), the scene is the equivalent of only [ORGANIZATION], or only GPE7.

People in [ORGANIZATION] are more friendly and welcoming.  Fewer scenesters (because there are fewer scenes).

You probably won't have any interaction with police in [ORGANIZATION] unless you are the victim of crime.  If you are white, the police will be fine.  If you're black, be careful.

Homeless people in [ORGANIZATION] are more confined to [STREET] corner begging. I rarely see them walking the streets.

Public transit here sucks. Parking is probably about the same as [ORGANIZATION]. 

The biggest culture shock for me when I first moved to [ORGANIZATION] was people's blase' attitudes towards renting apartments.  In [ORGANIZATION], if you see an apartment you want, you go there [TIME] with check in hand and $12,000 in your bank account.  In [ORGANIZATION] I feel like people barely even care to rent to you.  I'd call up people and they'd be like ""I'm busy [ORGANIZATION] and next, and out of town after that.  I'll meet you in [LOCATION].""  I'm like, no, I want to rent right now!"

We have terrible mass transit. Like, abhorrently bad. Especially if you end up working in the county. Traffic is similar but [PERSON] drivers are probably the worst in the nation in regards to aggressiveness. I've seen some truly stupid behavior on the [STREET]. There are a lot of good restaurants in the city and good food to be had, that's a plus. Probably not quite as multi-cultural as GPE2 though. [PERSON] natives can be pretty friendly, but you're going to have your fair share of assholes. I noticed when in GPE4 that NYers are friendly and will strike up conversation with just about anyone, in [PERSON] you'll usually get left alone. People don't really chit chat or try to talk to you for the most part. There are some truly destitute portions of the city where crime is rampant - and you want to avoid being alone at [TIME] in these areas at all costs. Some parts of [PERSON] are pretty walkable so it depends on where you end up - some parts of this walkability banks on you walking through bad neighborhoods, so that's up to you. Lots of heroin addicts and opioid addicts in the city. You'll see them ""snoozing"" on park benches in weird positions at all times of [ORGANIZATION]. Lots of panhandlers and homeless. Avoid the ""squeegee boys"" at all costs. 

[PERSON] how GPE4ers are with the snow and rain but [PERSON] drivers can not - for their lives - figure out how to [STREET] safely and efficiently in rain or snow. Be prepare for major traffic delays if it rains or snows, forget ice. Stay home."

What are some interesting lifestyle differences/similarities?,"Bottom line, if you're looking for a UES/UWS/[ORGANIZATION]/Park Slope equivalent, you won't find it here. A better comparison would be between the [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] neighborhoods of [PERSON] and the GPE2/GPE3 (waterfront) neighborhoods of [PERSON]. Both have a ton of bars/restaurants and a healthy mix of [ORGANIZATION] and families.

I moved from [ORGANIZATION] to [PERSON] DATE1 and, in my opinion, the two cities are really nothing alike. Cost of living is the obvious difference in that its cheaper to buy a home in [PERSON] than it is to rent, whereas in [LOCATION] buying a home in neighborhoods closest to GPE7 (or a decent subway line) is reserved for those above a certain income threshold. 

As for the little things, parking sucks in the trendy areas of both cities. Both are noisy if you're near a train line (I lived above a freight line when I first moved to [PERSON]), both are easily walkable it really just depends on how far you're going. Public transit isn't even remotely comparable...for the most part owning a car in [LOCATION] is too much of a pain to be worth it (the parking tax will make this evenworse), [PERSON] its a pain NOT to have one (I tried). As for panhandlers, in [LOCATION] they're underground, in [PERSON] they're out in the open...same thing, different [STREET]. With the exception of pizza, food in [PERSON] is better (with a surprising amount of variety) and for the most part, cheaper. A night out in [PERSON] will cost us $150 vs $300+ in [LOCATION]. The beer scene is significantly better here than in [LOCATION], if thats your thing.

Anything else, feel free to ask."

As a native of there it really annoys me how what used to be my home was overrun by a number of folks that don't respect the local history or culture.  There isn't much integration just this idea of ha, ha ha, we're here now do everything our [STREET].

This was something in common that I had with an elderly woman that grew up in [PERSON]. Listening to her talk at a local book store it was quite entertaining to hear her tales of what once was and it sounded very much like stuff I've felt before.

Part of the lack of pretentiousness comes from being willing to work hard.  There is just a certain mentality that comes from that in contrast with someone that isn't used to that. 

As far as panhandlers are concerned there are a lot of them here and I really wish that was something that was addressed already.  

One thing about [ORGANIZATION] is that people here do not like to cross at a crosswalk. They will walk right in front of a car as if they want to get hit to cross the [STREET].

Depends on DATE1, the weather, how many other people are out panhandling, and if they run into any generous people.

Spend [TIME] in a shelter and report back on your experience. Shelters are miserable and you'll get your crap stolen and the staff will magically lose your medication.

[ORGANIZATION] is a process that takes DATE5. The majority of people who are homeless became homeless going through the process, and [ORGANIZATION] isn't making it any better by insisting people need to work in order to get benefits.

You hang out near a busy gas station or store and ask for change. Let's average it out to 1 out of 4 people giving you a dollar. You ask 60 people in [TIME], you've made $15.

Do a quick [ORGANIZATION] search, and you will find hundreds of organizations that need your donations to make positive social change in [ORGANIZATION].

Thrown-away children are more likely to come from single-parent homes.

Vacant house next door was in foreclosure and vacant for [LOCATION]. [ORGANIZATION] acquired it, flipped it, and put it on the market when the market was hot. Lots of interested buyers. 

Then, not DATE2 after it was listed, people moved in in the middle of the night. Then moved in more stuff [PERSON]. There seemed to be random people showing up at random times, but the piles of trash on the back porch kept building up and not being taken to the curb. Then we started seeing rats and more flies. 

Then their grass started getting really long. We tried talking to them but they were rarely around, showing up intermittently, with different people in different cars. And, unfortunately, sometimes a little girl aged around 4 [LOCATION] old.

Once the rats started showing up more in our yard I filed multiple 311s on the ORG1 app. The city would come mow the lawn and leave a bill, but the trash remained. 

Finally, [PERSON], an eviction notice was on the door!! The sheriff came to evict but no one was there. The electricity had been shut off for [ORGANIZATION] so we hadn‚Äôt seen anyone come back for a while: 

[PERSON], the mortgage company hired someone to change the locks and clean out the house. I chatted with the guys cleaning it out who said there was no furniture, but piles of designer bags, trash, and weed ashtrays on every window. The new fridge was so disgusting inside they taped it up and threw the whole thing away.

I talked with the broker who managed the property who said that they were squatters, and this has been a huge problem all over the city. It took DATE8 for the courts to allow them to evict these people and take the property back. DATE9 after the house was cleaned out, the ‚Äúlandlord‚Äù and ‚Äútenant‚Äù showed up, trying to get in, confused why their keys didn‚Äôt work, and searched the porch for a hidden key. They gave up and left, but [LOCATION]0, police returned because another neighbor saw someone trying to break in. 

The brokers put big huge locks on all the doors. That probably turned off prospective buyers, but eventually someone did buy it and now we have lovely neighbors who take out their trash and mow their lawn! Couldn‚Äôt ask for much more than that. 

All this taught me about squatters and how to spot potential squatters. Turns out all my 311 requests helped a lot to get the courts to back up evicting them. If they‚Äôre not caring for the property and causing a public health concern, they have more evidence to support they are squatting and must be evicted. Otherwise it can be hard to get them out. 

Good luck! This whole thing lasted [LOCATION]1 for us."

The legal term for squatters rights is adverse possession. In order to make a claim of adverse possession, if I remember correctly, the person would have to live there for [ORGANIZATION] without you noticing or telling them to leave. 

Really not sure why you're having to go through the eviction process every time for what amounts to trespassers. Just because someone isn't currently occupying a home doesn't mean that it's a free-for-all, and that anyone can just jump in there with a sleeping bag and a change of clothes and say they live there. If that were true, none of us would go on vacation, [ORGANIZATION]. And I would live in a waaay nicer house. 

To my understanding, the police should be able to escort someone off of your property if they are trespassing without you having to file any type of eviction paperwork. They certainly wouldn't be able to present any evidence that they are on the property with your permission; they don't have a lease, a rental agreement, and [ORGANIZATION] receipt, phone calls or text messages between you and them agreeing to let them stay there for free.

My suggestion, if the police aren't helping, would be to reach out to [ORGANIZATION] legal aid or the [ORGANIZATION] pro bono project ([ORGANIZATION]) to see if you could speak to an attorney about low/no cost options. If your father is elderly, look into free legal services for seniors, like this one: [URL] . This seems like the exact type of thing they would be interested in helping with, since people are taking advantage of the fact that your father is ill and vulnerable and unable to care for his property.

Well... It's not ""legal"" to tell the police that you just now drove by and noticed the person there, when you actually already knew. Dunno how they could prove you're lying, or why they'd want to, but.... Not supposed to lie on a police report.


It's unlikely that the police will do anything to the squatters if they appear to be occupying the property. If it looks like they're just chilling, partying, not establishing residence, you could probably ask the police to take action. If the people appear to have set up a home base, you have to go through eviction same as before.


However frustrating this may be, this is the law.¬†"

My block group was able to get help from the police by calling the mayor‚Äôs office [ORGANIZATION]. We took turns, called [ORGANIZATION] until police started coming to the house. The squatters left after [LOCATION] of the police knocking on the door [ORGANIZATION]. I don‚Äôt know if this will work for you, it only worked for one house in my area.

We also reported the stolen electricity to [ORGANIZATION] 1-[PHONE]. When the squatters steal the electricity wires that can catch fire. The [ORGANIZATION] workers came out within [ORGANIZATION] to disconnect the wires. 

One house has squatters who empty the toilet water into the backyard because the drains are clogged. A man from ORG1 came out for a 311 request for that house.

Like someone else posted, it is a civil matter and that takes time. The police probably can‚Äôt do anything because it is not up to them to determine who owns the house vs. who is renting (which the squatters will claim they are doing), vs. who is there illegally.

The owner (in this case the bank) would have to go through the courts and get an eviction, then get the sheriff to serve the eviction. In [ORGANIZATION] city it can take [ORGANIZATION]. (I actually know a lot of landlords who will pay a squatter cash to leave voluntarily).

The other option is to make life so annoying for the squatters that they leave voluntarily. Are they hooked up to the electric grid legally? If they're stealing utilities then [ORGANIZATION] will certainly take care of that. The police or housing inspectors knocking on the door [ORGANIZATION] will also be annoying. 

Banks usually don't bother doing this - they're not landlords, they don't want to manage the property. They want to bank. Chances are the bank will eventually sell the house either through a realtor or an auction house to an investor who will then have to deal with the squatters and rehab the house. You can try to accelerate this process by letting someone at the bank know about the squatters. Ask whoever mows the lawn for their contact. Chances are it's a realtor or property manager in the area who is dealing with a portfolio of properties. If you let them know what's going on they might decide to move on this one quickly.

You've changed the topic by talking about homeless people. The homeless are homeless for reasons that have little to do with affordable housing. Most homeless are people with substantial drug and mental problems, the only housing they can feasibly have is free housing. And not all of them would take it, believe it or not. 

Among the non homeless who qualify for subsidized housing, you're also talking about very poor people. No matter how cheap housing is, this segment,  who are poor largely due to lack of education or skills, will never afford to own or rent on their own. Homeownership and even unsubsidized renting at a minimum requires a certain threshold for both finances and reliability and is not related to housing affordability. That threshold is pretty low. The very poor's lack of experience, skills or education is not related to the affordability of housing. 

For normal people who can hold on to jobs and get on with life, there isn't a housing shortage or affordability problem in [ORGANIZATION]. It may not be fancy or in a good school district, but it's not difficult to buy or rent a decent [STREET] and have a dry roof over your head and is affordable and safe enough.

Jobs given to disabled people for being disabled have frequently been predatory (sheltered workshops etc) and your ideas seem about on that same line. It would be better to improve access and stregthen anti discrimination laws than to do as you're suggesting.

With children, I'm sure you must be aware how expensive childcare is, with more than one small child it can be more than what someone earns at a minimum wage job.

And yes what I left off, childless abled adults who are poor, so I think housing is a basic human right and I think they should be able to get housing*, but I think it can be more basic than the housing for families, disabled adults and elderly people. 

Right now people have to go in periodically to show they're still poor and still need housing, I haven't seen anyone suggest changing that.

Using tax policy to subsidize luxury apartments where there is not enough demand for them distorts the market in a couple ways.

1.) Affordable housing cannot be built where luxury housing is being built.  If [ORGANIZATION] is growing, they need housing expansion of  of all kinds.

2.) Tax subsidies for luxury housing mean there are less subsidies for lower cost housing.  Only so much tax deals to go around.

3.) There are now comparatively less affordable housing than luxury housing, and more people demanding it.  Price goes up.

4.) The holders of empty luxury housing are under less pressure to lower rent to bring in tenants because the sweet tax deals help them hold the land and wait while the value of the land goes up.  Eventually either tenants will eventually come or you sell the land at a profit.

7,2017-12-24 06:32:28 UTC,1,2017-12-25 19:44:32 UTC,How Tax Breaks for Wealthy Developers Fueled an Affordable Housing Crisis in [ORGANIZATION],"Thanks for the reply, I appreciate you addressing the points.

1.). You are right that affordable housing wouldn't necessarily get built in plots where luxury housing is built, but something else would.  These 'Other things' might compete with affordable housing, or they might compete with still other things that eventually would compete with affordable housing.  Land is inelastic and no part of a city is an island.  It's true that you can't put any building just anywhere but overbuilding one type of structure does affect the supply of land for others, even in other parts of a city.

2) it would be really helpful to have concrete numbers for this sort of thing, but the law of subsidy seems illustrative.  (Subsidize something and you get more of it.). If [ORGANIZATION] isn't growing at a fast rate, we should have an overcapacity of whatever is being subsidized most especially since supply is out of step with demand.

3.) That is a fair point.  It impacts point 2 as well, I'll admit.  I would say that the relationship of overbuilt luxury housing should hold even if we limit the scope to just those neighborhoods.

4.)Do you know why the alternative is often a parking lot? Because they are the most efficient use of land when you figure in property taxes.  If a land owner wants to make an easy buck he just holds land in an area with rising property values, puts up something that adds no value to the community (and thus does not attract the eye of the assessor) and waits for land values to rise enough for him to sell.

LOL You've got to be kidding. We need housing supply, and yes people need cars.  The reason you see so many dealerships is because there is a demand for cars.

The affordable housing trust fund is geared towards a similar demographic (low income households) but would provide assistance to renters AND homeowners through local (city) public funding but also from private sources. It would encourage inclusionary (mixed) housing development rather than force people to pick their housing based solely on where a landlord would accept their voucher. Most vouchers are redeemed in [ORGANIZATION] so the trust could theoretically slightly help spatially distribute these households throughout the city.

but you can't have robust transit without better public safety. people don't like taking transit if they don't feel safe. our ridership per unit density is terrible, even along corridors with great transit (metro, light rail). other cities with similarly little rail have much better ridership.

> realistic job opportunities

again, public safety drives away businesses, residents with more disposable income, and tourists, which all reduce available jobs. there is an economic phenomenon called the ""economic multiplier effect"" where money into an area from outside has an effect on the local economy that is much greater (multiplied by 1/marginal propensity to save). for the [ORGANIZATION], that's typically between 5x and 10x. so every tourist that brings money into the city has as much as 10x the economic stimulus as someone within the city spending that money. however, we have squeegee kids, dirtbikers, shootings, assaults, etc. etc. that [STREET] tourists away, and with them go jobs. governments don't create most jobs, spending creates jobs because that spending becomes someone's income, which then gets spent and becomes someone else's income, etc. etc..   

&#x200B;

>quality affordable housing

again, we have plenty of housing stock, but if people don't feel safe, there won't be high demand to live in them, so they aren't valuable enough to keep in good shape, so they either fall apart or a slumlord buys them and puts the minimum required repairs to keep it making money. without a good economy, the ability for people to own homes is diminished and the incentive to fix them up is also diminished."

This isn't true, at least not in [ORGANIZATION]. City churches usually have congregations from outside the immediate neighborhood.  Source: my company builds a lot of parking lots, we do a lot of parking lots for churches. They want big parking lots with tall fences and locking gates to keep out the ""locals"". Some of the church project quotes are hundreds of thousands of dollars for secure parking lots to keep out the ""poor"". It's pretty messed up.

Churches are tax exempt because originally, they did some of the social services the government would otherwise do. Shelter the homeless, feed the poor, take care of orphaned kids and vacant land.  The tax exemption is the reward for those services. They don't pay property tax or income tax. AND a lot of churches rent out their space, so that's tax free income. PLUS they get government grants and money from outside their congregations.

I was thinking churches need to contribute effort, not funding. Three of the churches in my area left because of political bs. Before they left one had a thrift store run by retired older women, they did spaghetti dinners for everyone in the neighborhood to get to know each other, they had a food pantry that was part of the [ORGANIZATION] system, they had a volunteer social worker who referred people to services. Another church held community picnics in the park and did community clean ups with us. The third church had a mens group that mentored people. I don't think those activities cost much money. It takes a lot of effort and people work hours. The churches bring people into the neighborhood. Those people could put some effort into making the are better instead of donating money to keep the locals out."

210,2022-02-08 14:07:17 UTC,1,2022-02-08 18:39:33 UTC,[ORGANIZATION],"> With all due respect though, the quote of mine you highlighted does absolutely appear to be the major issue with inclusionary zoning based on the report you linked.
 
Unless, I misunderstood what you're saying, you seem to be arguing that developers would naturally make affordable housing if there was a profit in it for them.  But affordable housing by its very nature of being affordable, doesn't generate profit.  Even if it did, I'm not sure a developer would build them anyway because the profit will never be as high as what they'd get for a full value house.  But that's a housing/profit issue not an inclusionary zoning issue.  [PERSON] zoning is the solution to this problem not a cause.  You have to force (incentivize if you will) developers to build affordable housing which is what this law tried to do.  However, the law, as written, states they only have to include affordable houses if the city has the funds to help pay for it.  But the city doesn't have any money in the budget or anyway of getting that money to pay the builders.  That creates a situation where the builders don't actually have to include affordable housing because there is no legal motive nor profit advantage to do so - so they don't.  This passage from the report gets to the core issues with the law written as it is:

> Since [ORGANIZATION], the current policy has produced only 37 units (primarily due to projects being exempted from providing affordable units since the required [ORGANIZATION] contribution would exceed established cost thresholds per unit). 

In other words, the city only had money to force developers to include 37 affordable housing units since [ORGANIZATION] so that's all that got built.  This quote gets to the core of the issues with the current law:

> ...[T]he current policy sets a threshold on the amount of funding the [ORGANIZATION] of [PERSON] can provide for an affordable unit.  If the cost per affordable unit exceeds the threshold, the developer can be exempted from providing the affordable units.  Figure 2 below provides the threshold limits for total [ORGANIZATION] contribution per affordable unit, which varies based on the [ORGANIZATION] served.  The thresholds limits are fixed and do not adjust over time based on inflation or increased development costs.  As a result, the ability to fund units within the threshold becomes more difficult with [ORGANIZATION]Figure 2 shows that, as of the report (DATE2, I believe) 1 60% [ORGANIZATION] studio apartment and 2 100% [ORGANIZATION] 1 bedroom apartments are covered by the funds the city has available, meaning anything else isn't covered and a developer doesn't have to build it.  


>I also found it interesting that the report says [PERSON] would have generated more affordable housing units if it had not done a subsidy to developers but just lowered the requirements so that only 5-10% of new units must be affordable. Hopefully the new policy improves on that because that is a pretty horrendous stat.

It is interesting and going on the numbers they provide it would have been 1080 units (instead of the 540 estimate they have) if the city had just funded the law properly.  It's not even large numbers they talk about in the report - $3 million over the life of each project to fully support the entire 20%. The [cities budget]([URL] for [ORGANIZATION] is $3.5billion.  This is doable, but nobody wants to actually do it."

2. There are some homeless people downtown. I lived alone downtown when I was fresh out of college and it never bothered me. That includes walking my dog alone at [TIME]. 
3. I'm not sure why they're so affordable, but my 4 bed/2 bath was less than half the cost of all my friends' homes in the surrounding suburbs. It's in great shape and I have a backyard!
4. I ended up in [ORGANIZATION], but after living here for [ORGANIZATION], would never leave.
5. Some neighborhoods are more family-friendly than others. I haven't lived in [PERSON] or [ORGANIZATION], but from what I've seen, they tend to run [ORGANIZATION]'s, no-kids. Look at some of the neighborhoods in East [ORGANIZATION] for more family-friendliness ([PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], GPE6, etc.). My neighborhood has 2 playgrounds within walking distance and is surrounded by three large parks.
6. Bonus: I'm a first grade teacher here. [ORGANIZATION] gets a bad rep for education, but amazing changes are happening. Our district has some of the best curriculum in the country. Everything is aligned to [ORGANIZATION] (so your kid will actually learn how to read, instead of memorizing words). There's a ton of great programs in city schools right now. Your daughter will likely be successful in any school she goes to, GPE7 or not. Also, some of those ""great"" schools (cough, [ORGANIZATION], cough) get overcrowded. Just something to consider.

FAC0 has lots of events, [ORGANIZATION] has tons of great restaurants and dive bars, [PERSON] is the arts districts with first [ORGANIZATION] art walks [LOCATION], creative alliance events, and lots of cool little shops and more diverse than the others. [ORGANIZATION] is still building up and is more of apartments but has some nice little spots of its own and is a good discount over [ORGANIZATION]. If you want the family vibe. [ORGANIZATION] has some nice newish FAC1, which have a lot of early families and a quieter vibe, feels kind of like suburbs in the city with more open grassy areas and generally quiet neighbors, but less of a nice area in terms of things to do/crime. Not dangerous per se just have to [STREET] to most places for food/events so loses the walkability factor.

[ORGANIZATION] is the established nicest area, but all 3 are low crime ([PERSON] south of [LOCATION] and west of [PERSON] ave are the same safety profile). Walkability to everything, many events and fun breweries/events for kids. It will be noisier so just have to be prepped for that, but if you find a good neighborhood with 1) brick walls or ideally brick walls plus drywall for sound reduction and 2) good, respectful neighbors, the noise isn't so bad.

Also for [PERSON] this trio of neighborhoods has really been on the rise, so you can expect strong home value appreciation in the long-term. People that don't know [PERSON] complain about the murder rate, if you avoid the (obvious) areas of boarded up homes and high crime it is no problem. [ORGANIZATION]/[PERSON]/[ORGANIZATION] average maybe 1 murder DATE2 despite being one of the most populous areas of the city. Great people, fun events, fairly inexpensive and an area constantly growing. Really IMO the only thing missing is more live music, where [PERSON] takes a big W.

As many have said, there are tons of nice neighborhoods so find your right fit, I just know these 3 very well. Dont listen to anyone that doesn't currently live in [PERSON] about homeless/crime, they either are ignorant of it and follow the generic racist chatter of cities being a murder haven (not that its without issue but every neighborhood is unique so you can't group west [PERSON] with the safer-than-suburbs [ORGANIZATION]), and people that moved out often lead a different life now and trash the city they loved at the right time in their life. It might also be worth renting a spot for [ORGANIZATION] so 1) the housing market cools off and 2) its easier for you to day trip it to spots you'd consider living long-term. If the market plays right you may save money by renting for [ORGANIZATION] and also finding the right home for you."

2. While crime is high per capita, it is generally targeted and contained to certain neighborhoods. That‚Äôs not good for many reasons, but it‚Äôs not like most of us are out here fighting for our lives in the [ORGANIZATION]. There are certainly homeless people but to say there are vagrants everywhere is incorrect. 
3. I‚Äôve lived here [LOCATION] and still haven‚Äôt figured it out. Crime rates? Poor public transportation? Lacks the scenery of [ORGANIZATION] cities? Lacks the glamor of [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], and [PERSON]? Like someone else mentioned, while houses are cheap, cost of living adds up. 
4. [ORGANIZATION] tends to be a [STREET] where you‚Äôre all in, or you want out. So if you find your [STREET] here, you‚Äôll love it. I think people can definitely be called. 
5. [PERSON] and LOC2 are nice neighborhoods with good elementary schools, plenty of kids and kid friendly places. Though it is also popular with college kids/early 20, especially some of the bars. I feel like the DATE2 night time crowds have been bigger since things opened back up after [PERSON], compared to pre-[PERSON].

There's plenty of cheaper housing elsewhere in the city. There is, in fact, no shortage of affordable housing in the city.

The simple reality is that most middle class folks stay away from the city entirely because of schools and crime and convenience. Of those who want to stay in the city, there is, as I mentioned several times, no shortage of affordable decent housing. It's just not in fashionable or popular neighborhoods and means living in places like [ORGANIZATION], off FAC0, in the far east and far west.

Look, I am a black, middle to upper middle class agnostic single nurse with no kids. I used to work [TIME]s. I only live in neighborhoods where I feel completely comfortable walking to and from my car at [TIME] or like taking the trash out at mid[TIME]. Will I do those things? Not much anymore because I'm old. But if I want to, I want to feel like I comfortably can. That should give you an overall impression of the neighborhoods I am about to discuss. 

I have lived in [ORGANIZATION] (suburb right on the border of [PERSON] proper), [PERSON] (suburb deep in [LOCATION] which is like a [TIME] [STREET] from both [PERSON] and [PERSON]), and [PERSON] ([ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION], [PERSON], and now [ORGANIZATION]). I would recommend any of those neighborhoods to anyone.

--[ORGANIZATION] is fine. Boring and bland with typical suburban shopping. Like strip malls/shopping plazas, [ORGANIZATION]. A nearby [PERSON] and ORG2. Car centric. At the terminus of the one subway line if that matters. A short [STREET] to a light rail stop. You need a car. You know what it reminds me of? [ORGANIZATION] but [STREET] worse mass transit. 

--[PERSON] is fine. Another boring and bland suburb but more üí∞üíµüí∞. Good location if you need access to both [PERSON] and [PERSON] though. In the [PERSON]0, wealth makes good schools because schools are mostly funded by local tax: money follows the wealthy people and the poor people just get scraps. [LOCATION] is a case study in the former. You need a car. Same access to suburban stuff like strip malls, [PERSON], ORG2. Just ORG3 history of [PERSON], [PERSON]1. They planned it to be diverse, and it still kinda is. But money, power, and respect are still very tied to proximity to whiteness in this country then and now so, I dunno. Just see for yourself. I'm not familiar with many of the wealthy suburbs of [PERSON]2 but probably approximately like that. I dunno, [PERSON]3? 

--[PERSON] :

*[ORGANIZATION] is a suburb in the city. You need a car. Very bucolic and pretty peaceful imo. But expensive. [LOCATION] and [PERSON] are basically core of urban [PERSON]. Lots of historic beautiful architect ture, walkable to parks, and the waterfront. Mostly renters some homeowners. I could not afford to buy over there, but I rented there for [ORGANIZATION] and loved it. A good neighborhood for families that want to stay in the city but also like suburban trappings. Maybe like getting off at FAC0 in [PERSON]2. 

*[LOCATION] and [PERSON]: probably the best places I've lived in my time in [PERSON]4. There are more homeless services in downtown than [PERSON] so the homeless of the city are concentrated in [LOCATION], right next to expensive condos and apartments, government buildings, etc. Lots of walkabilty and access to subway stops and light rail depending where you live in [LOCATION] or [PERSON]. Good amount of bike lanes. Access to regional and interstate train stations in or near both. Both are my favorite places I've lived in [PERSON]. The most city feeling of the neighborhoods I've lived in in [PERSON]. You have to be aware of your surroundings in any city, same in [PERSON]. I was more vigilant in [LOCATION] and [PERSON] than [ORGANIZATION]. [LOCATION] and [PERSON] could be comparable to the neighborhoods around [PERSON]5 and FAC1 stations in [PERSON]2. Maybe even FAC2 for some parts of downtown. 

*[ORGANIZATION] is what I am now calling an urban rowhome suburb. To the north and east are areas with more crime, but this legit feels like a bubble. It's walkable to [LOCATION] and the waterfront. Lots of city services. Lots of wealthy or middle class homeowners but a fair share of renters. Racially mixed, but probably 60/30 white to other races? That is a guess, I haven't looked at [ORGANIZATION] data lately. Most of the crime in [LOCATION], [PERSON], and [ORGANIZATION] is property crime. My neighbors kids go to [PERSON] schools they literally walk to from their homes. People walk their dogs [TIME] of the day and nigh in [ORGANIZATION]. You are still in the city, so must be aware of your surroundings. You can walk to the metro at FAC3 which is the other terminus for the subway line. There are buses. But you will most likely need a car. [STREET] parking if you don't have a parking pad or garage. I get [PERSON]6 and LOC2 vibes here, but not as much money and a bit grittier. The architecture here is not, though. I'd say [PERSON] neighborhoods of [PERSON]7, [ORGANIZATION] have housing stock more similar to [PERSON]6 than the [PERSON] style in [ORGANIZATION]. 

Occasionally people get mugged around here ([ORGANIZATION]), but I haven't heard of any in a while. Probably slightly higher frequency in [LOCATION] and [PERSON]. It's getting warmer now so I'm sure more ne'er-do-wells will be ne'er-do-welling.

--

Hope this helps somewhat. If someone natives of [PERSON]2 could jump in, they'd probably give better descriptors than me. These are not the only livable neighborhoods these are just the ones I have lived in. I would have loved to live in [LOCATION] for example or even [PERSON], but the real estate gods were not on my side [LOCATION]."

Like 50-60% [ORGANIZATION] with fixed rent below market for how nice the apartments but at an amount completely unaffordable to actual poor people who need 30% of income subsidies?

I can't read this because of the paywall so I don't know if it's made clear, but when developers say affordable they almost always mean the first one which uses the LIHTC and not 30% of income subsidies which are far more needed, far more in shortage and what public housing units are which means the city would be losing even more of those. When politicians talk about affordable housing it's often not clear, but I suspect they usually mean LIHTC because there's really  no substantial political will for creating more 30% of income subsidies in the form of more public housing or even fixing the current stock rather than giving away or selling it for less than value to private developers, or creating more section 8 vouchers or project based in substantial enough numbers to make a real difference."

The section 8 voucher list has been closed in [ORGANIZATION] for a long time, it briefly opened for a lottery and closed again. Even the public housing list closed. People who lose public housing like this often get vouchers if they're not transferred to other public housing, but that doesn't solve the issue of being able to use the voucher. If they get a voucher and can't use it in the specified time then they will end up either becoming homeless or paying 90% of their income in rent. That's not a better situation. You don't actually know if they're all getting a better situation. That's the problem with this, that's the problem with all the closure of projects and the scheme where they've given the high rises to private companies who must keep them subsidized for [ORGANIZATION] and can do whatever they want after that.

Deconcentrating poverty with vouchers or some other type of subsidy is a good idea if there are enough of them and if the amount covers places other than in poor neighborhoods (because then what's the difference really) and some kind of real system to incentivize or require more landlords to take them.

Right now, nation-wide, and [PERSON] is not better as it's one of the most rent burdened city in the country, 70% of people the [ORGANIZATION] calls extremely low income (30% [ORGANIZATION]) do not have access to housing affordable to them‚Äîsubsidized or otherwise.

I'm not really opposed to affordable housing at all, but this is a [STREET] that has no residents to begin with. No one is being priced out. No is being forced out of the [STREET] their family has lived for [ORGANIZATION]. This is basically a barren patch of land outside of a few plants and a seafood restaurant, more or less. Personally I think the idea of them contributing to other improvements in the city, in neighborhoods that really need it, is more beneficial and reasonable, rather than trying to make what is essentially a luxury neighborhood more inclusive. Them making contributions to the surrounding neighborhoods in the southwest is a good start.

Is the idea that affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION] will allow clusters of lower income from other parts of the city to spread out a bit more? Not trying to be facetious, honest inquiry."

For example, the replacing of the park for affordable housing that the one councilman suggested is a non-starter.

With a redevelopment like FAC0 you're required by [ORGANIZATION] to have some open area and forcing that much more impervious area is going to be an entire redesign from a stormwater management perspective.

What is their endgame with the affordable housing at [ORGANIZATION]? Is it to bring in more lower income to [ORGANIZATION] from the surrounding counties (we've already got plenty of that) or is to break up the clusters of lower income we already have?

Basically it's like the underpants gnomes' from [ORGANIZATION] business model. First step is build affordable housing. Second step is ???. Third step is a more equitable and inclusive city. I'm just trying to figure out what that second step is. Maybe a combo of both?

Again, this is a patch of land with no one really living on it to begin with. This is one of the few situations where I say bring all of the rich people in. Yeah there are certain taxes that will go towards the [ORGANIZATION], but there are also plenty of spending dollars as well as income taxes for those that work in the city, but not for [ORGANIZATION], that can help alleviate the city with helping and supporting the poor and lower income we already have."

Investment companies bought a lot of these owner-occupied properties. Less than half were turned into rentals priced [STREET] above market then subsidized through section 8. Most properties were left empty and refinanced for millions of dollars. It's called [ORGANIZATION]. One house was auctioned off for $75,000 because of housing fines and other tax fees, then refinanced for $1,533,551. No improvements to the house. No one is maintaining it. It went from being a nice house with an elderly couple living there to a vacant nuisance house, home for rats.

I've heard from other neighbors that my councilperson PERSON0 isn't interested in affordable housing. ""It isn't her thing."" I know from experience she isn't responsive to anyone outside her little friend [STREET].

It's really messed up. The refinance thing makes the average sale price for houses in the neighborhood jump up. So other landlords are increasing rent. Our tax assessment is going to go up. But no one is appraising these houses at $250,000 or $300,000. And no one is going to pay $200,000 for a rowhouse in [ORGANIZATION] just because some investment company did a refi for $1.5 million on the vacant next door.

I own my house, so only the property tax increase affects me directly.  The vacants are really bringing the neighborhood down. PLUS our neighborhood lost at least 30 homes from the housing stock. I'm sure that contributes to higher rent and less affordable housing.

I don't know what would help. The more our group researches the worse it looks. It does seem like elected officials are benefiting and don't really care about making sure everyone had access to affordable housing."

Second, it is a significantly debated topic whether the people and the culture of poverty they bring with it causes these developments to fail or whether it is other factors like lack of sustained maintenance or opportunities only provided to more affluent residents.

That's terrible, but that should be addressed with punitive fines for breaking development regulations/ordinances, not by retaliatory disapproval of future projects. 

Especially since [ORGANIZATION] is overruling staff recommendations to approve. And the situation is made worse by the fact that his other building received approval before the area became a historic district, and it's about to break ground.

Either [STREET], building market rate units also reduces overall housing prices. It's called supply and demand. The proven concept around this that increases affordability is called housing filtering. 

This is a pervasive nation conversation right now.

I framed my position with a question directly around exemptions from a restrictive height overlay and parking requirements for affordable housing.

If a developer proposed instead building a building with a certain % of affordable or deeply affordable units, they would be allowed to build taller than the overlay restrictions and reduce or eliminate parking.

It's an outside the box theory, but I just find it interesting. I have never seen so many homeless as I have in [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]. They tend to feed off the strong economies of those areas. Both places are full of young people with high incomes, the kinds of people who will give money to them. These young high earners are the kind of people GPE2 has also been attracting in [ORGANIZATION]. College educated millennial population has skyrocketed.   "

If people are unhoused because they have a profound lack of income or other substantially challenging situations in the regular market, simply building more housing and thus presumably lowering the average cost of housing overall is not going to address the need.

I‚Äôd be interested in knowing how many people are unhoused because housing costs are say 10 to 20% higher than what they can afford, and how many people are unhoused because they have virtually no income and may have other complications such as mental health and substance abuse issues and extremely poor or nonexistent credit. These categories of obstacles would require very different strategies."

I squint at anyone saying that they have a single specific keyhole solution.  It typically ends up being just a goal of theirs specifically, at best tangentially related to the collectives objective/interest.

Although you can certainly find stories of middle class people dropping to homelessness pretty quick in [ORGANIZATION] (it definitely isnt the majority though). 

The problem is no one has yet setup a program that allows safe use, provides shelter, counsels and everything else that goes with recovery. I am not saying that us doing this is that full program but, [ORGANIZATION], it's a start. 

There was a [ORGANIZATION] episode [ORGANIZATION] where a scandanavian country started something similar and it has had hugely positive effects. They followed a woman who got hooked on heroin from a prescription of opioids. She went to clinic to get her ""high"" from a doctor went to work stopped by the clinic in the afternoon to get another ""high"" and then went home to make dinner and feed her kids. DATE1 she was living on the [STREET] after abandoning her kids and husband. Part of the program requirements were checking in [DATE] and the doctor worked to slowly lower her dose over [ORGANIZATION] with the idea that she would be clean by DATE4.

Obviously that program took a ton of money and isn't going to work for everyone but it certainly sounds a lot better than arresting people so they can go to jail and still do heroin in jail anyways.

and on top of that this all ignores the human death toll that is currently happening."

[ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION] all have huge homeless populations.

But housing is certainly a part of the problem. The ""middle class"" in [PERSON] now needs something like $[PERSON] per household just to rent in the city. That means the ""lower class"" doesn't stand a chance. There just aren't apartments or houses that anyone who isn't well above the federal average wage can afford.

You can google GPE4 homeless housing crisis and there are dozens of articles about their lack of affordable housing leading to homelessness."

15,2016-11-11 03:59:27 UTC,1,2016-11-11 20:20:15 UTC,[ORGANIZATION] is slapping an extra 1% tax on vacant houses. Could [PERSON] do the same?,"You can go on about demand [ORGANIZATION], but without an available product, how can you declare it's not there? There's obviously a demand for housing, seeing how successful M on [ORGANIZATION] has been. And the market failed to create something similar. Again, the only reason we ever got past tenement housing and slum conditions was with government intervention. You sound like a college freshman, mesmerized by theory but unable to see the human lives that it impacts.

1. It's a concept. The idea is that without a collective choice being made, we're making poor individual ones, such as a slumlord holding back a neighborhood by waiting to maximize investment.

3. You're misrepresenting what [ORGANIZATION] does. M on [ORGANIZATION] is not ""free money"". It is affordable housing. People that pay rent, but the market failed to create housing for them because the margin wasn't there. Additionally, when you reduce the burden of housing cost, you free up a lot more spending power and can help to develop beyond a basic economy.

4. Why do you think increasing the tax rate on vacant properties is the same thing as seizing them? While OP suggested it, it wouldn't necessarily happen. It would also let the city either target more individual vacants nearest to where people still live or to encourage improvements to them."
