The Best of Baltimore Showed Up For A Homeless Linux Wiz And I'm Grateful But Sad,943,https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/1h02dwv/the_best_of_baltimore_showed_up_for_a_homeless/,2024-11-26 03:30:54 UTC,"It's crazy that I stumbled across this post, because I remember meeting Steve when I lived in Fells. I was doing some software work late at night, so I decided to go to 7/11 for a snack. Steve asked if I had any extra cash so I gave him some money. He asked what I'm doing out there so late in my pajamas since everyone else there was dressed for going to the bars. I told him that I was doing software work, which is when he showed me his Linux tattoo. I asked him what a sysadmin was doing on the streets, which is when he talked about his mental health issues. He seemed like a good guy that just struggled with his demons. He also seemed well liked by his homeless friends he introduced me to.

I'm so sorry for your loss. Steve left a lasting impression on me during that brief encounter, and it‚Äôs clear he had a kind heart despite his struggles. I hope you can find comfort in knowing how he touched the lives of others, even in small, unexpected ways. Wishing you strength and peace during this difficult time.",123,2024-11-26 08:34:49 UTC,homeless

I too was a homeless addict with mental health issues but thankfully I was in the right place at the right time with the right people surrounding me and was able to admit my powerlessness over addiction.  I was not officially diagnosed as borderline until I was 48 and I will forever until I die.be an advocate for those struggling with mental health issues and addiction.

I‚Äôd like to say I was always warm and open hearted about homeless people, but I wasn‚Äôt. For a longtime I felt angry at Steve, because we wanted so badly for him to make better choices, and every time I saw a homeless person I thought, ‚ÄúGet a job and go home and take care of your family‚Äù.  But time and age help us shift our perspectives and while I can‚Äôt intuitively understand why he made the decisions he made, I know he wanted, so badly, to do better. 

He faced some big challenges, and in the later years, getting a job must have been incredibly difficult. How do you get a job with no address, no ID, no recent work history, and no dental care?   It‚Äôs not impossible, but it‚Äôs hard, for sure.   I wish he had found the way out, and the Reddit community surely threw him a lifeline, but I can see how hard it would have been, just the same. With his mental health challenges, it obviously was more than he could manage.

And so with no work, we must rely upon the kindness of strangers.  At the end, and despite all of his struggles and the realities of his life, he still wanted to live.  Thank you for helping someone else to get by another day.",5,2024-11-26 14:25:07 UTC,homeless

2 hotels unveiled as homeless shelters: ‚ÄòSomething like this has never been done in Baltimore‚Äô,521,https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/1dtaq9y/2_hotels_unveiled_as_homeless_shelters_something/,2024-07-02 02:13:10 UTC,"> Baltimore City has transformed two hotels that it purchased this year, the Holiday Inn Express and the Sleep Inn & Suites, into temporary shelters for people experiencing homelessness.
\
... The city bought the hotels and the parking lot between them for $15.2 million, in a deal approved by the Board of Estimates in February. Funds from the federal American Rescue Plan Act covered the cost
\
Simmons said Monday that 378 families have stayed at the hotels so far. With capacity for 175 people, the Sleep Inn is being used as flexible housing for families and couples, the city homelessness office said in a email Monday. Rooms at the Holiday Inn serve men with the capacity to provide emergency shelter to 120.
\Emergency shelters are designed to have lower barriers to entry and address more immediate needs than permanent housing.
\
... Simmons said the goal is to get to 800 shelter beds and convert the hotels into permanent supportive housing. She said the office expects to announce a call for permanent housing applicants in the next couple of weeks.

On a more serious note, OP your life is a train wreck. A lot of this will be under your control, but it'll probably take time to fix it. The first step is going to be accepting that your life is a train wreck. The second step will be coming to the realization that you can do something about it. And third will be doing it and not looking back.

There's definitely a lot of resources/advice on this subreddit regarding homelessness. Use the search function, this is an unfortunately somewhat common ask/topic. There's certainly a range of options out there, including some that are open to women exclusively. I suggest spending some time reading those posts and following up with the advice and/or the people who posted. I guarantee that if you use the search and dig through old posts you'll find some sort of help - I just don't know what it will look like.

Notice how you keep having falling outs with people? Your step mom, the roommate, seems like a past landlord based upon your post history, and I'm sure there's more. Sometimes it's a sound strategic plan to make an effort to NOT piss people off, especially people you might need support from. Maybe the step mom is a horrible person who has MAGA tattooed on her forehead. Just let it slide and realize that having an amicable relationship with your father is going to be substantially higher value to you than getting into some stupid argument.

Look into something like nursing. I'm sure there are some low cost or free programs you could exercise to get into school for nursing. I know area CCs all have programs for nursing of some kind. You could always start somewhere like a nursing home (they're ALWAYS desperate for people) which isn't a fabulous work environment but it's better than this Dairy Queen thing you've got going on. And it's something you could translate into higher pay years down the road. Dental hygienist might be a good option too.

Also, ditch the fiance. Immediately. He's never going to be a positive influence in your life and will drag you down with him. I don't know how your life will turn out but I can guarantee it will suck if you stick with him.",8,2024-02-29 14:22:05 UTC,"homeless, homelessness"

He won‚Äôt take anything from you. Has an alcohol problem, and probably some mental illness. He goes from homeless to sheltered a few times a year, but always ends up back. Guy is very nice and never aggressive. Talks to everyone in the neighborhood, I used to bring him food from time to time or I would walk down to my house and heat up food that he had gotten from somewhere along the way. One of my favorite stories is the day Chipotle gave him a bunch of free food and he walked up and down the street sharing it with all of the other homeless guys on the block. He‚Äôs pretty well taken care of though, my group of friends have given him shoes, blankets when it‚Äôs cold, jackets etc. mainly though he just wants someone to stop and chat with him for a few mins. 

It‚Äôs always nice to want to help someone, it makes you feel good, but be very cautious. When you are talking to homeless people you cannot relate‚Ä¶ your experiences are not theirs. Perhaps instead of asking an Internet forum how you can help, you engage in a conversation with him the next time you see him and ask him if he needs anything. He may not, he may not want your help or the things you ‚Äúthink‚Äù he needs may be offensive or off putting. In order to truly help someone you need to be selfless, do it because you want to help out your fellow man, not so you can post about it online or pat yourself on the back and say what a good job you did(not saying you‚Äôre doing this). Homeless people are no different than you or I, they are still human beings, albeit with very different circumstances. So instead of asking a bunch of people who go home to a house every day what THEY would do, just go talk to him.

> Every year, local television news stations owned by Sinclair Broadcasting conduct short surveys among viewers to help guide the year‚Äôs coverage.

> A key question in each poll, according to David Smith, the company‚Äôs executive chairman: ‚ÄúWhat are you most afraid of?‚Äù

> The answers are evident in Sinclair‚Äôs programming. Crime, homelessness, illegal drug use, failing schools and other societal ills have long been core elements of local TV news coverage. But on Sinclair‚Äôs growing nationwide roster of stations, the editorial focus reflects Smith‚Äôs conservative views and plays on its audience‚Äôs fears that America‚Äôs cities are falling apart, according to media observers, Smith associates, and current and former staffers who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal company matters.

> Smith, an enthusiastic supporter of Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump who has built Sinclair into one of the largest television station operators in the country, purchased the Baltimore Sun last month. In a private meeting with the Sun‚Äôs journalists, he urged them to emulate coverage at the local Sinclair station, Fox45, which in 2021 produced a documentary titled simply ‚ÄúBaltimore Is Dying.‚Äù

If you or anyone else sees this that's a smoker I can tell you from personal experience as a beggar... If you have no cash offer the person a cig. 99% they will take it and be very grateful.

Edit: if you can afford it, another great thing to do is take all the extra plastic bags everyone has a ton of and put a bottle of water, a lil snack like granola bar, those lil disposable hand warmers you can get at the dollar store, possibly some gloves, mittens, hats, a travel toothbrush/toothpaste,  SOCKS are super useful, chapstick, sanitary products like hand sanitizer, tampons/pads, wet wipes, NARCAN is a big one,even for people who arent addicts they all know one and I've saved multiple strangers lives with it (you can usually get it at fire departments,needle exchanges,and pharmacies for free). You can pre pack the bags and keep a couple in your car. It's a good way to get rid of the bags and the bags can actually be used to cover feet to keep them warmer and dry. Cash is the best thing but if you're morally opposed to that the baggie of useful goodies helps. You can also write a lil encouraging note and throw it in there, maybe with some useful numbers like homeless shelters and suicide hotlines (someone else posted some helpful ones in this thread).

In fact most federal homelessness dollars coming into the city are going into housing subsidies and case management. The feds are typically quite reluctant to fund shelters which leaves local communities to pick up most of those costs. Covid changed things with FEMA dollars, but that's not going to last forever.

Vouchers are great for long-term resolution for homelessness, but they are not good at addressing short-term crises. They sound great politically, but people are always disappointed with the implementation. Housing choice vouchers use market-rate landlords and even with source-of-income nondiscrimination in place, many people experiencing homelessness (especially those that are chronically homeless) have bad credit, extensive eviction history, drug addiction, criminal history, etc. making them undesirable tenants even with the guaranteed voucher income. This makes them targets for slumlords. Fortunately, most vouchers come with an inspection requirement... the downside is this significantly slows the process as people moving into these vouchers have to endure multiple inspections. On top of that, vouchers and most landlords will want you to have an ID, Birth Certificate, and a Social Security Card. Fun fact, if you happen to lose all three documents (very common for those that are homeless), how do you prove who you are in order to get them? There's a way to do it, but it's not fun and requires a lot of coordination... (hint you need to get them in a specific order) which is where case managers come in. The city and lots of nonprofits fund case managers to help folks get their vital documents and all of the other paperwork required to apply for these programs. 

This process definitely needs improvement, but even at it's most efficient, it takes time, money, and coordination. Plus, it can be really quick for some people and really slow for others depending on their needs. Also, the fact that vouchers are considered permanent government expenditures, means that funding needs to budget to anticipate the person residing in this housing for years or even decades. Right now there is a national push for a subsidy that expires, but many are afraid that this is just kicking the problem down the road. Plus, with people who are chronically homeless, most funders and landlords will want to see clients having access to a social worker while in their permanent housing units to make sure that they are able to stay stable. That adds more money to the budget for salaries. Is it less expensive than having someone in a shelter and constantly using the emergency room? Sure... in the long run... but in the long run isn't the timeframe politicians and the public are working on, especially in a pandemic when all eyes are on you. Multiply that by the number of people who needs this service and you'll see why housing first is actually a lot more complicated than just ""giving people housing."" The city can get around this problem by pre-purchasing larger apartment buildings and attaching the vouchers specifically to those units -- but this can also create equivalent public housing ""slums"" as people no longer have a choice in where to live. 

This is where emergency crisis response and permanent housing are not two equivalent solutions. You need both. Emergency shelter is designed to be the quick and dirty solution to keeping people from sleeping under a bridge. It is the emergency room, whereby housing vouchers are long-term rehabilitation. The problem is during a pandemic you have thousands of new patients... the public is going to care more about whether or not those folks are sleeping outside than if their long-term needs are being taken care of.  The city is getting more permanent housing with the CARES Act, but even the new money coming in is not nearly enough to give even a fraction of assistance to everyone who needs a permanent subsidy. Unfortunately, hotels are cheap, uncomplicated, and can deal with all people in need as a block instead of as individuals which, sadly, is how a lot of the public thinks of them.

They key is a multi-pronged approach. Permanent subsidy for people with the highest most intensive needs and seniors, temporary subsidies for those in the middle, and connecting people to friends and family and one-time cash assistance for those with the least intensive needs. Plus, it would be nice to have a way to get people in vouchers that no longer need them out and into market-rate housing... but that's a whole different story.

In the meantime, you still need to have a system in place for right now and to deal with the upcoming eviction crisis to provide people with a roof over the heads *immediately*. This is where a robust shelter system comes in. Unfortunately, you need to have the *exit* from homelessness be a well-oiled machine before you can start funneling money from your shelter system back into it... which sort of presents a catch-22 as a well-oiled machine takes a lot of money and a lot of maintenance. Anyway, homelessness is a *very* complex problem and there is no one-size-fits-all solution to solving it. It also needs the support of all other social systems too, education, criminal justice, healthcare, and homelessness, disparities in one affect disparities in all.",69,2021-04-22 01:50:48 UTC,"homeless, homelessness"

""LIVING HELL Lexington Terrace families must struggle daily to endure"" - January 1993

Seen from Martin Luther King Boulevard, the 11-story brick building at 734 W. Fayette St. in the Lexington Terrace public housing development appears to have been abandoned. Chilly January winds whistle through its broken doors and missing windows.

Yet 69 families live in the rundown, 110-unit, high-rise building in West Baltimore that one tenant described as ""a living hell.""

The families have a bunker mentality. They are survivors in the cruel game of life in Baltimore's public housing projects. They are confronted daily by armed drug dealers, discarded hypodermic syringes and empty crack cocaine vials. Antiquated heating and sewage systems make everyday living uncomfortable. Calls for maintenance go ignored for months.

First of all, homeless/working folk is a false dichotomy. You'd be surprised the number of people in shelters with jobs. You correctly alluded to the point that a minimum wage job in Baltimore City isn't enough money to pay rent... so raising the minimum wage would in fact benefit both working people and those experiencing homelessness as it would shift the burden of financing a person's stability from the government to employers. It is very possible to both raise the minimum wage and fund homelessness as raising the minimum wage doesn't directly use city funds. But I don't think that's the point you are making, so let me give you the reasons why providing for people experiencing homelessness is a good investment for the city overall from both a humanitarian and an economic perspective.

1) People tend to view those that are homeless as in a permanent state of desperation and helplessness. This isn't true, you're seeing people at their lowest of low... access to drug treatment, stability, mental healthcare, and common decency can do a lot to to make someone a productive member of society. The endgame of most homeless systems is to get them stabilized and back into the community, it's just that some have a longer journey than others.

2) Homelessness will ALWAYS cost the city money. Living outside is not great for your health so people will quickly wrack up a massive bill in emergency room costs. Plus, these people will need to go somewhere, they're not just going to vanish off the face of the planet. So they'll erect tent cities and panhandle on street corners... not great for a city's image and economic activity. So the city will need more policing because if you're not providing shelter, you need to manage encampments. Closing down an encampment just means you're constantly moving it somewhere else, or spreading people out. It becomes a game of wack-a-mole. This isn't free... DPW needs to clean up encampment areas and the police need to constantly be kicking people out of private property. Plus it disincentives economic activity in the area as people are hesitant to move, open businesses, and spend money in Baltimore if there is extreme amounts of vagrancy. This directly affects working folks. If you think MLK boulevard is bad, you should check out the west coast where the problem has gone completely out of control. You can throw everyone in jail, but paying for incarceration is WAY more expensive than shelter. Not to mention the judicial costs and human rights conversations. When you get down to it, the city's actions are probably the cheapest way to deal with homelessness (besides financing more permanent housing, but I already described the pitfalls and complexities of that above).

3) I may be naive, but I think most citizens of Baltimore City genuinely care about the welfare of it's most vulnerable citizens. Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. These are our friends, neighbors, family, and fellow Baltimoreans.

That said, I think you are right that better roads and public transportation help the housed and homeless alike and I do agree that greater investment in infrastructure is desperately needed. But it cannot be at the expense of homeless services. There is no escaping the cost of extreme poverty on a city, so you might as well do the humane thing and provide support. That said... is the hotel the most humane thing... absolutely not, but it is a piece in a multifaceted system. It's hard to justify expensive permanent housing when you can't even provide a basic roof over someone's head, and to reiterate, there just isn't enough shelter space (especially shelter space that allows for people to maintain social distancing).

There are other overinflated budgets that should draw your ire for disinvestment before you come after homelessness (***cough, cough, policing***) but that's a whole other story.",8,2021-04-22 12:17:53 UTC,"homeless, homelessness"

It's easier to help people in stable situations and it's easier for people in stable situations to change and to want to change.

I went to both a kinda poor school (lots of families on welfare, most kids got free or reduced price lunch) and also a kinda rich school (lotsa kids who lived in mansions, luxury cars etc) and the kids at the rich school were much bigger bullies than the ones at the poor school. 

And about trash, are you sure people throw trash all over the place when they actually have a place to throw it and it gets picked up? If the dumpster is full then lotsa people are gonna litter rather than letting it stay inside their apartment. I think also a big thing is how well places are taken care of. If a place isn't maintained and nothing gets fixed, tenants aren't going to care either, but if it's unkept most people will make more of an effort. Baltimore City obviously has a really bad track record of upkeep for public housing and I think poverty concentration isn't good, but everything else isn't enough either when of extremely low income people, there is only subsidized housing available for 30% of those households.",1,2021-04-23 05:23:26 UTC,"homeless, homelessness"

These are often called rapid-exits for people who recently became homeless. There is also eviction prevention for people at risk of becoming homeless that can keep them out of the shelter system altogether.  That can be in the form of security deposits, finding single room rentals, money for travel, and yes, connection to friends and family. 

Really, it is a holistic problem-solving approach that is based on trying to figure out what an individual's unique barriers are to housing and trying to solve them, rather than shoving people into one-size-fits all programmatic approach. So, let's say someone has an income, but no savings, maybe they can find a rental unit on their own and just need a security deposit. Maybe they have a sibling in Nebraska who is willing to take them in and they just need money for a bus ticket. Maybe they need mediation with an estranged relative... Or maybe they're in a panic because everything is crashing down that they haven't taken the time to regroup and think about their options. Most providers will just say ""put your name on this waitlist for housing"" and be patient, rather than helping you problem-solve your unique situation. 

The goal is not that these folks will live with a family member permanently, but even a week with your sister is a week out of shelters and another week to regroup and make a longer-term plan. Sometimes, yes, it's having someone sit you down and help you make an uncomfortable phone call. It probably won't work for most, but even if it works for 5% of the homeless population, the return on investment is huge.

It is part of acknowledging that there will never be enough money in a community to provide rental assistance for everyone, so identifying those who don't need it and finding creative solutions (even creative temporary solutions) to keep them out of the shelter system is really important. I'll acknowledge it is a new way of thinking about social support systems, but it is a trend that is catching on and a lot of cities are implementing rapid exits and prevention / diversion strategies successfully.",6,2021-04-22 16:07:39 UTC,homeless

What truly annoys me is when people live in a bubble and then insist that everyone else either exists according to their bubble or they are somehow inferior to them. That mindset is ridiculous and creates barriers to various cultures getting to learn about one another.

I'm all for proper mental institutions where people can have what they need to live as best a life as can be with medications if necessary somewhere clean and safe all those things.  Pretty much a hospital that's there for their needs.  

For drug addicts they can be the same place until they can get off the drugs but this thing about letting people just roam the streets or nod off all wherever isn't going to work.  

Honestly, in this city are the shelters full?  If not then they need to be fully utilized before other means come about.  Again with them being cleaned regularly and made safe from thieves and all that but the problem is in the how to make that happen?

People that staff such facilities need to be paid after all and paid good money to deal with the challenges they would face in such a place.  They would also have to be properly vetted to minimize abuse to the vulnerable residents as well and to make sure they aren't enabling bad behavior as well.

>Baltimore will continue housing about 500 homeless residents in hotel rooms at least through June, extending a program designed to prevent the spread of COVID-19, even though it has not yet applied for $35 million in federal money that would pay for it. 

These hotels are probably not 5 star rated and the view may not be as nice as the Canton waterfront. However, it would seem to be much better than living in a tent long term. The hotels not only provide shelter and safety, but electricity, running water, bathrooms, heat, A/C, change of towels and bed linen and probably cable TV. 

It seems that there is a short term solution already in place for the few tents that have sprung up in Canton as well as longer term solutions that are being planned.

Im not sure what idealized utopian society your talking about. 
 Making an effort to reduce begging is certainly not going to rid us of the problem. There have always been and always will be beggars, their numbers fluctuate. One reason for the current increase is our severe opioid problem and these fine folks aren‚Äôt planning their next meal or getting some cash togeather for a cheap motel. These individuals are making money to score so they can get up and do the same exact thing tomorrow. They come from all over the state when the dope is plentiful, cheap, and strong, and reducing their numbers is what I‚Äôm talking about. Some people haven‚Äôt come to the conclusion that they themselves are a contributing factor to the problem and helping them understand this could make a difference. We have no idea how much of a difference until we try, not trying dosent work, and here we are. 
 There are currently programs in place to feed and shelter the homeless but the junkies, IMO, are the main problem. Until we‚Äôre ready to have a real, adult conversation about slowing down the opioid issue, we could try an alternate route. OP‚Äôs post is about reducing the number of panhandlers, I‚Äôm not here to save the world. One thing I know to be tru, if you take crackers to the park sooner or later you‚Äôll wind up covered in bird shit.

First, 99% of the shelters & assistance places have (or refer to) case managers and social workers to provide that long-term assistance.  I don't know any place except churches that say ""here's a meal now leave.""  
   
Second, giving $5 to a homeless person will not help him get a doctor's appointment or a mailing address.  Healthcare for the Homeless provides both of those things.  There are things that are nearly impossible to do with small cash gifts, such as put down a security deposit on an apartment.       
   
If you give $5 to a homeless person standing on Conway, it's a 35 minute walk or 20 minute bus ride to the nearest real grocery store.  Instead, they are likely going to get food at 711 or a corner store, thus spending the money relatively ineffectively.  Even if they walk there, they are limited by inability to cook anything.  For $5, Our Daily Bread can feed 5 people real hot meals.  
  
Not to mention that same situation but applied to buying shoes and clothing downtown.  
    
Not to mention, every homeless person in Baltimore knows these things and is getting their food/shelter/supplies from charities, so literally 100% of your cash donation is ""fun money"" to them: snack food, cigs, alcohol, etc.  Absolutely none of it will be used in any helpful manner.  You do literally nothing except perhaps upkeep an addiction with your donation.",4,2018-01-31 06:04:28 UTC,homeless

Nearly every one of my homeless patients has an uncanny ability to be intoxicated and unable to answer questions in triage or will answer positively to COVID screening questions and becomes unable to get a hallway or waiting room spot because they're a risk for the virus.

Then they get stuck in the stretcher/wheelchair for 3 hours and get the hospital put on reroute because the safety protocol is backing everything up like crazy.

Not to mention the staffing limitations of BCFD EMS and how much of a burden that puts to take an ambulance out for an hour plus for people sleeping in the wrong places.

They panhandle, but they are respectful, helpful, quiet, they clean up their area. It's really a dream.

When we go out to eat, we make sure to bring something back for them.

We're going to be leaving the area soon, so I told one of them that we wanted to put together a package with stuff for them before we leave and I asked what would be most helpful.

His response... keeping in mind, we're in fall and winter is coming up, so needs will change with the seasons:

* any kind of clothes, especially warm socks (READ MY NOTE DOWN BELOW)

* blankets

* warm jackets

* hygiene products (soap, shampoo, toothpaste, etc)

* he mentioned he had a girlfriend, and that feminine hygiene products would be particularly useful for her

**IMPORTANT:** A note on warm socks. I used to run an outdoor fitness group, so staying warm outdoors in winter was super important to me and I did a bunch of research.

When looking for warm socks, most people select something by feel: Something that feels thick and fuzzy.

This is a mistake.

A lot of those (a majority, I would say) are made of cotton, which is horrible for warmth, because it retains moisture and saps heat from the wearer.

For warm socks, the best thing is natural wool. I know that's expensive, about $10 - $12 per pair at a place like TJ Maxx or Marshalls.

So the next best alternative is a synthetic like acrylic, polyester or nylon.

These type of socks are commonly sold under brand names like Heat Holders. They are both thick and warm. The only downside is that they stink to high heaven after a wearing, whereas wool won't.

I know it's going to feel really silly to be in the sock aisle and have to look at every single sock and find the label that indicates the type of material and then start comparing one with 65% acrylic, 30% polyester and 5% nylon against another with some other distribution, but if you actually care, take the time to do it.

&nbsp;

**In summary:**

**Cotton socks are a big waste of money for people who need to stay warm outdoors. Get wool (expensive) or synthetic (cheaper) only.**

Homeless shelters can be sponsored and more easily set up in cheaper areas of the city. 

Furthermore, in my experience, most homeless and underserved people do not apply for economic assistance or similar programs such as Medicaid at the city or state office. It is often done with the assistance of social workers through a third-party at their location.

End the regulations that cause homelessness. If you can rent a room for $10 per night there will most likely be no involuntary homelessness because anyone can beg and make $10 per day for housing and $10 per day for food. The rooms might look something like this:

https://asv2014.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/room-asv-corbetthall1.png

Not very much space, but lightyears ahead of living on the street. The above room would be illegal to rent out in Baltimore and in most American cities as far as I know.

2. End the federal reserve. Asset prices(including housing) are bid way way up to due to a 7 year period of 0% interest rates.

All veterans suffering from severe PTSD, for example, could be housed in the same area for easier treatment and, hopefully, support. Obviously people aren't always going to fit into neat little descriptions of why they are homeless but I think you can group them into people who are facing similar problems. Then if you need to do PTSD counseling you can have someone go to a single location and potentially treat a lot more people. I'm not sure a one size fits all community is as effective since there are going to be a LARGE number of mental issues facing the homeless.

Let's retrofit existing rowhomes to meet the needs of those who would live there. This could vary wildly using the aforementioned strategy. Once again, I'm not sure a one size fits all strategy will work and would defer that to people who know better. But it's very plausible that certain home designs/layouts could help mitigate certain issues.

Also, I think intermingling ""low risk"" people in mixed income areas could be effective. Basically graduating them out of the aforementioned into something more normal with the idea being to eventually get them independent again and out of the system entirely.",2,2017-08-24 16:58:47 UTC,homeless

Homeless people are scared shitless of upstanding homeowners/renters simply because they know that it only takes one call from one of you to the police to have them arrested and then brought up on any outstanding warrants. More often than not, homeless folks are arrested and charged with misdemeanors but never show up for their trial date. As a result, depending on the crime, a bench warrant can be issued. In my experience, a direct confrontation works out in the long run because it keeps you from having to testify about something stupid they might have done on your property like petty vandalism or lewd and lascivious behavior. 

I think most other folks on this subreddit will disagree with my thoughts on this but frankly after having dealt with an inordinate number of the homeless while living in Baltimore, Frederick, and now Washington DC, I can assure you that it is much simpler to handle things yourself unless you believe you truly need law enforcement to do it. More often than not, homeless people are actually incredibly understanding because they don't want to piss off the people who look the other way when they're staying somewhere illegally.

Additionally, if you feel unsafe in your home or believe that they may be using narcotics in your alley, I would advise you to purchase a shotgun. While this may sound extreme, when you have a community of drug using individuals using an area as a safe haven, that area can become the site of home invasions, burglaries, and car break-ins. In scenarios like this, you are within your rights to use your weapon as a standoff measure. Once you squeeze the trigger, things change legally but it's more likely that you'll never need to pick the gun up at all.


*edit* Let me be clear, a shotgun can be used as a standoff measure within the boundaries of your own property, not on the sidewalk or anywhere beyond your official property lines.

[Hostile architecture](http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/unpleasant-design-hostile-urban-architecture/) is an increasingly common facet of urban life. It doesn't solve the problems underlying homelessness but it does increase the security and protect the investment of property owners who use it.

(Tiny rant here) Homelessness is uncomfortable. It makes non-homeless people feel gross inside - gross because we can't do much about it in the grand scheme of things (volunteering at a soup kitchen doesn't put 10,000 people to work and provide affordable, non-slum housing) and gross because we don't really, truly want to be around it - it's uncouth to say but it's reality.

I'm not going to lie, homeless people make me feel unsafe. Yes, there are thousands of homeless people in Baltimore and many of them are in the boat I was in about six years ago - a job loss, a car breaks down, bills overwhelm, and boom you're on the street. I've been there, literally. But there are those like the guy I see very frequently that stands and screams at women passing by. Screams, full on top of his lungs, horrible obscenities. He's absolutely mentally ill, there's no question about it. But knowing that doesn't make me any less afraid that he's going to end up in jail for raping or murdering someone.

I wish there was a solution. But it's a pipe dream to think that any of the standard platitudes about solving homelessness (volunteer, elect different city officials, speak out to the city council, etc etc) are either doable in a realistic manner or that I'm personally going to be impactful on them. In the meantime, I feel like a monster for hoping I don't have to see or interact with them. I feel like a monster because I was there and I pulled myself out of the pit and I can't do anything to help them (or more honestly, probably won't do anything) and what does that say about me.",23,2017-08-20 16:55:32 UTC,"homeless, homelessness, soup kitchen"

Those with homes feel uncomfortable about having the homeless around, but since they can't do much about the ""homeless"" they do something about the ""around.""

Removing the homeless from a given area increases the public safety and value of that community. That increases incoming residents which brings jobs and raises property values.

More jobs and more property value means higher tax revenue for the community, some of which hopefully goes to help the ""homeless"" part of that statement.

I don't want anyone to be relegated to a tent city, but if there was a way to reduce the negative impact of homelessness on the people who aren't homeless (which, again, is an uncomfortable thing to want) that could hopefully create a ""rising tide lifts all boats"" scenario where the homeless are ultimately helped.

While  former  patients  initially  could  rely  on  receiving  treatments  from  these  centers  at  first,  funding  for  them  from  the  federal  government  lasted  less  than  five  years.    Without  federal  support,  states  could  not  fund  these  centers  which  were  vital  to  the  health  of  their  patients.  Many  discharged  patients  were  not  prepared  for  life  without  full-time  supervision  and  could  not  effectively  take  care  of  themselves.  Drugs alone could not effectively treat mental  health  issues,  which  caused  many  former  state hospital patients to become homeless (Lyons 1984). While the Reagan administration didn‚Äôt start the contemporary homelessness problem, it drastically contributed to it by passing legislation that made it worse. The administration passed a law that that ended  involuntary  hospitalization  yet  discarded  a  proposed  law  that  would  have  resumed  funding  for  community  health  centers,  releasing  people  without giving them access to the care they need to function normally in society (Roberts 2013). Congress also decreased funding to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for low income housing, meaning that cities could not afford  to  maintain  or  expand  their  public  housing  for low income individuals and families. These decisions in the 1980s contributed to the rationale for a change in policy that ultimately led to the demolition of public housing in the 1990s, leaving some former residents homeless (Griffin 2015).

So there's that.  

But even for the vacants that are defined by simply being vacant,  there's the question of who owns them now. The article talks about community land trusts,  but doesn't really touch on how a CLT would acquire the properties.  Would they be expropriated?  Bought out from the current owner? I'm willing to bet that the city's options are limited to knowing down condemned building or putting a line on the properties for property taxes owed.  

Once they are acquired,  who's going to pay to fix them up to a livable state? Who's going to define what a livable state looks like from unit to unit? 

Or are we just talking about squatting? I'd hazard a guess that many people are already just doing this,  but that comes with it's own liabilities for the city to deal with.   

The housing first model has shown a lot of success in reducing homeless (though not nessisaraly on reducing poverty)  but it doesn't involve putting people into substandard housing (at least not on paper, that's a whole other topic).  It involves investing in governments low income housing while also working to move people into affordable market units and providing wrap-around support once they've moved in to stabilize people in their units.  It's not as simple as moving the homeless into vacants.

I'm talking pry off the plywood door and have a view of the third floor. A homeless person would fair better in the streets than they would among the moldy water damage and rusty nails. Not to mention the walls that might cave in. 

In order to make these homes livable, by current standards, it would require total rehab. Construction costs about $85 to $135 per square foot so a very small row house (say 600 square feet) would cost *minimally* $51k. It would be more cost effective to knock down one city block and and create a building for the homeless people.

These homes will likely stay this way until torn down as the city tried to give the properties away (SCOPE properties) and still not many takers. Most of people can't afford the rehab. The people who can afford to rehab don't want live there. 

City areas turn around one of two ways. They get torn down and rebuilt as commercial areas/high-rise apartments, or an investor comes around and rebuilds/rehabs an entire block, usually building off the edge of an okay area. But with little hope of a better job market, not may are willing to invest Baltimore.

Edit: Even if they could give these homes away (which would be nice because it would suck to see these beautiful old homes torn down) there is still the pesky matter of ground rent.

Salt Lake City (I believe) has virtually ended homelessness by putting homeless people up in housing.  I don't remember all the details but I believe it free for a year while they get on their feet.  It has reduced what the city has had to spend both for homeless people and in the needless jailing of homeless individuals. 

A family member wound up doing several years in prison.  He was homeless and squatting in a vacant building.  He lit a fire to keep warm, him and some of the other squatters.  Well, of course the fire spread, the whole thing came down and he was sent to prison over it.  Stuff like this can be avoided if something is done

This was a guy who apparently mistook a street manhole cover for a sidewalk manhole cover and was run over by a bus driver who couldn't see him through the steam from the sewer.

The most depressing part is this:

>Anthony said street team members talked with four men and one woman in the same area where the fatal collision happened Thursday night. They all declined services. If an individual doesn‚Äôt have shelter, Anthony said often times they will use manhole covers as tool to keep warm.

Even when offered a warm place to sleep, they decline. I've worked EMS in a place with a significant homeless population, and it's difficult to get people inside during the cold months (or the warm months, for that matter). Most shelters and public housing require an abstention from drug and alcohol use, which many homeless are not willing to abide by. In my experience, 95+% of the chronically homeless are either mentally ill, drug addicted, or some combination thereof. Accidents like these are an inevitable result. 

And honestly, I'm not sure what to immediate steps could be taken to solve this problem. Aside from involuntary committal, there is no Constitutional means for forcing someone off of the street when they aren't an immediate threat to themselves or someone else. It sucks to see homeless people die from things like exposure, random violence, vehicle accidents, etc. every year. But I'm not sure if most of even the most progressive housing measures would be enough to manage the huge mental illness and addiction problems we have. Putting someone in a house doesn't treat their schizophrenia or their heroin addiction.

This means that their business model is sustainable.

Wasn't trying to present it as an amazing program. The original post seemed to indicate an ignorance to the initiative, which turned out not to be the case (""I'm well aware of that""). I have no idea about the program's performance, but it does address a wider group than just one kid.

I was legitimatly asking if the squeegee issue was one of the biggest problems in Baltimore, since people are so passionate about it despite seeming somewhat less important compared to other issues. Issues, which I might add, are connected to the squeegee problem (like poor school quality, lack of economic opportunities in many communities, other social services or lack there of, etc.). All I got was downvoted, so I'm still confused as to whether it is a major issue to be tackled or not. 

I don't think shes done ""absolutely nothing"". I think what she has done is really underwhelming. Though, her efforts towards homelessness seem pretty good, from what I understand (I won't pretend to know much about this, either).

One issue is that I don't think mayors have much control over crime. The mayor can hire and fire the commissioner, but not much else, since its a state agency. And consider that crime decreases in the 1990s and 2000s have been attributed to declines in unwanted pregnancies from years before and other circumstances beyond mayoral or police control. Here is an interesting article, and an interesting quote. https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/what-caused-the-crime-decline/477408/ 

""But other policing tactics appeared to have little impact, even in New York City, which led the innovative wave in the early  ‚Äô90s. Mayor Rudy Giuliani and NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton credit their broken-windows-style reforms for crime‚Äôs sharp decline after taking office in 1994. But scholars are quick to note the trend actually began in 1990""

I think its human nature to place blame. But the mayor I don't think is responsible for crime waves, and has little control in stopping it. 

I agree the squeegee program is not something to write home about, but is there really anything else to be done about them? It would be silly to arrest them. Not sure what other alternatives there are.

TLDR; Im not sure if the squeegee problem is a huge deal. Is it? (legit question). I dont think a mayor has as much control over broader issues than we think a mayor does. ",1,2018-03-15 14:25:59 UTC,"homeless, homelessness"

It's an easy cop out to just demonize the poor and say they're all con-men trying to game the welfare system for drugs. I'm not saying that doesn't happen, it does, but not nearly as much as you'd think. To just write the homeless off as lazy bastards that just want to milk government assistance is what people do when they themselves are too lazy to analyze the problem and think critically to understand root causes. In addition, that misunderstanding wont prompt the response necessary to help people, it just leads to the conclusion that we should jail the homeless, which doesn't help the individual and costs taxpayers much much more than leaving them on the street. No one wins in that scenario.  

Nobody want to be homeless, especially not in this town. [20 to 25% of the homeless population in the United States suffers from some form of severe mental illness.](http://www.nationalhomeless.org/factsheets/Mental_Illness.pdf) It's importatnt to diferentiate chronic homelessness from acute homelessness (everyone gets down on their luck once in a while, but most of us have the abiltiy to take measures to fix our situation 
That is part of the reason that you may [see the same people over and over again](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/27/mental-health-homeless-series/14255283/), even if they're jailed, they still don't have the tools or capabilities to repair their situation once the are released. 

Data from research conducted in the past five years indicates that:

‚Ä¢ About 30% of people who are chronically homeless have mental health conditions.

‚Ä¢ About 50% have co-occurring substance use problems.
According to analyses of data from the 1996 NSHAPCxiv:

‚Ä¢ Over 60% of people who are chronically homelessness have experienced lifetime mental
health problems

‚Ä¢ Over 80% have experienced lifetime alcohol and/or drug problems

It's no coincidence that the homeless population skyrocketed around the same time that Reagan started shutting down the residential treatment facilities for mental illness. There was a similar spike around the time haldol and other neuroleptics were developed -- you don't need to house a schizophrenic if there's a pill that can reduce/eliminate their hallucinations and delusions. Never mind the remaining cognitive impairment and thought disturbance! Just get them back out on the street so we can shut down this costly mental health facility and replace it with a medication distribution center. 

A friend of mine who had a psychotic break (not schizophrenia, but similar psychotic symptoms) told me that it was like suddenly walking into a world that was infinitely more complex and confusing than the one he used to occupy. He said it was like a transition from a simple, monastic life to a dystopian culture full of hierarchies and procedures wtih which he had only the dimmest familiarity. We took care of him through that time, but it was hard. He just didn't understand basic stuff. I made a beef stew with biscuits on top of it one night, and I served him a plate full of it, and he just mushed it up into a big mess and said he didn't know how to eat it. I had to serve a new plate and separate the beef from the potatoes from the biscuits and so on, and then he ate each component separately. I served the same meal to him when he wasn't psychotic anymore, and he had no problem at all. 

I guess the point is that mental illness can really disrupt your functioning and make anything but the simplest of transactions and interactions completely mystifying. Hence, panhandling and then walking into a McDonalds is something people with psychosis can manage. Going to a shelter is confusing -- they have to talk to a bunch of people, often including a mental health specialist. People with psychotic disorders (and people in general, really) can have some really paranoid ideas about mental health workers. 

It's not as simple as just perceiving and understanding the world as a person who isn't homeless perceives it. The world is very different for a homeless person -- sometimes because they're mentally ill, and sometimes just because they're homeless.",17,2015-07-10 10:32:37 UTC,homeless

What the fuck?  Helping Up Mission is one of the shelters people refuse to enter until code blue.  They have empty fucking beds until 4pm every day because you enter through the fucking church into (I've been told) a prison-like setting, only to get the hard-sell on Christianity and their 12-Step substance abuse program.  You can't really stay there more than a few days without entering their ""treatment"" program which is RELIGION-BASED.  Fml, I'm so stuck on this.  Can't we get ANY housing-first models that don't just involve churches pushing their personal views on people?  
   
Also can I just say of-fucking-course?  Of fucking course Catholic Charities came in to see if there were any ""eligible families"" they could ~~cream~~ save from the place, and of course they did this under their Fresh Start banner, didn't tell anyone who they were, and tried to drug test everyone.  
 
(Creaming being the practice of charities taking only the easiest/most media-ready cases to work on so they can show amazing results to funders.  Fresh Start is a great example of a creaming organization.  They will only take the most promising cases with photogenic kids who can keep that sweet donation money rolling.  Note that I don't blame them for doing this at all, these are real people they help, but to come in and drug test to see who's worthy is despicable in this case.)

Oh just shut the fuck up.  People are moving out of Baltimore because it's just not worth the constant stress and mental pain.  Upper-middle people moving because there were 4 homeless people on their corner every day = Baltimore doesn't keep moving forward.  That sweet tax money needs to flow if we are going to keep funding shelters and have huge projects succeed.   There needs to be a perceived quality of life.  Does everyone think it's some kind of accident that the most bougie areas are the most isolated?  Why do we think Fed and Harbor East are so much more expensive than Mt Vernon and Downtown?  
   
Though I'm actually fully FOR tent cities.  I'd rather Bruce (one of my corner regs) have a covered place to chill out that's just slightly off the main track.  Usually he's just chillin but wouldn't he like to chill in a spot where people aren't literally stepping on him?  And wouldn't everyone prefer that there be unsightly tent cities rather than individual people hanging out all day on the street?  People who live/work in Baltimore know what's up, there's no point pretending.  But tents are way better than just sleeping on the sidewalk...

I think what you want to do is great and I hope it works out for you. You seem like a great parent. 

That being said, I think the problem you'll face is finding a charity that will take younger volunteers. It may be a liability issue. I'll give you a list of trusted providers that I can vouch for:

* Back on my feet Baltimore. If you guys are athletic - or want to be - Back on my feet helps homeless people change their lives by training them to run. Volunteers run with them to show them that we care. Also, endorphins do everyone good. My sister and I volunteer and I can't recall any age requirements: http://baltimore.backonmyfeet.org/

* Our Daily Bread Employment Center: Our Daily Bread is a place where homeless people can go for a hot meal, training programs, and other resources such as shelters. This place is operated by Catholic Charities so if they don't take minor volunteers, they'd definitely know who does: http://www.catholiccharities-md.org/our-daily-bread/

* Helping Up Mission: https://helpingupmission.org/

* Esperanza Center: http://www.catholiccharities-md.org/immigrants/

Lastly, you can call United Way's call center. They connect people in need to various resources. They would be able to help your search. Call 211.",9,2015-07-13 15:35:36 UTC,homeless

I have mixed feelings about Helping Up Mission, because they require people who use their shelter to attend religious services.  

Maryland Food Bank is another good organization.  It's not direct client services, but they feed A LOT of people and can always use the help. 

You may also consider making monetary donations in their name and talking about why.  Healthcare for the Homeless does excellent work.

Taking kids down to a soup kitchen isn't going to change their behavior.  Parenting is  24/7 job.  Your children's behavior is a direct result of the behavior you exhibit around them, to them.  

Perhaps you should reflect on how you go about solving parenting issues, how you talk to your children, how you talk to your spouse, how you treat others and see if there are some things that you're unknowingly instilling in them?  Do you make frivolous purchases?  Do you waste food?  Have you taught them to be polite and vocally thank you for things?  **Do you have them do chores?**  The best way to instill the value of money to kids is to have them work for the things they get, imo.  And if they don't want to work/help around the house, then they don't get anything, possibly punished.  Its not a hard concept, but it is hard to enforce.  

Far too often it seems people are just looking for a way to feel good about themselves ^(like the vocal cause-of-the-week downtowners on this sub)  rather than actually make a difference.  Sometimes it does more harm than it does good (extreme liberalism).",5,2015-07-13 16:49:40 UTC,soup kitchen

They also said that many of the people that are chronically homeless, want to live on the street. Some people have mental illness or drug problems where they feel more comfortable in a tent city under 83 than they would in an apartment.

But one of the biggest things they mentioned was that people get used to begging at intersections instead of using resources that the Homeless Outreach Team can connect them with, so they just keep doing what they are doing.

Keeping foster kids from becoming homeless,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/3zyane/keeping_foster_kids_from_becoming_homeless/,2016-01-07 23:50:25 UTC,"I worked with foster kids in Baltimore for a couple of years and still interact with many in my new capacity.  I just want to give my two cents on this issue.

First, it is important to remember that each kid is different and there cookie cutter approaches usually do not work without some individualization of services.

Foster children in a foster home have a support system which some choose to utilize and others do not.  This includes foster families (I will be the first to admit there are shitty ones but there are some really good ones).  The Department of social services, which think about them what you will, but they provide many services to youth such as medical insurance, grants, funding, free college education until they are 21, a free laptop, and many other things that you just have to seek out.  They provide job training courses, seminars, summer employment through YouthWorks and services such as rental assistance and furniture.  They also provide an independent living program which youth can choose to enter where most of their rent is paid, they just need to either be a full time student, have full time employment, or be part time in each.  They must abide by rules such as no drug use, illegal activities, and overnight visitors are sometimes restricted depending on the organization.

Still there is a HUGE number of youth in Baltimore who age out and have no one and nothing and end up being homeless.  It is sad.  People (including many friends of mine) are actively trying to fix it.  One of the biggest hindrances imo is the attitude of youth that they do not need assistance, which leads to not seeking out help, which leads to them freaking out 2 months before they turn 21 because they finally realize that all of these services disappear.  

Social workers actively try to engage youth in various services and programs, but are unsuccessful due to lack of cooperation from the youth, their foster families, or both.  I just wanted to provide a little bit of insight. ",2,2016-01-08 16:02:11 UTC,homeless

Unless it‚Äôs the MOMA or smithsonian and has the capacity to really bring in top notch stuff fairly regularly, it‚Äôs not gonna be a good investment.

I‚Äôm not proposing turning Barnes and noble into some mall- I‚Äôm strongly against the idea.

It absolutely shouldn‚Äôt be retail stores and I fully agree on that. We have parks downtown, like the Holocaust memorial park. The issue with it is that it‚Äôs where all the addicts and homeless go, which makes people avoid the area. So just putting empty space there would yield the same result.

In my opinion, this is a situation where you don't want to play nice. You have a trespasser on your hands. This is a major safety hazard for you and your fellow tenants. What if they have a medical emergency in your foyer? What if they decide to get belligerent with you when you come home or leave? What if they attack you?

I believe this for 911 calls. That is, I think if you call with something less urgent they will know to process it as a 311 ticket. However, I suspect some calls made to 311 about nuisance issues could be getting missed.‚Äú

Whether you call through 311 or 911 the call directly goes to the Police Radio dispatcher to get sent out. All the calls go to one ‚Äúboard‚Äù as it‚Äôs called. The only way for police to know if it came through 311 is to look through their computer (if they have one) on the CAD notes and somehwere within the call it will state it. So the calls that are dispatched out in the radio aren‚Äôt dispatched as ‚Äúwe have a 311 call for XYZ‚Äù. The calls aren‚Äôt differentiated like that. So just because you‚Äôre calling through 311 doesn‚Äôt mean that you will get a slower response time. In terms of priority calls, a disorderly (homeless person hanging around where they shouldn‚Äôt) is a very low priority. As higher priority calls come in those get dispatched first. 

911 is used for real life threatening emergencies. 311 is if you‚Äôre experiencing a non life threatening emergency. so that if someone who needs life threatening assistance can 911 and won‚Äôt be waiting to speak to an operator.",-1,2023-04-03 23:09:44 UTC,homeless

It's happened several times now when sitting at a red and a panhandler passes by, they stop and ask and my usual smile and head shake and ""no cash, sorry"" that usually gets them to move on when I drive my car gets an incredibly aggressive response when I'm driving his car.

I don't usually feel like explaining that it isn't really my car - once I was even on the phone and they just got belligerent when I don't respond to their WWJD comments with relenting and cash so they start swearing at me. I usually have my kids in the car.

Yes, it's a symptom of Leftist policies.  Everyone wants a handout, but we have plenty of unfilled jobs.

I was homeless in Baltimore.  I was homeless for less than 6 months before I got into a program with communal housing.  Then less than two years through transition programs, school, and now I'm a success story.

There is so much waste and abuse, it's appalling.

There is a known history of states busing their transient population to cities across California.

Here is an example: http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/Nevada-Settles-Homeless-Dumping-Lawsuit-369736411.html

Likewise, cities across that state (and across the country) have participated in the same. The practice is known as ""Homeless Dumping"", and is nothing new.

There are shelters with open beds nearly every day.  (I've had to call for people before- it was NOT hard to find a shelter)   The caveat being that you can't show up high, and you likely have to... ya know... make progress on your shit if you want to stay there longer-term.  
   
The homeless can get food stamps ($200/month) and there are a TON of pantries and soup kitchens around the city.  Seriously tons.  
  
You've also got Healthcare for the Homeless.  PS most of these places are giving out bus tokens so you can get from one to the other as-needed.  They all hand out toiletries, socks, whatever.   
  
So.... food, shelter, and transit is covered..... your money 100% goes to feed the addiction.  Not half, not ""some,"" it is nearly 100% being spent on drugs/alcohol.   It. Does. Not. Help. At. All.   They'll never be able to save enough dollar bills to put a deposit on an apartment or whatever you think they're doing with it.  There's no utility in a few dollars here and there.  It's not POSSIBLE to use it effectively.  The only thing that's effective is accepting REAL help from community organizations who will hit you with a barrage of resources to get on your feet.  **The real help is all FREE as well.  It almost never costs money to get help.**  
  
If you give a dollar every day while walking to work, you may as well light it on fire.  After a year of walking the same route let me tell you the panhandlers have no idea who you are.  They aren't thankful.  They're just focused on getting that money to do what they need to do.

So I looked it up. Some shelters do charge money, especially for people who have been homeless for more than a few weeks.

Then I read Baltimore provides enough so they shouldn't need to pan handle. - Sure Baltimore provides plenty for the homeless who are sound of mind and able to patiently and civilly wait each night for a chance of food and shelter ( when the shelters aren't full) but a good many of homeless suffer greatly from mental health issues and have a huge deep seeded paranoia of shelters.

In any event I like to wear headphones as well and sadly people will still try to ask me for money anyway.  Just the same I am not giving them any money at all. 

As far as a city is concerned really that's all the more reason why we as private citizens shouldn't be going for it at all.  You aren't going to tell me in a city that you are hungry when there is food all over the place that's quite cheap. I can easily get several packs of ramen noodles for one dollar and there are plenty of food banks and churches that offer food. 

Housing is another beast because that's a whole lot more expensive but I honestly feel that what it would cost to house each homeless person in Baltimore would be worth it if it means a better reputation for the city.  Instead of giving millions of dollars to rich people invest in this for the city and when it's more attractive those people will come without being bribed to do so.",2,2019-05-30 17:31:48 UTC,homeless

Journalism is dead, especially in Baltimore. 

If there were articles questioning the story, then it wouldn't be an article - it would be an opinion piece. At that point, the Baltimore Sun no longer is a journalistic operation, it's a blog that happens to be in possession of a printing press.

Journalism is reporting on the facts as they are known at the time. All reports - including from the BPD at the time - indicated that the actions were undertaken by a homeless individual. However, there were some (including immediate family) who doubted the veracity of that story. The Baltimore Sun did in fact report on that, thereby presenting the facts - accurately reporting on what they were known to be at the time, and presenting opinions of relevant parties.

As the available details have changed, the Baltimore Sun (and all other outlets) has continued to report on such. If you check their twitter accounts, you'll see that some reporters did question the story. However, Kevin Rector writing that they suspect the given narrative to be false is not their job. Their job is to report the facts on the ground, not their own opinion.

The irony is that you're saying ""journalism is dead"" when they followed the tenants of proper journalism - particularly with regard to [Journalistic objectivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalistic_objectivity).

1) Libel and slander are civil actions, not criminal. Thus, the state doesn't bring the charges, the victims do, and the victims here are panhandlers.

If they are professional panhandlers, they probably don't want any extra media attention lest their scheme be discovered.

2) You need to prove that your reputation was damaged, and frankly, transients don't have much of a reputation to begin with. What would their damages be? They aren't losing out on professional opportunities. Any social relationships they have aren't likely any worse.

As it turns out, it was blown out of proportion aka a big fat lie. Even when it comes out it was a lie, people will still say, ""Yeah, but I could totally see that happening in Baltimore, though.""

[That's the inspiration for the creation of this meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/x15b4q/iteam_bpd_investigates_discrepancies_in_extortion/), yes, with the prior context having been the ""panhandler murder"" wherein a middle-aged women was murdered and it was alleged that it was done by an aggressive panhandler.

At the time, there were frequent complaints in news media and on social media about aggressive panhandling. Note that this only slightly predates the present discourse surrounding squeegees - though that was becoming prominent [around the same time](https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/brmxdn/squeegeeing_is_merely_aggressive_panhandling/). Most commonly, complaints came from commuters typically along Pratt Street and MLK - especially as [the latter, at the time, was host a large contingent of the city's homeless population.](https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/7txbxm/what_is_being_done_about_the_homelesspanhandling/)

As it turned out, however, the story was false. [Here's the thread for that one.](https://old.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/a26tad/a_52yearold_woman_is_killed_after_rolling_down/)

Mayor's Statement

> BALTIMORE, MD. -- Like everyone in our city, state and across this nation, we mourned the senseless killing of Jacquelyn Smith. To now learn that family members staged this brutal killing is beyond belief and represents a double tragedy. They were responsible for taking Jacquelyn's life with unconscionable cruelty, and contrived to do so in our city under the guise of random violence, exploiting the legitimate fears of our residents. I commend our homicide detectives for their expert and tireless work in bringing those truly responsible to justice in this very troubling and sad case.

The only difference between Scott and the previous mayors is that Scott is also choosing to use Reddit to push his agenda.  

As far as the squeegee boy issue, I do not have any specific policy to preach but I am also not the mayor who should be able to at least acknowledge the problem and provide some semblance of a response.  That said, I do feel as though using police as a resource to enforce existing laws and force these panhandlers off primary intersections isn't that ridiculous of a position regardless of whether the hive-mind of reddit agrees.  The fact the ""boys"" position themselves at major intersections throughout the city (e.g. Pratt and President) commonly used by visitors only further solidifies the negative views held by non-city residents and hurts the local economy as a result.",-1,2020-12-22 21:13:48 UTC,panhandler

&#x200B;

\-Pace of life-slower, much more ""calmer"" for lack of a better word

&#x200B;

\-Drivers-terrible, just absolutely terribe! They drive here like either they have all the time in the world to get to wherever they are going, or drive like there's an impeding apocolyptic event and they are trying to get away from it. You'll see a range of driving styles in which they are either very passive, and try to be too nice, or manically aggressive. Drivers here will drive you figurtively and literally up the wall! Just wait  until it snows in the winter, then all hell breaks loose.

&#x200B;

\-General attitude- I think they are friendly and very non pretentious, rough around the edges. Baltimore reminds me a lot of a smaller version of Brooklyn or Queens.

&#x200B;

\-This city has a high tolerance for panhandlers, you'll see them a lot.

&#x200B;

spots are very walkable, especially downtown and South Baltimore, Fells Point, Canton, Locust Point, Hampden. Mass transit, well you're going to be disappointed.  You will also encounter very strong negative emotions towards mass transit and general urban development. The rural/urban divide is strong here. You'll meet city folks who will talk as if they just absolutely hate living in the city some will actively try to stop any and all urban development proposals. As a New Yorker, you'll be straching your head trying to figure out why they hate it so much and try so hard to stop or sabotage any attempts to improve the city, at the same time complain how terrible it is. But you'll also encounter a fierce pride for the city and region, so its very oxymoronic.

&#x200B;

Overall, Baltimore is a low key, laid back smaller version of Brooklyn or Queens, but with  very strong Southern overtones overlapping with a Northeastern, industrial, working class culture. It's a city of contrasts. It will make you feel extremely frustrated but also very proud because of its gritty, rough around the edge culture and history that is in many ways unique. Her people will frustrate you, but you'll probably make some of the best friends you'll have.

If you take all the ""hip"" neighborhoods in Baltimore combined (Fells Point, Fed Hill, Canton, Mt Vernon, Hampden, etc.), the scene is the equivalent of only Park Slope, or only Williamsburg.

People in Baltimore are more friendly and welcoming.  Fewer scenesters (because there are fewer scenes).

You probably won't have any interaction with police in Baltimore unless you are the victim of crime.  If you are white, the police will be fine.  If you're black, be careful.

Homeless people in Baltimore are more confined to street corner begging. I rarely see them walking the streets.

Public transit here sucks. Parking is probably about the same as New York. 

The biggest culture shock for me when I first moved to Baltimore was people's blase' attitudes towards renting apartments.  In New York, if you see an apartment you want, you go there that afternoon with check in hand and $12,000 in your bank account.  In Baltimore I feel like people barely even care to rent to you.

We have terrible mass transit. Like, abhorrently bad. Especially if you end up working in the county. Traffic is similar but Maryland drivers are probably the worst in the nation in regards to aggressiveness. I've seen some truly stupid behavior on the road. There are a lot of good restaurants in the city and good food to be had, that's a plus. Probably not quite as multi-cultural as NYC though. Baltimore natives can be pretty friendly, but you're going to have your fair share of assholes. I noticed when in New York that NYers are friendly and will strike up conversation with just about anyone, in Baltimore you'll usually get left alone. People don't really chit chat or try to talk to you for the most part. There are some truly destitute portions of the city where crime is rampant - and you want to avoid being alone at night in these areas at all costs. Some parts of Baltimore are pretty walkable so it depends on where you end up - some parts of this walkability banks on you walking through bad neighborhoods, so that's up to you. Lots of heroin addicts and opioid addicts in the city. You'll see them ""snoozing"" on park benches in weird positions at all times of the day. Lots of panhandlers and homeless. Avoid the ""squeegee boys"" at all costs.

A better comparison would be between the Federal Hill and Canton neighborhoods of Baltimore and the Hoboken/Jersey City (waterfront) neighborhoods of NJ. Both have a ton of bars/restaurants and a healthy mix of 20 somethings and families.

I moved from Harlem to Baltimore about 4 years ago and, in my opinion, the two cities are really nothing alike. Cost of living is the obvious difference in that its cheaper to buy a home in Bmore than it is to rent, whereas in NYC buying a home in neighborhoods closest to Manhattan (or a decent subway line) is reserved for those above a certain income threshold. 

As for the little things, parking sucks in the trendy areas of both cities. Both are noisy if you're near a train line (I lived above a freight line when I first moved to Bmore), both are easily walkable it really just depends on how far you're going. Public transit isn't even remotely comparable...for the most part owning a car in NYC is too much of a pain to be worth it (the parking tax will make this evenworse), Baltimore its a pain NOT to have one (I tried). As for panhandlers, in NYC they're underground, in Bmore they're out in the open...same thing, different place. With the exception of pizza, food in Baltimore is better (with a surprising amount of variety) and for the most part, cheaper. A night out in Fells Point will cost us $150 vs $300+ in NYC. The beer scene is significantly better here than in NYC, if thats your thing.

People here may not be aware of it but coming from D.C. I am very aware of it. D.C. is much more like New York than Baltimore is. As a native of there it really annoys me how what used to be my home was overrun by a number of folks that don't respect the local history or culture.  There isn't much integration just this idea of ha, ha ha, we're here now do everything our way.

This was something in common that I had with an elderly woman that grew up in Fells Point. Listening to her talk at a local book store it was quite entertaining to hear her tales of what once was and it sounded very much like stuff I've felt before.

Part of the lack of pretentiousness comes from being willing to work hard.  There is just a certain mentality that comes from that in contrast with someone that isn't used to that. 

As far as panhandlers are concerned there are a lot of them here and I really wish that was something that was addressed already.  

One thing about Baltimore is that people here do not like to cross at a crosswalk. They will walk right in front of a car as if they want to get hit to cross the street.

The law with respect to squeegee workers and panhandlers has not been enforced, as there are probably other higher priorities.

When Kweisi Mfume was a member of the Baltimore City Council (now US Congressional Representative for Maryland's 7th Congressional District), he passed legislation making this illegal. Mfume was in the Baltimore City Council from 1978 to the end of 1986, when he was elected to congress. So this law has been around for at least 36 years.

>U.S. Rep. Kweisi Mfume represents West Baltimore in Congress and dealt with with the emergence of squeegee workers as a City Council member in the 1980s. Mfume said he was sickened by Thursday‚Äôs shooting and stressed the consequences to public safety if the city doesn‚Äôt find ways to clear squeegee workers, panhandlers and prostitutes from street corners.  
  
‚ÄúThe issue here is whether or not children are going to dictate the rules that adults have to live under, or whether there‚Äôs going to be a meeting of the minds here,‚Äù Mfume said.  
  
Mfume recounted being accosted by squeegee workers on multiple occasions and said many in their number today are ‚Äúa completely different group‚Äù from when he was a city official.  
  
At the time, Mfume said the city council was able to pass legislation to get squeegee workers, panhandlers and prostitutes off the streets. The bill was initially opposed by all Black members of the council, he said, but ultimately found overwhelming support after it was re-geared to focus on support and reform, not criminalization.

Depends on the day of the week, the weather, how many other people are out panhandling, and if they run into any generous people. Very few people actually give bills, so you make anywhere from $1 to (if they get super lucky) $20 in a day. In a day. There are days where people work the lane the entire day and make a dollar. it's a shitty, unreliable way to make money and almost everyone who does it hates it. There are far more $1 days than not.

>Everyone please, don't give money to them. Direct them to a shelter, Social Security if they have a disability, or some other social service facility.

Spend the night in a shelter and report back on your experience. Shelters are miserable and you'll get your crap stolen and the staff will magically lose your medication.

Social Security is a process that takes years. The majority of people who are homeless became homeless going through the process, and Trump isn't making it any better by insisting people need to work in order to get benefits. A large portion of these people are disabled, so they can't work!

Street children are poor or homeless children who live on the streets of a city, town, or village. Homeless youth are often called street kids or street child; the definition of street children is contested, but many practitioners and policymakers use UNICEF's concept of boys and girls, aged under 18 years, for whom ""the street"" (including unoccupied dwellings and wasteland) has become home and/or their source of livelihood, and who are inadequately protected or supervised. Street girls are sometimes called gamines, a term that is also used for Colombian street children of either sex.Some street children, notably in more developed nations, are part of a subcategory called thrown-away children, consisting of children who have been forced to leave home. Thrown-away children are more likely to come from single-parent homes.

Vacant house next door was in foreclosure and vacant for years. Fannie Mae acquired it, flipped it, and put it on the market when the market was hot. Lots of interested buyers. 

Then, not 20 days after it was listed, people moved in in the middle of the night. Then moved in more stuff the next several days. There seemed to be random people showing up at random times, but the piles of trash on the back porch kept building up and not being taken to the curb. Then we started seeing rats and more flies. 

Then their grass started getting really long. We tried talking to them but they were rarely around, showing up intermittently, with different people in different cars. And, unfortunately, sometimes a little girl aged around 4 years old.

Once the rats started showing up more in our yard I filed multiple 311s on the BaltCo app. The city would come mow the lawn and leave a bill, but the trash remained. 

Finally, about 10-11 months later, an eviction notice was on the door!! The sheriff came to evict but no one was there. The electricity had been shut off for at least a few weeks so we hadn‚Äôt seen anyone come back for a while: 

Few days later, the mortgage company hired someone to change the locks and clean out the house. I chatted with the guys cleaning it out who said there was no furniture, but piles of designer bags, trash, and weed ashtrays on every window. The new fridge was so disgusting inside they taped it up and threw the whole thing away.

I talked with the broker who managed the property who said that they were squatters, and this has been a huge problem all over the city. It took months for the courts to allow them to evict these people and take the property back. A few days after the house was cleaned out, the ‚Äúlandlord‚Äù and ‚Äútenant‚Äù showed up, trying to get in, confused why their keys didn‚Äôt work, and searched the porch for a hidden key. They gave up and left, but a few weeks later, police returned because another neighbor saw someone trying to break in. 

The brokers put big huge locks on all the doors. That probably turned off prospective buyers, but eventually someone did buy it and now we have lovely neighbors who take out their trash and mow their lawn! Couldn‚Äôt ask for much more than that. 

All this taught me about squatters and how to spot potential squatters. Turns out all my 311 requests helped a lot to get the courts to back up evicting them. If they‚Äôre not caring for the property and causing a public health concern, they have more evidence to support they are squatting and must be evicted. Otherwise it can be hard to get them out.

BPD‚Äôs policy 807 ([PDF](https://public.powerdms.com/BALTIMOREMD/documents/211764)) states that enforcement action can only be taken if the complainant is the owner or the property or an agent working on behalf of the owner. Furthermore, officers shall not remove the occupants if they have a lease, no matter how illegitimate the document may appear. Officers should refer the owner/agent to the civil court and advise them of the eviction process.

Also, calling for a domestic assault when you are not an involved party nor have witnessed the assault is not productive, no matter how well intentioned you are. When an officer shows up, they can only initiate enforcement with the cooperation of the victim and it is common for the victim to refuse to cooperate, especially if they did not call 911.

On top of this, you have said that you have used the 911 system to report DV for the goal of having them evicted - I understand that you are frustrated, but this is misuse of the 911 system. The more often you call to report an unfounded DV, the less likely that police will respond promptly when a real DV call comes out at the location you‚Äôve put repeated calls for service in as an uninvolved party.

There are two effective means for removal of squatters: Eviction (which can only be initiated by the property owner/agent) and an order to vacate pursuant to a residence being declared unfit for habitation.

The latter method is initiated through notifying the City. The easiest way is via the 311 app. The Housing Authority will ultimately conduct the inspection and take the appropriate action.",1,2024-05-08 15:42:12 UTC,squatter

You do need to consult with a licensed attorney if you're not getting what you need from law enforcement (don't worry, I provided a few links for resources). 

The legal term for squatters rights is adverse possession. In order to make a claim of adverse possession, if I remember correctly, the person would have to live there for 20 years without you noticing or telling them to leave. 

Really not sure why you're having to go through the eviction process every time for what amounts to trespassers. Just because someone isn't currently occupying a home doesn't mean that it's a free-for-all, and that anyone can just jump in there with a sleeping bag and a change of clothes and say they live there. If that were true, none of us would go on vacation, LOL. And I would live in a waaay nicer house. 

To my understanding, the police should be able to escort someone off of your property if they are trespassing without you having to file any type of eviction paperwork. They certainly wouldn't be able to present any evidence that they are on the property with your permission; they don't have a lease, a rental agreement, and Airbnb receipt, phone calls or text messages between you and them agreeing to let them stay there for free.

My suggestion, if the police aren't helping, would be to reach out to Maryland legal aid or the Maryland pro bono project (https://probonomd.org/) to see if you could speak to an attorney about low/no cost options.

Well... It's not ""legal"" to tell the police that you just now drove by and noticed the person there, when you actually already knew. Dunno how they could prove you're lying, or why they'd want to, but.... Not supposed to lie on a police report.


It's unlikely that the police will do anything to the squatters if they appear to be occupying the property. If it looks like they're just chilling, partying, not establishing residence, you could probably ask the police to take action. If the people appear to have set up a home base, you have to go through eviction same as before.

Getting squatters out (legally) is a civil process. The owner (in this case the bank) would have to go through the courts and get an eviction, then get the sheriff to serve the eviction. In Baltimore city it can take months. (I actually know a lot of landlords who will pay a squatter cash to leave voluntarily).

The other option is to make life so annoying for the squatters that they leave voluntarily. Are they hooked up to the electric grid legally? If they're stealing utilities then BGE will certainly take care of that. The police or housing inspectors knocking on the door every day will also be annoying. 

Banks usually don't bother doing this - they're not landlords, they don't want to manage the property. They want to bank. Chances are the bank will eventually sell the house either through a realtor or an auction house to an investor who will then have to deal with the squatters and rehab the house. You can try to accelerate this process by letting someone at the bank know about the squatters. Ask whoever mows the lawn for their contact. Chances are it's a realtor or property manager in the area who is dealing with a portfolio of properties. If you let them know what's going on they might decide to move on this one quickly.

What downtown needs is 50K+ new households with 100K+ incomes. That's the demographics you need to support the retail and dining we all love of walkable urban areas. Not more homeless people or extreme low income people who pretty much only live off convenience store junk. You may not like this in your vision of a thriving and diverse downtown but it's people with money who carry everyone else and right now Baltimore just does not have enough of that demographic in downtown or Mount Vernon. We are so far off from having the problems experienced in Manhattan and other urban areas that have become a rich man's playground that it's fantasy to just even contemplate it.

But the other topic is the high cost of building a handful of affordable housing upts. 600k per unit is ridiculous given that 600k is the the upper end price for a 1-bedroom \*luxury\* condo by the waterfront and those are from developers making a profit. Something smells funny with the rationale by these affordable housing people and it's not because I don't want low income people to have decent housing, but why can't it be at least double the number of units?

They were terrible. Breeding grounds for future drug dealers. 

You've changed the topic by talking about homeless people. The homeless are homeless for reasons that have little to do with affordable housing. Most homeless are people with substantial drug and mental problems, the only housing they can feasibly have is free housing. And not all of them would take it, believe it or not. 

Among the non homeless who qualify for subsidized housing, you're also talking about very poor people. No matter how cheap housing is, this segment,  who are poor largely due to lack of education or skills, will never afford to own or rent on their own. Homeownership and even unsubsidized renting at a minimum requires a certain threshold for both finances and reliability and is not related to housing affordability. That threshold is pretty low. The very poor's lack of experience, skills or education is not related to the affordability of housing. 

For normal people who can hold on to jobs and get on with life, there isn't a housing shortage or affordability problem in Baltimore. It may not be fancy or in a good school district, but it's not difficult to buy or rent a decent place and have a dry roof over your head and is affordable and safe enough.

Jobs given to disabled people for being disabled have frequently been predatory (sheltered workshops etc) and your ideas seem about on that same line. It would be better to improve access and stregthen anti discrimination laws than to do as you're suggesting.

With children, I'm sure you must be aware how expensive childcare is, with more than one small child it can be more than what someone earns at a minimum wage job. If the children are not otherwise being abused or neglected I don't think it's in their best interest to be taken away from their parent(s), because they had children without being completely financially stable and those children should have a place to live and food and so on.

In cities like NYC, Boston, and SF, affordable housing means $500k apartments instead of $1.2 million, so professionals making 80, 90, 100, 120k a year can live within an hour of their jobs.

What does it mean in Baltimore? 

A quick zillow search shows that there are 500+ homes for sale in the city that are between $50,000 and $100,000 (and they're habitable, too). 

Using the 30% rule, you need to make 17k a year to afford a $50,000 house. That's $11/hour, 30 hours a week. $100k would be $33k a year, which translates to 16.50 an hour, full time.

1.) Affordable housing cannot be built where luxury housing is being built.  If baltimore is growing, they need housing expansion of  of all kinds.

2.) Tax subsidies for luxury housing mean there are less subsidies for lower cost housing.  Only so much tax deals to go around.

3.) There are now comparatively less affordable housing than luxury housing, and more people demanding it.  Price goes up.

4.) The holders of empty luxury housing are under less pressure to lower rent to bring in tenants because the sweet tax deals help them hold the land and wait while the value of the land goes up.  Eventually either tenants will eventually come or you sell the land at a profit.

1.). You are right that affordable housing wouldn't necessarily get built in plots where luxury housing is built, but something else would.  These 'Other things' might compete with affordable housing, or they might compete with still other things that eventually would compete with affordable housing.  Land is inelastic and no part of a city is an island.  It's true that you can't put any building just anywhere but overbuilding one type of structure does affect the supply of land for others, even in other parts of a city.

2) it would be really helpful to have concrete numbers for this sort of thing, but the law of subsidy seems illustrative.  (Subsidize something and you get more of it.). If Baltimore isn't growing at a fast rate, we should have an overcapacity of whatever is being subsidized most especially since supply is out of step with demand.

3.) That is a fair point.  It impacts point 2 as well, I'll admit.  I would say that the relationship of overbuilt luxury housing should hold even if we limit the scope to just those neighborhoods.

4.)Do you know why the alternative is often a parking lot? Because they are the most efficient use of land when you figure in property taxes.  If a land owner wants to make an easy buck he just holds land in an area with rising property values, puts up something that adds no value to the community (and thus does not attract the eye of the assessor) and waits for land values to rise enough for him to sell.  The tax breaks for luxury apartments are letting land holders do the same thing while using public money to finance improvements that aren't in demand.   I agree  the city is getting  a better deal than the Parking lot, but there is actually a simple easy fix to both issues.",1,2017-12-25 19:44:32 UTC,affordable housing

It would encourage inclusionary (mixed) housing development rather than force people to pick their housing based solely on where a landlord would accept their voucher. Most vouchers are redeemed in East and West Baltimore so the trust could theoretically slightly help spatially distribute these households throughout the city.

but you can't have robust transit without better public safety. people don't like taking transit if they don't feel safe. our ridership per unit density is terrible, even along corridors with great transit (metro, light rail). other cities with similarly little rail have much better ridership.

> realistic job opportunities

again, public safety drives away businesses, residents with more disposable income, and tourists, which all reduce available jobs. there is an economic phenomenon called the ""economic multiplier effect"" where money into an area from outside has an effect on the local economy that is much greater (multiplied by 1/marginal propensity to save). for the US, that's typically between 5x and 10x. so every tourist that brings money into the city has as much as 10x the economic stimulus as someone within the city spending that money. however, we have squeegee kids, dirtbikers, shootings, assaults, etc. etc. that drive tourists away, and with them go jobs. governments don't create most jobs, spending creates jobs because that spending becomes someone's income, which then gets spent and becomes someone else's income, etc. etc..   

&#x200B;

>quality affordable housing

again, we have plenty of housing stock, but if people don't feel safe, there won't be high demand to live in them, so they aren't valuable enough to keep in good shape, so they either fall apart or a slumlord buys them and puts the minimum required repairs to keep it making money. without a good economy, the ability for people to own homes is diminished and the incentive to fix them up is also diminished.",2,2022-07-26 16:28:17 UTC,affordable housing

What is the number one issue that is driving lack of growth in Baltimore?,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/w8h8ik/what_is_the_number_one_issue_that_is_driving_lack/,2022-07-26 11:23:19 UTC,">Congregations are generally made up of locals, if a church has a low-income/stressed congregation, what could they do to ""step up their game""?

This isn't true, at least not in Baltimore City. City churches usually have congregations from outside the immediate neighborhood.  Source: my company builds a lot of parking lots, we do a lot of parking lots for churches. They want big parking lots with tall fences and locking gates to keep out the ""locals"". Some of the church project quotes are hundreds of thousands of dollars for secure parking lots to keep out the ""poor"". It's pretty messed up.

Churches are tax exempt because originally, they did some of the social services the government would otherwise do. Shelter the homeless, feed the poor, take care of orphaned kids and vacant land.  The tax exemption is the reward for those services. They don't pay property tax or income tax. AND a lot of churches rent out their space, so that's tax free income. PLUS they get government grants and money from outside their congregations.

I was thinking churches need to contribute effort, not funding. Three of the churches in my area left because of political bs. Before they left one had a thrift store run by retired older women, they did spaghetti dinners for everyone in the neighborhood to get to know each other, they had a food pantry that was part of the Maryland Food Bank system, they had a volunteer social worker who referred people to services. Another church held community picnics in the park and did community clean ups with us. The third church had a mens group that mentored people. I don't think those activities cost much money. It takes a lot of effort and people work hours. The churches bring people into the neighborhood. Those people could put some effort into making the are better instead of donating money to keep the locals out.",1,2022-07-27 17:58:51 UTC,homeless

Unless, I misunderstood what you're saying, you seem to be arguing that developers would naturally make affordable housing if there was a profit in it for them.  But affordable housing by its very nature of being affordable, doesn't generate profit.  Even if it did, I'm not sure a developer would build them anyway because the profit will never be as high as what they'd get for a full value house.  But that's a housing/profit issue not an inclusionary zoning issue.  Inclusionary zoning is the solution to this problem not a cause.  You have to force (incentivize if you will) developers to build affordable housing which is what this law tried to do.  However, the law, as written, states they only have to include affordable houses if the city has the funds to help pay for it.  But the city doesn't have any money in the budget or anyway of getting that money to pay the builders.  That creates a situation where the builders don't actually have to include affordable housing because there is no legal motive nor profit advantage to do so - so they don't.  This passage from the report gets to the core issues with the law written as it is:

> Since 2007, the current policy has produced only 37 units (primarily due to projects being exempted from providing affordable units since the required City contribution would exceed established cost thresholds per unit). 

In other words, the city only had money to force developers to include 37 affordable housing units since 2007 so that's all that got built.  This quote gets to the core of the issues with the current law:

> ...[T]he current policy sets a threshold on the amount of funding the City of Baltimore can provide for an affordable unit.  If the cost per affordable unit exceeds the threshold, the developer can be exempted from providing the affordable units.  Figure 2 below provides the threshold limits for total City contribution per affordable unit, which varies based on the AMI served.  The thresholds limits are fixed and do not adjust over time based on inflation or increased development costs.  As a result, the ability to fund units within the threshold becomes more difficult with each passing year

Figure 2 shows that, as of the report (last Aug, I believe) 1 60% AMI studio apartment and 2 100% AMI 1 bedroom apartments are covered by the funds the city has available, meaning anything else isn't covered and a developer doesn't have to build it.  


>I also found it interesting that the report says Baltimore would have generated more affordable housing units if it had not done a subsidy to developers but just lowered the requirements so that only 5-10% of new units must be affordable. Hopefully the new policy improves on that because that is a pretty horrendous stat.

It is interesting and going on the numbers they provide it would have been 1080 units (instead of the 540 estimate they have) if the city had just funded the law properly.  It's not even large numbers they talk about in the report - $3 million over the life of each project to fully support the entire 20%. The [cities budget](https://bbmr.baltimorecity.gov/sites/default/files/SOTA%20Baltimore.FY22.compressed.pdf) for FY2022 is $3.5billion.

Yes you will likely find your people, but you may want to expand your neighborhood search. There's like 200-something neighborhoods in Baltimore--go beyond Canton.
2. There are some homeless people downtown. I lived alone downtown when I was fresh out of college and it never bothered me. That includes walking my dog alone at 1am. 
3. I'm not sure why they're so affordable, but my 4 bed/2 bath was less than half the cost of all my friends' homes in the surrounding suburbs. It's in great shape and I have a backyard!
4. I ended up in Baltimore, but after living here for 5 years, would never leave.
5. Some neighborhoods are more family-friendly than others. I haven't lived in Canton or Brewer's Hill, but from what I've seen, they tend to run mid-late 20's, no-kids. Look at some of the neighborhoods in East Baltimore for more family-friendliness (Waverly, Mayfield, Lauraville, Hamilton, etc.). My neighborhood has 2 playgrounds within walking distance and is surrounded by three large parks.
6. Bonus: I'm a first grade teacher here. Baltimore gets a bad rep for education, but amazing changes are happening. Our district has some of the best curriculum in the country. Everything is aligned to the Science of Reading (so your kid will actually learn how to read, instead of memorizing words). There's a ton of great programs in city schools right now. Your daughter will likely be successful in any school she goes to, Hampstead Hill or not. Also, some of those ""great"" schools (cough, Roland Park, cough) get overcrowded.

Should We Move to Baltimore?,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/vsdb65/should_we_move_to_baltimore/,2022-07-06 01:01:25 UTC,"Go for Canton/Highlandtown/Brewers hill, all will fit in that budget for a very nice house (will probably save some if the market goes downward). Patterson Park has lots of events, Canton has tons of great restaurants and dive bars, Highlandtown is the arts districts with first Friday art walks each month, creative alliance events, and lots of cool little shops and more diverse than the others. Brewers Hill is still building up and is more of apartments but has some nice little spots of its own and is a good discount over Canton. If you want the family vibe. Greektown has some nice newish Ryan Homes, which have a lot of early families and a quieter vibe, feels kind of like suburbs in the city with more open grassy areas and generally quiet neighbors, but less of a nice area in terms of things to do/crime. Not dangerous per se just have to drive to most places for food/events so loses the walkability factor.

Canton is the established nicest area, but all 3 are low crime (Highlandtown south of Lombard street and west of Highlandtown ave are the same safety profile). Walkability to everything, many events and fun breweries/events for kids. It will be noisier so just have to be prepped for that, but if you find a good neighborhood with 1) brick walls or ideally brick walls plus drywall for sound reduction and 2) good, respectful neighbors, the noise isn't so bad.

Also for Baltimore this trio of neighborhoods has really been on the rise, so you can expect strong home value appreciation in the long-term. People that don't know Baltimore complain about the murder rate, if you avoid the (obvious) areas of boarded up homes and high crime it is no problem. Canton/Highlandtown/Brewers Hill average maybe 1 murder every 3 or 4 years despite being one of the most populous areas of the city. Great people, fun events, fairly inexpensive and an area constantly growing. Really IMO the only thing missing is more live music, where Fells Point takes a big W.

As many have said, there are tons of nice neighborhoods so find your right fit, I just know these 3 very well. Dont listen to anyone that doesn't currently live in Baltimore about homeless/crime, they either are ignorant of it and follow the generic racist chatter of cities being a murder haven (not that its without issue but every neighborhood is unique so you can't group west Baltimore with the safer-than-suburbs Canton), and people that moved out often lead a different life now and trash the city they loved at the right time in their life. It might also be worth renting a spot for a year so 1) the housing market cools off and 2) its easier for you to day trip it to spots you'd consider living long-term. If the market plays right you may save money by renting for a year and also finding the right home for you.",4,2022-07-06 20:52:04 UTC,homeless

There seems to be a good art scene here. Baltimore is pretty liberal and lots of people live lots of different life styles. 
2. While crime is high per capita, it is generally targeted and contained to certain neighborhoods. That‚Äôs not good for many reasons, but it‚Äôs not like most of us are out here fighting for our lives in the daily. There are certainly homeless people but to say there are vagrants everywhere is incorrect. 
3. I‚Äôve lived here 10 years and still haven‚Äôt figured it out. Crime rates? Poor public transportation? Lacks the scenery of PNW cities? Lacks the glamor of NY, LA, and DC? Like someone else mentioned, while houses are cheap, cost of living adds up. 
4. Baltimore tends to be a place where you‚Äôre all in, or you want out. So if you find your place here, you‚Äôll love it. I think people can definitely be called. 
5. Federal Hill and Locust Point are nice neighborhoods with good elementary schools, plenty of kids and kid friendly places. Though it is also popular with college kids/early 20, especially some of the bars. I feel like the weekend night time crowds have been bigger since things opened back up after Covid, compared to pre-Covid. If you‚Äôre interested in more space and/or a yard, I would also look at the Hamilton and Lauraville area. It‚Äôs pretty far north east in the city, but you‚Äôd have space, I think Hamilton elem is decent, and I know there are people in the area that you would probably fit right in with.

It shouldn't be a rug to sweep people under, it should be a legitimate safety net for people in financial crisis. 

On the other hand dedicating 17 acres (which blew me away, I didn't think it was that big and I drive through it nearly every day) of some of the best real estate in the city to it seems kind of nuts for a city that seems to be trying to claw its way back. They were built in the 40s and maybe that made more sense demographically or economically at the time, but right now the corridor between Fells and Harbor East is bursting with opportunity. Unfortunately you get less investment next to a housing project as expansive as this. Perkins is for sure why the stretch between broadway and central on eastern or fleet is a bit of a ghost town. It's also why Broadway above fleet hasn't been more developed.

I think if they did it smart, they could make a good amount of affordable housing but not focus it in one powder keg like they are now.

I would recommend any of those neighborhoods to anyone.

--Pikesville is fine. Boring and bland with typical suburban shopping. Like strip malls/shopping plazas, Target. A nearby Costco and Wegmans. Car centric. At the terminus of the one subway line if that matters. A short drive to a light rail stop. You need a car. You know what it reminds me of? Willowdale/North York but way worse mass transit. 

--Columbia is fine. Another boring and bland suburb but more üí∞üíµüí∞. Good location if you need access to both Baltimore and DC though. In the US, wealth makes good schools because schools are mostly funded by local tax: money follows the wealthy people and the poor people just get scraps. Howard County is a case study in the former. You need a car. Same access to suburban stuff like strip malls, Costco, Wegmans. Just Google history of Columbia, MD. They planned it to be diverse, and it still kinda is. But money, power, and respect are still very tied to proximity to whiteness in this country then and now so, I dunno. Just see for yourself.

*Mount Washington is a suburb in the city. You need a car. Very bucolic and pretty peaceful imo. But expensive. Downtown and Mount Vernon are basically core of urban Baltimore. Lots of historic beautiful architect ture, walkable to parks, and the waterfront. Mostly renters some homeowners. I could not afford to buy over there, but I rented there for years and loved it. A good neighborhood for families that want to stay in the city but also like suburban trappings. Maybe like getting off at Lawrence Station in Toronto. 

*Downtown and Mount Vernon: probably the best places I've lived in my time in Maryland. There are more homeless services in downtown than Mount Vernon so the homeless of the city are concentrated in Downtown, right next to expensive condos and apartments, government buildings, etc. Lots of walkabilty and access to subway stops and light rail depending where you live in Downtown or Mount Vernon. Good amount of bike lanes. Access to regional and interstate train stations in or near both. Both are my favorite places I've lived in Baltimore. The most city feeling of the neighborhoods I've lived in in Baltimore. You have to be aware of your surroundings in any city, same in Baltimore. I was more vigilant in Downtown and Mount Vernon than Mount Washington. Downtown and Mount Vernon could be comparable to the neighborhoods around Wellesley and College stations in Toronto. Maybe even Queen for some parts of downtown. 

*Butchers Hill is what I am now calling an urban rowhome suburb. To the north and east are areas with more crime, but this legit feels like a bubble. It's walkable to John's Hopkins Hospital and the waterfront. Lots of city services. Lots of wealthy or middle class homeowners but a fair share of renters. Racially mixed, but probably 60/30 white to other races? That is a guess, I haven't looked at Census data lately. Most of the crime in Downtown, Mount Vernon, and Butchers Hill is property crime. My neighbors kids go to Baltimore schools they literally walk to from their homes. People walk their dogs all hours of the day and nigh in Butchers Hill. You are still in the city, so must be aware of your surroundings. You can walk to the metro at Hopkins which is the other terminus for the subway line. There are buses. But you will most likely need a car. Street parking if you don't have a parking pad or garage. I get Summerhill and St. Clair vibes here, but not as much money and a bit grittier. The architecture here is not, though. I'd say baltimore neighborhoods of Abell, Charles Village have housing stock more similar to Summerhill than the Rowhome style in Butchers Hill. 

Occasionally people get mugged around here (Butchers Hill), but I haven't heard of any in a while. Probably slightly higher frequency in Downtown and Mount Vernon. It's getting warmer now so I'm sure more ne'er-do-wells will be ne'er-do-welling.

--

Hope this helps somewhat. If someone natives of Toronto could jump in, they'd probably give better descriptors than me. These are not the only livable neighborhoods these are just the ones I have lived in. I would have loved to live in Ednor Gardens for example or even Reservoir Hill, but the real estate gods were not on my side last year.",73,2023-05-06 12:32:42 UTC,homeless

The section 8 voucher list has been closed in Baltimore City for a long time, it briefly opened for a lottery and closed again. Even the public housing list closed. People who lose public housing like this often get vouchers if they're not transferred to other public housing, but that doesn't solve the issue of being able to use the voucher. If they get a voucher and can't use it in the specified time then they will end up either becoming homeless or paying 90% of their income in rent. That's not a better situation. You don't actually know if they're all getting a better situation. That's the problem with this, that's the problem with all the closure of projects and the scheme where they've given the high rises to private companies who must keep them subsidized for 20 years and can do whatever they want after that.

Deconcentrating poverty with vouchers or some other type of subsidy is a good idea if there are enough of them and if the amount covers places other than in poor neighborhoods (because then what's the difference really) and some kind of real system to incentivize or require more landlords to take them.

My newly formed neighborhood group is doing a deep dive into the reasons and how to fix it.

Investment companies bought a lot of these owner-occupied properties. Less than half were turned into rentals priced way above market then subsidized through section 8. Most properties were left empty and refinanced for millions of dollars. It's called Mortgage Pass Through Investment Securities. One house was auctioned off for $75,000 because of housing fines and other tax fees, then refinanced for $1,533,551. No improvements to the house. No one is maintaining it. It went from being a nice house with an elderly couple living there to a vacant nuisance house, home for rats.

I've heard from other neighbors that my councilperson Phylicia Porter isn't interested in affordable housing. ""It isn't her thing."" I know from experience she isn't responsive to anyone outside her little friend circle.

It's really messed up. The refinance thing makes the average sale price for houses in the neighborhood jump up. So other landlords are increasing rent. Our tax assessment is going to go up. But no one is appraising these houses at $250,000 or $300,000. And no one is going to pay $200,000 for a rowhouse in Violetville just because some investment company did a refi for $1.5 million on the vacant next door.

I own my house, so only the property tax increase affects me directly.  The vacants are really bringing the neighborhood down. PLUS our neighborhood lost at least 30 homes from the housing stock. I'm sure that contributes to higher rent and less affordable housing.

I don't know what would help. The more our group researches the worse it looks. It does seem like elected officials are benefiting and don't really care about making sure everyone had access to affordable housing.",14,2022-08-20 01:01:44 UTC,affordable housing

Having just moved back to Baltimore from DC, I can't help but think that this type of NIMBYism is going to bite the city in the ass if/when it ever becomes a place a lot of people want to move to. We had it in DC from between 2005-2020 where demand for housing was far outpacing supply and prices went nuts. The pandemic helped reduce rents some temporarily, and fortunately plenty of new units have come online in the last couple of years, but it really really sucked for about 5-10 years. SF is in an equally horrible housing situation that's due in no-small part to historical preservation at the expense of mid-rise development.

It is important how it is done. Allowing people to break promises/contracts and leave landlords on the hook without recourse is not right. Just the fact they are landlords does not make them evil.

What this country needs is widespread redistribution of wealth so people can pay rent without breaking their contracts. You achieve this by increasing taxes on the rich to fund social/jobs programs that then put money in the pockets of people who need it. Championing squatters to live free on someone elses dime is not the way IMO.

The problem is no one has yet setup a program that allows safe use, provides shelter, counsels and everything else that goes with recovery. I am not saying that us doing this is that full program but, IMO, it's a start. 

There was a drugs inc. episode years ago where a scandanavian country started something similar and it has had hugely positive effects. They followed a woman who got hooked on heroin from a prescription of opioids. She went to clinic to get her ""high"" from a doctor went to work stopped by the clinic in the afternoon to get another ""high"" and then went home to make dinner and feed her kids. A year prior she was living on the street after abandoning her kids and husband. Part of the program requirements were checking in daily and the doctor worked to slowly lower her dose over months with the idea that she would be clean by a certain date.

Obviously that program took a ton of money and isn't going to work for everyone but it certainly sounds a lot better than arresting people so they can go to jail and still do heroin in jail anyways.

You sound like a college freshman, mesmerized by theory but unable to see the human lives that it impacts.

1. It's a concept. The idea is that without a collective choice being made, we're making poor individual ones, such as a slumlord holding back a neighborhood by waiting to maximize investment.

3. You're misrepresenting what HUD does. M on Madison is not ""free money"". It is affordable housing. People that pay rent, but the market failed to create housing for them because the margin wasn't there. Additionally, when you reduce the burden of housing cost, you free up a lot more spending power and can help to develop beyond a basic economy.

4. Why do you think increasing the tax rate on vacant properties is the same thing as seizing them? While OP suggested it, it wouldn't necessarily happen.
