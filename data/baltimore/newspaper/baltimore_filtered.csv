Thats the Scot Presler question. Mr. Presler2 is the man who has been voluntarily cleaning up garbage accumulated in Democrat-run cities. Hes not drawing big crowds, but the question is still pretty poignant. Answering the questionThe Democratic Party3 is actively promoting expansion of sanctuary policies.",homeless
baltimore,Democrats Care More About Illegal Aliens Than,2020-02-15T00:00:00Z,Granite Grok,The Baltimore Sun,"They are all in on giving illegals free health care and drivers licenses4. But why are we doing for illegal aliens when we have not taken care of homeless Americans5? Why do we treat homeless Americans worse6 than the ASPCA treats stray or abused animals? The hallmark of our West Coast cities7 is their homeless people. Presler noted California is one of the biggest economies in the world8. With that said, its capital, Sacramento would rather cater to illegals instead of homeless Americans9. California is a sanctuary state10. This sure seems like a problem in priorities11. Presler noted both his father and grandfather had served their country12 in the military. He too is doing his part cleaning up communities around the country because he gives a damn. Presler says, The Democrat Party does not put our people first. Yes, he is going to vote for Donald Trump in 2020. To him Nancy Pelosi is a do-nothing politician13. Presler hopes the video of him asking this question will go viral.The op-edPresler has organized a clean-up of Baltimore which he wrote about in an op-ed in the Sun14. While our volunteers were inspired to pick up trash, we knew this had to be more than just a Band-Aid. So, we took the opportunity to zip our mouths and listen to the residents. Louise, 81-years-old and 4-foot-10 inches tall, took me by the hand to show me where her neighborhood needs help. She told me how people from outside the city are illegally dumping trash at the bandos, or abandoned buildings. Even worse, Louise said that the city only sends a truck once a year to clean out the alleys. A grandmother ran out to us after seeing reports of the cleanup on the news. She has sent videos of vehicles illegally dumping in the area, but the city has not taken action. I gave her my cell number and promised to post any videos she sends me all over social media so we can combat this illegal trash dumping. I also encouraged her to knock on every one of her neighbors doors to tell the city how they feel. In addition to the grandmother, I promised Louise that we would return. On Monday, Sept. 9, we are coming back to Baltimore for cleanup 2. We would like to cordially invite The Baltimore Sun to join our efforts and help pick up trash.Dont tell me Show meThe proof is in the pudding. Democrats dont care15 about the homeless. They never have cared16 about the homeless. Caring for the homeless versus the goal of advancing the party17, thats whats being weighed. Democrats have made the decision18. It is apparent they put Party over American people. Dont believe it? Wheres the American flag on their debate stage? What do they really want to be president of? That is why they dont care about Angel Moms19. They dont care about mothers whose loved ones have been killed by illegal aliens20. They want these illegal aliens21 to be new voters. Its party over people22. They dont care about full term babies born live23 after an abortion attempt. They want to kill them. Democrats care about party. They just dont care about people. Why do Democrats care more about illegal aliens than homeless Americans in the streets is a symptom not the root cause.

DATELINE TALLAHASSEE Wilton Simpson says water quality funding will remain a priority despite slimmer budget3 via Drew Wilson of Florida Politics Simpson told attendees at the Florida Chambers Transportation, Growth amp38 Infrastructure Solution Summit that funding water quality initiatives would be a priority during his term despite budget challenges. One of the tentpoles of his water agenda will be increased investments in water storage north of the Everglades. Simpsons other priority is creating a robust septic to sewer program. The single largest supplier of nutrient load going into our water systems today are septic tanks, so when you think about what you can do to really have a large impact for the next 100 years on this state, the northern Everglades is a step a big step but the second step would be making sure you have a very aggressive septic to sewer program. Despite a tighter budget, Senate President Wilton Simpson will seek to boost funding for water quality in 2021. Image via Colin Hackley. Minor marijuana convictions could be erased in Florida by new bill4 via Desiree Stennett of the Orlando Sentinel People across Florida could see their misdemeanor marijuana convictions wiped away if a new bill by state Sen. Randolph Bracy becomes law. Bracy announced the legislation Tuesday at a news conference outside Curaleaf, a medical marijuana dispensary on Semoran Boulevard. He will introduce the bill during the 2021 Legislative Session. The bill will apply to misdemeanor marijuana convictions, including distribution and possession of fewer than 20 grams. While the bill would not automatically expunge records, it would make it easier for people with these convictions to get them removed. All court fees to clear records would also be waived. Challenge to Leon County mask mandate dismissed5 via Jim Saunders of News Service of Florida An appeals court has tossed out a challenge by the Leon County Republican Party chairman to a county requirement that people wear face masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The 1st District Court of Appeal on Monday dismissed an appeal filed by Leon County GOP Chairman Evan Power after a circuit judge rejected the challenge in July. The dismissal did not address underlying constitutional issues in the case but stemmed from Powers attorney, state Rep. Anthony Sabatini not filing an initial brief at the appeals court. The Leon County Commission passed its ordinance June 23 amid a surge of coronavirus cases. The ordinance requires people to wear masks inside businesses, with some exceptions, and threatened fines for noncompliance. CORONAFLORIDA Florida adds 7,985 coronavirus cases, 98 deaths Tuesday6 via Natalie Weber of the Tampa Bay Times The Florida Department of Health reported 7,985 coronavirus cases and 98 deaths Tuesday, raising the total number of deaths to 19,627. There have been 1,073,770 people infected with the virus in Florida since March. The state has reported roughly 9,372 cases and 102 deaths per day this week. The number of deaths added each day does not necessarily reflect the number of people who died the previous day, as it can take officials up to two weeks to confirm and report coronavirus-related deaths. Florida has reported the third-highest number of cases during the pandemic, behind Texas, which has had more than 1.2 million cases and California, which has recorded over 1.3 million cases. Gov. Ron DeSantis says all long-term care residents could receive COVID-19 vaccinations this month7 via David Fleshler and Cindy Krischer Goodman of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel Every resident of long-term care facilities in Florida could receive a COVID-19 vaccination by the end of this month, DeSantis said Tuesday at a White House vaccines summit. The Governors ambitious schedule would mean that about 145,000 residents of 4,000 facilities would receive the vaccinations within the next few weeks, if they want them. Vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna are expected to receive approval this week and next. We could have every resident of nursing homes and long-term care facilities vaccinated in the month of December, DeSantis said at a White House panel discussion with three other Governors. Thats within our grasp right now. Ron DeSantis has an ambitious schedule for vaccinating all long-term care residents this month. Florida investigation into COVID-19 whistleblower draws rebuke from Charlie Crist, others8 via Ana Ceballos, Nicholas Nehamas and Sarah Blaskey of the TimesHerald Tallahassee Bureau Floridas law enforcement chief and state officials with DOH said their internal emergency communication system was hacked on Nov. 10, conjuring images of a nefarious digital break-in. With a search warrant in hand and guns drawn, police raided Jones Tallahassee home on Monday morning, seizing her computers and cellphone. U.S. Rep. Crist criticized the appearance of the raid. Unless we get more information showing otherwise, it looks like an act of retaliation or an attempt to silence Ms. Jones for her critiques of the states COVID-19 response, Crist said in a Tuesday statement. Jones has not been charged and denies sending the message, saying she doesnt have the technical skills to be a hacker. COVID-19 data whistleblower could face up to 5 years in prison if charged with cybercrime9 via Skyler Swisher and Mario Ariza of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel The state law used to justify a police raid at the home of a COVID-19 whistleblower suspected of accessing a Florida emergency messaging system without permission carries a stiff penalty Up to five years in prison. That means Jones, the DOH data scientist fired in May for alleged insubordination, may be in significant legal peril if prosecutors press third-degree felony charges. Aldo Leiva, an attorney with Baker Donelson who specializes in cybersecurity and data privacy law, said that Jones could face a much longer penalty up to 15 years if prosecutors proved she somehow disrupted the states systems or committed other aggravating offenses. But some legal experts think the state would be hard-pressed going after her in the courts. Hundreds of Florida renters evicted during pandemic despite CDC order10 via Emily L. Mahoney and Christopher ODonnell of the Tampa Bay Times The nationwide moratorium ordered by the CDC was supposed to protect renters who have lost work from the pandemic. After it was announced, DeSantis allowed Floridas eviction moratorium to lapse at the end of September, saying it would avoid confusion over which order was in force. But court records show that the federal order has failed to protect renters in Florida, including hundreds of Tampa Bay families, from losing their housing. By contrast, no writs were issued in April and May in Pinellas fewer than 25 were issued in Hillsborough in May and June when DeSantis moratorium largely stayed courts from completing evictions. Scott Rivkees Pfizer 5 will have COVID-19 vaccine next week11 via The News Service of Florida Floridas top public health official said five Florida hospitals could receive COVID-19 vaccinations as early as next week. According to executives on the phone call, Department of Health Secretary Rivkees, who also serves as the states Surgeon General, gave the update during a statewide call with hospital administrators. Referred to as the Pfizer 5, Broward Memorial, UF Health Jacksonville, Tampa General Hospital, Advent Health in Orlando, and Jackson Memorial in Miami will be the first Florida hospitals to receive the vaccine. Pfizer Inc.s vaccination will be sent after it receives emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administrations vaccine advisory committee, which meets on Dec. 10. Surgeon General Scott Rivkees says the Pfizer vaccine will soon arrive at five key Florida hospitals. Federal judge postpones NRA case, other trials12 via Dara Kam of The News Service of Florida Saying he is acting out of an abundance of caution, Chief U.S. District Judge Mark Walker is postponing all of his civil trials until the coronavirus pandemic is under control and the number of new COVID-19 cases and deaths in Florida has dropped. Walkers order came in a lawsuit involving the National Rifle Association. The gun-rights group is challenging a Florida law, passed in the aftermath of the 2018 mass shooting at a Parkland high school, that prevents people under age 21 from buying guns. The NRA lawsuit was scheduled for a Jan. 11 trial in Tallahassee, but Walkers order indefinitely postponed that trial and all other civil trials over which he presides. CORONA LOCAL DeSantis said no more virtual meetings. Some South Florida cities are doing it anyway13 via Aaron Liebowitz of the Miami Herald More than a half-dozen cities in South Florida have continued to hold government meetings entirely online as COVID-19 cases surge, even after DeSantis let his executive order allowing virtual meetings expire Nov. 1 and suggested they were no longer permitted. Many cities in Miami-Dade have adopted hybrid meeting models to try to comply with state law. For example, Miami Beach moved its meetings to the citys convention center, where commissioners are separated by drapes and piping and communicate with each other via teleconference. That way, theres an in-person quorum but still plenty of social distancing. With options limited, Miami-Dade tries a PR campaign to combat latest COVID spike14 via Douglas Hanks of the Miami Herald Miami-Dade has a new slogan for its COVID-19 fight as the county government faces a third spike in cases without the enforcement tools it wielded during the prior two. Mayor Daniella Levine Cava unveiled the We Can We Will campaign at a news conference Tuesday where she also acknowledged the county could use some stronger measures to combat a surge in cases overlapping with the higher risks from indoor gatherings during the holiday season. Levine Cava said Miami-Dade is reviving its mask enforcement this month but is also emphasizing the power of public relations in the countys latest COVID measure. Using county communications staff, her administration unveiled a public-service campaign revolving around the motto We Can Adapt. We Will Thrive. Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava is launching a new PR campaign to address the third spike in coronavirus cases. Were dealing with 3 whammos, health director says15 via Jane Musgrave of The Palm Beach Post Palm Beach Countys top health official Tuesday painted a grim picture of the coronavirus pandemic, calling recent increases in the countys positivity rate alarming and describing further spikes in cases as inevitable. County Health Director Dr. Alina Alonso said the recent uptick in cases is coming at the worst possible moment. We have three whammos happening at the same time, she said, ticking off the coming holiday season, the arrival of snowbirds and case counts that are already disturbingly high. The three factors combined means even more people will become infected, she said of the virus that has already stricken 69,855 people in the county. Vaccine distribution about to get ugly16 via Jane Musgrave of The Palm Beach Post To the dismay of Palm Beach County commissioners, at-risk elderly who dont live in nursing homes and first responders arent among the first wave of people who will get the coronavirus vaccine that is expected to be approved on Thursday. In addition to criticizing the priority system that has been tentatively established that would allow nursing home residents and hospital workers to be the first to get vaccinated, they voiced concern that no hospital in the county will receive the initial shipments of the vaccine. Adding to the unease, county Health Director Alonso said she hadnt been told whether the five hospitals in the state that will get initial batches will share it. A South Florida state Representative and her family have tested positive for COVID-1917 via David J. Neal of the Miami Herald The latest South Florida elected official to test positive for COVID-19 is Hollywood Democrat Marie Woodson, just elected to the Florida House of Representatives from Broward Countys District 101. Woodson announced Tuesday morning that she tested positive for COVID-19 after tests revealed her husband, Bob Woodson, and adult children, Bradley Woodson and Kelly Woodson, had the novel coronavirus. Consequently, we are quarantining at home, read a statement from Woodsons office. I am asking that you keep us in your prayers and continue to follow all CDC guidelines, while dealing with this pandemic. I will continue to work from home and serve the residents of District 101. Take care and be safe! Newly elected Rep. Marie Woodson and her family test positive for COVID-19. How many new COVID-19 cases in Central Florida? Who knows?18 via Scott Powers of Florida Politics The numbers of new cases for COVID-19 took dramatic twists Tuesday for Central Florida counties some exploding upward, some actually falling precipitously in the latest data released by the Florida Department of Health. Is the state reclassifying the county of residence for people with COVID-19 throughout Central Florida? Are the numbers being corrected due to some dramatic new findings? Or was there some sort of glitch that caused faulty numbers to be reported Tuesday? There was no immediate explanation from authorities. A DOH spokesperson said he would look into it. An Orange County spokesperson said county health officials also were asking the state for an explanation but had not yet received one by 5 p.m. Tuesday. Tampa International Airport CEO talks health safety efforts amid COVID-19 pandemic19 via Jason Delgado of Florida Politics Tampa International Airport CEO Joe Lopano talked Tuesday about the strategies hes used to protect travelers and staff amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Speaking at the Florida Chamber Foundations Transportation, Growth amp38 Infrastructure Solution Summit, the 30-year airport veteran said he searched for ways to convert the situation into an opportunity for reinvention. Lopano, who sat on DeSantis Reopen Florida Task Force as the only airport CEO, employed what he called the TPA Ready program. The program incorporated several strategies, many of which he learned from theme parks and hotels. In April, the airport was among the first in the nation to implement a mask mandate and install acrylic barriers, blocked off seating, social distancing signs and modern, touchless technology. Florida man coughed, sneezed, spit throughout a Best Buy after refusing mask, deputies say20 via Tiffini Thiesen of the Orlando Sentinel A Florida man who didnt want to wear a mask in a Best Buy on Saturday was booked on a disorderly conduct charge after he coughed, spit and sneezed throughout the store, deputies said. Employees at a Vero Beach location of the chain told the Indian River County Sheriffs Office that they asked Alton George Ashby multiple times to wear a mask to prevent the spread of coronavirus, per store policy. Ashby, 51, of Palm Bay was going to Geek Squad to get help but walked up with no mask, the store manager told deputies. Ashby then proceeded to walk around the connected department to do the same thing, according to the arrest affidavit. NATION U.S. virus deaths hit record levels with the holidays ahead21 via Lisa Marie Pane and Rachel La Corte of The Associated Press Deaths from COVID-19 in the U.S. have soared to more than 2,200 a day on average, matching the frightening peak reached last April, and cases per day have eclipsed 200,000 on average for the first time on record, with the crisis all but certain to get worse because of the fallout from Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years. Virtually every state is reporting surges just as a vaccine appears days away from getting the go-ahead in the U.S. What we do now literally will be a matter of life and death for many of our citizens, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said Tuesday as he extended restrictions on businesses and social gatherings, including a ban on indoor dining and drinking at restaurants and bars. Deaths from COVID-19 are hitting a frightening peak, just as the holidays are underway. Image via AP. Donald Trump hails vaccine miracle, with millions of doses soon22 via Zeke Miller of The Associated Press Trump celebrated the expected approval of the first U.S. vaccine for the coronavirus Tuesday as the White House worked to instill confidence in the massive distribution effort that will largely be executed by President-elect Joe Biden. Trump said the expected approvals are coming before most people thought possible. They say its somewhat of a miracle and I think thats true, he declared. Trump led Tuesdays White House event celebrating Operation Warp Speed, his administrations effort to produce and distribute safe and effective vaccines for COVID-19. The first vaccine, from drugmaker Pfizer, is expected to receive endorsement by a panel of Food and Drug Administration advisers as soon as this week. 8216I literally dont know Operation Warp Speed scientist cant explain Trumps vaccine order23 via Quint Forgey of POLITICO The chief scientist of the Trump administrations Operation Warp Speed was unable to explain Trumps latest executive order Tuesday, which aims to prioritize shipment of the coronavirus vaccine to Americans over other countries. Moncef Slaoui, who Trump tapped in May to head up the administrations efforts to hasten vaccine development, appeared puzzled when asked to clarify the Presidents order. Frankly, I dont know, and frankly, Im staying out of this. I cant comment, Slaoui said. I literally dont know. It remains unclear how Trumps executive order would be enforced, as drugmakers are already making agreements to deliver supplies for other countries. FDA review confirms safety and efficacy of Pfizer coronavirus vaccine24 via Carolyn Y. Johnson, Laurie McGinley, Chris Alcantara and Aaron Steckelberg of The Washington Post Pfizer enrolled approximately 44,000 people in its late-stage clinical study in the United States, Germany, Turkey, South Africa, Brazil and Argentina. So far, there have been 170 cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, in people who were not previously infected. Only eight of those cases were among people who received two shots of the vaccine, a strong signal of efficacy. Of all those participants who became sick with COVID-19, 10 became seriously ill all but one in the group that received the placebo test. Pfizers vaccine offers strong protection after first dose25 via Noah Weiland and Carl Zimmer of The New York Times The coronavirus vaccine made by Pfizer and BioNTech provides strong protection against COVID-19 within about 10 days of the first dose, according to documents published by the FDA before a meeting of its vaccine advisory group. The finding is one of several significant new results featured in the briefing materials, including more than 100 pages of data analyses from the agency and Pfizer. Last month, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that their two-dose vaccine had an efficacy rate of 95 after two doses administered three weeks apart. The new analyses show that the protection starts kicking in far earlier. Whats more, the vaccine worked well regardless of a volunteers race, weight or age. vaccine stood up to peer review, which will hasten its approval in the U.S. Image via USA Today. Pfizer tells U.S. officials it cannot supply substantial additional vaccine until late June or July26 via Laurie McGinley, Yasmeen Abutaleb and Carolyn Y. Johnson of The Washington Post Pfizer has told the Trumpadministration it cannot provide substantial additional doses of its coronavirus vaccine until late June or July because other countries have rushed to buy up most of its supply, according to multiple individuals familiar with the situation. That means the U.S. government may not be able to ramp up as rapidly as it had expected from the 100 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine that it purchased earlier this year, raising questions about whether it can keep to its aggressive schedule to vaccinate most Americans by late spring or early summer. Trump administration officials denied there would be availability issues in the second quarter, citing other vaccines in the pipeline. Kristi Noem hails South Dakota as a coronavirus success story using badly cherry-picked numbers27 via Aaron Blake of The Washington Post South Dakota Gov. Noem clearly harbors national political ambitions, keeping up a packed travel schedule even as her state deals with one of the worst, if not the worst, coronavirus outbreaks in the country. As cases in South Dakota began to rise in September, Noem posted a video making light of social distancing. But to hear Noem tell it in her new op-ed in the Journal, her state is some kind of a success story. Its the avoidance of strong mitigation measures, according to Noem, that has benefited its economy, and its problem isnt all that bad, relative to other states. First signs of Thanksgiving COVID-19 wave emerge28 via Reid Wilson of The Hill The first signs of a post-Thanksgiving surge in coronavirus cases are beginning to show up in data released by states across the country in a troubling prelude of what may become the deadliest month of the pandemic so far. Those hints of an uptick in case counts come as the country faces an already substantial wave of infections that began in the Upper Midwest and spread to every corner of the map as summer turned to fall and the weather cooled. The United States has averaged nearly 200,000 new confirmed cases a day over the last week. Cases have risen over the last week in 38 states and the District of Columbia. CORONA ECONOMICS Even with a COVID vaccine, U.S. economy will likely get worse before it gets better29 via Lizzy Gurdus of CNBC We still havent seen the storm before the calm. So says Alejandra Grindal, senior international economist at Ned Davis Research, despite the markets run to record highs, reignited by positive announcements around a COVID-19 vaccine. While a U.S. vaccine rollout would likely spark a bigger turnaround, the key will be getting through the next three months, Grindal said. Mass deployment of some sort of vaccine early on in Q2 or throughout Q2 of 2021 could fuel a pretty sharp recovery not only in U.S. economic activity, but also global economic activity due to pent-up demand, she said. The million-dollar question is how U.S. policy toward China might change when President-elect Biden takes office, but Grindal didnt expect a huge overhaul. Experts say the economy will take a while to recover, despite the imminent arrival of a COVID-19 vaccine. Image via Getty. Will there be second stimulus check before end of 2020?30 Via Kristina Peterson and Richard Rubin of The Wall Street Journal Its not out of the question yet. Democrats and a few Republicans are still pushing to add a second round of stimulus checks into any agreement this year. And before the election, Trump urged Congress to send him additional coronavirus aid that included another round of direct checks. Direct checks are an excellent way to get money into the hands of people who desperately need it, Sen. Elizabeth Warren said. President-elect Biden has said that any aid Congress passes this year will just be a down payment on additional help he hopes to pass in 2021, which could include another round of direct checks. But any package would still have to clear the Senate. MORE CORONA In Britain, a simple jab opens a new front in the coronavirus battle31 via Megan Specia of The New York Times It was a simple thing. A swipe with an alcohol pad, a tiny needle prick in the upper arm and the application of a small Band-Aid. But the health care workers receiving a new coronavirus vaccine here on Tuesday, among the first in Britain, know its more than that. It had been just six days since regulators in Britain announced emergency approval for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the first country to release a tested vaccine to the public. The start of the vaccination program for a virus that has infected tens of millions globally and claimed more than 1.5 million lives signals a new phase in battling the coronavirus in Britain, which has been hard hit by the illness.

COVID infections, and blame, rise along Southeast Asian borders32 via Hannah Beech of The New York Times The border between Thailand and Myanmar is more than 1,500 miles long, much of it thickly forested. Myanmar has suffered runaway transmission of the coronavirus. Thailand, so far, has not. But over the past couple of weeks, at least 19 COVID-19 cases in Thailand have been linked to migrant workers who slipped between the two countries undetected. The infections have spooked Thai officials, who have managed one of the worlds most successful coronavirus containment strategies. They are now racing to trace the contacts of hundreds of people who may have been exposed. And the events have cast a spotlight on how regions like Southeast Asia that depend on porous borders are fighting to keep the virus out while allowing economic activity to continue. Plastic surgeons say business is up, partly because clients dont like how they look on Zoom33 via Danielle Braff of The Washington Post Plastic surgeons across the globe are anecdotally reporting an unprecedented number of requests for procedures. It is unknown if this is pent-up demand from the months of shutdown when patients were not able to get their procedures, or increased interest because of other potential factors, said Adam Ross, spokesman for the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, adding that the organization would not have estimates for the number of procedures done this year until spring 2021. Jon Mendelsohn, medical director of Advanced Cosmetic Surgery amp38 Laser Center in Cincinnati, said injectable procedures such as Botox and fillers were up 90 compared with the same period last year. American and Spirit Airlines launch COVID-19 tests for flyers34 via David Lyons of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel American Airlines and Spirit Airlines are starting COVID-19 testing programs on Wednesday for passengers who are traveling from U.S. airports. The American initiative is a home-testing program to be operated with a company called LetsGetChecked, a direct-to-consumer, at-home health testing firm. Test results can be used for flights on or after Dec. 12, the airline said Tuesday. The offer comes less than a week after Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and Spirit announced they are partnering to make available coronavirus tests to all travelers who use the Broward County airport. The airline said testing is also available at other airports it serves including Boston, Hartford, LaGuardia in New York, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Newark, Oakland, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Seattle and Tampa. PRESIDENTIAL Supreme Court rejects bid to overturn Joe Bidens win in Pennsylvania35 via Josh Gerstein, Zach Montellaro, and Kyle Cheney of POLITICO The Supreme Court has rejected a bid by a Republican member of Congress and other GOP activists to overturn Bidens win in Pennsylvania. In a one-sentence order on Tuesday afternoon, the justices turned down the emergency request from Rep. Mike Kelly and two other House candidates to decertify the results of last months election in the Keystone State. The high court acted without comment or noted dissent in the matter on the last day under federal law for states to submit their slates of presidential electors without being subject to potential contest in Congress. Trump is likely to return to Florida and remain the most powerful Republican in the U.S.36 via David Smiley of the Miami Herald As Trumps last-ditch efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election fail, his actions and words are increasingly pointing to one likelihood When his presidency ends, Trump will return to South Florida and remain a force in Republican politics. If I lost, I would say, I lost. And Id go to Florida, Trump told a crowd of thousands Saturday in Georgia during a political rally on behalf of two Republican U.S. Senate candidates. And Id take it easy, and Id go around and Id say, I did a good job.

Greg Steube appears to acknowledge Biden victory in fundraising appeal37 via Jacob Ogles of Florida Politics U.S. Rep. Steube seemingly acknowledged Bidens victory in a new fundraising letter for Georgias Republican Senators. As Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler face January runoffs, the political world has turned its attention to Georgia. Steube, almost immediately after the election, began raising money for the Republican incumbents. But his most recent email more explicitly calls to Save The Senate and contains language explicitly discussing what Vice President-elect Kamala Harris might do when she presides over the Senate. We all have to if were going to hold the Senate and stop Kamala Harris from pushing through the most progressive legislative agenda in history to come before Congress, Steube wrote. Christopher Krebs, election security official fired by Trump, sues over threatening remarks made by a lawyer for the President38 via Ben Fox of The Associated Press The U.S. election and cybersecurity official who was fired last month by Trump filed a lawsuit Tuesday over threatening remarks by a lawyer for the President that prompted a wave of death threats. Krebs says in the suit that he has been bombarded with threats since Joseph diGenova appeared on Newsmax and called for Krebs to be killed. Amid the threats, Krebs, a Republican and Trump appointee, was forced to move out of his home in Virginia for several days and hire private security. He keeps his children from playing in their front yard out of fear, attorney Jim Walden said. It has fundamentally uprooted their lives, Walden said. He and his family feel terribly threatened. TRANSITION Safe harbor law locks Congress into accepting electoral votes cast for President-elect Biden39 via Mark Sherman of The Associated Press Happy Safe Harbor Day, America. Other than Wisconsin, every state appears to have met a deadline in federal law that essentially means Congress has to accept the electoral votes that will be cast next week. Those votes will elect Biden as the countrys next President. Its called a safe harbor provision because its a kind of insurance policy by which a state can lock in its electoral votes by finishing up certification of the results and any state court legal challenges by a congressionally imposed deadline, which this year is Tuesday. In 2020, that date is Dec. 14. But Congress also set another deadline, six days before electors meet, to insulate state results from being challenged in Congress. The 2020 election passes an important milestone, virtually guaranteeing that Joe Biden will assume the presidency in January. Key lines from the unveiling of Bidens health team40 via Kate Sullivan of CNN Politics Biden introduced top members of his health team on Tuesday and announced the teams key objectives when he takes office. Its a team of world-class experts at the top of their fields, crisis-tested, defined by a deep sense of duty, honor and patriotism. Already ready to jump in. Theyve been advising me, many of them, for a long time. And theyre going to get ready on day one to spare not a single effort to get this pandemic under control, he said at an event in Wilmington, Delaware. Biden said that in consultation with Dr. Anthony Fauci, his newly announced chief medical adviser, he has outlined three objectives for the team. First, for his initial 100 days in office, he will ask every American to wear a mask. Biden selects Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge for housing and Tom Vilsack for agriculture, sources say41 via Mary Clare Jalonick, Zeke Miller and Aamer Madhani of The Associated Press Biden has selected Ohio Rep. Fudge as his housing and urban development secretary and former Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack to reprise that role in his administration, according to five people familiar with the decisions. Fudge, a former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, was just elected to a seventh term representing a majority Black district that includes parts of Cleveland and Akron. Vilsack spent eight years as head of the U.S. Department of Agriculture during the Obama administration and served two terms as Iowa Governor. Biden sees Fudge as a leading voice for working families and a longtime champion of affordable housing, infrastructure and other priorities, according to one of the people familiar with the President-elects decision. Joe Biden taps Ohios Marcia Fudge as HUD Secretary. Mayor Pete Buttigieg may get China post42 via Hans Nichols of Axios Biden is considering a high-profile ambassadorship for Buttigieg, possibly sending him to China. The 38-year-old former Mayor of South Bend, Indiana, whom Biden has compared to his late son, Beau, played a key role in Bidens nomination. Letting him deepen his foreign policy chops could boost Buttigiegs future, since many inside the Democratic Party believe his return as a presidential candidate is a matter of when, not if. The Beijing post has often gone to experienced politicians, toward the middle or end of their careers, as a way to confer respect to the Chinese. A Buttigieg nomination would invert that model and give the Chinese an opportunity to get to know a potential future President. 2020 Bevy of Mayors backing Manny Diazs bid for FDP chair43 via Scott Powers of Florida Politics Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer, Tampa Mayor Jane Castor, and Miami-Dade County Mayor Levine Cava are among a bevy of municipal executives declaring endorsements for former Miami Mayor Manny Diaz to be the next chair of the Florida Democratic Party. Diazs campaign is announcing the bakers dozen of endorsements from current and former Florida Mayors as he works to lock up support from much of the partys establishment. Last Friday, he announced he has the backings of 26 current and former state lawmakers and local officials. Diaz is running to replace Terrie Rizzo, the Florida Democratic Partys current chair, who announced last week that she would not seek reelection to another term. In his bid for FDP chair, Manny Diaz racks up major endorsements from several Florida Mayors. Oscar Puig wins Doral City Council seat in runoff election44 via Joey Flechas and Samantha J. Gross of the Miami Herald Puig will be the next Doral Council member after he defeated Juan Carlos Esquivel in Tuesdays runoff election to fill Seat 3 on the city council. Puig, a 53-year-old real estate agent and longtime civic activist, carried the endorsement of the entire Doral council, led by Mayor Juan Carlos JC Bermudez. Bermudez won reelection himself in November. Esquivel, 54, a logistics professional, cast himself as an independent voice who would balance a commission. Puig and Esquivel won the most votes in the Novthree. 3 election, but neither captured the 50 plus one to win outright. Puig led the three-person race with about 44 while Esquivel won about 33. On Tuesday, Puig won office with about 68 of the vote. MATTERS House passes defense spending bill with veto-proof majority despite Trump opposition45 via Orion Rummler of Axios The House voted 335-78 on Tuesday to pass the National Defense Authorization Act NDAA, which authorizes a must-pass 740 million budget for defense spending. The vote was a veto-proof majority. But it remains unclear whether the same number of Republicans would vote to override a presidential veto. The large number of GOP votes shows how strong the bipartisan support is for this legislation, which has passed every year without fail for more than half a century. Trump has repeatedly foreshadowed a veto of the bill this year, demanding that Congress repeal a federal law that protects social media sites from legal liability. Judge dismisses Mike Flynn case following pardon from Trump46 via Eric Tucker of The Associated Press A federal judge on Tuesday dismissed the criminal case against former Trump administration national security adviser Flynn but pointedly noted that a pardon Flynn received from the President last month does not mean that he is innocent. The order from U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan was expected in light of the pardon from Trump that wiped away Flynns conviction for lying to the FBI during the Russia investigation. Sullivan acknowledged in his 43-page order that the Presidents broad pardon powers required dismissal and that the decision to pardon him is a political, rather than legal, one. Michael Flynn may have been pardoned, but a federal judge points out that it doesnt mean hes innocent. Image via AP. Florida launches strong case for Space Force Command47 via Jim Turner of The News Service of Florida Space Florida President and CEO Frank DiBello told the Enterprise Florida Board of Directors that Florida made a very strong case for the Patrick Air Force Base south of Cape Canaveral, which is one of six finalists for U.S. Space Command headquarters. Were already part of a support network for three combatant commands, DiBello said. Were one of the most military-friendly communities and a very military-friendly state. We have a very large number of active-duty reserve and guard personnel and military dependents and more than 68,000 veterans, which is a good 11 of our population. And thats indicative of the fact that this is a great place for a military facility to locate and to operate. STATEWIDE Nikki Fried Hemp lighting up Florida agriculture48 via News Service of Florida Hemp is blazing among Floridas agriculture inventory since it was first allowed to be legally grown in the Sunshine State in April, Agriculture Commissioner Fried said Tuesday. Fried said 22,078 acres are currently licensed for hemp, nearly equal to the acreage in Florida of tomatoes, watermelon and snap peas. I have projected that we are going to have seen, within the next three to five years, nearly 300,000 acres, which is about half what citrus is, Fried told members of the Enterprise Florida Board of Directors in a virtual call Tuesday morning. So, imagine all the citrus industry here in the state of Florida about 700,000 acres and so were going to be getting close to half that. hemp industry is turning heads, says Nikki Fried.

GOP lawyer resigns over treatment of Florida data analyst49 via Mary Ellen Klas of the TimesHerald Tallahassee Bureau A Sarasota lawyer resigned his appointment to the panel that picks judges on Tuesday to call attention to the way DeSantis has handled public access to truthful data and the raiding of a data analysts home. Ron Filipkowski, a Marine veteran, former state and federal prosecutor, and a lifelong Republican who was appointed to the 12th Circuit Judicial Nominating Commission by DeSantis resigned Tuesday morning after reviewing the search warrant affidavit the state used to seize computers and phones from Jones. Filipkowski, 52, who has served on the Judicial Nominating Commission for 10 years and was twice appointed to the role by former Gov. Rick Scott and once by DeSantis, called the Governors handling of the pandemic reckless and irresponsible.

This little community prevented parched Everglades areas from getting much-needed water Why thats about to change51 via Kimberly Miller of The Palm Beach Post An 8.5 square-mile community in South Florida has stymied Everglades restoration for years by blocking water flow to parched areas at the tip of the state, but new plans ranging in cost from 11 million to 100 million may soon change that. The South Florida Water Management District is looking at three potential projects that will allow water to sidle past the low-lying Las Palmas community in western Miami-Dade County to Everglades National Park without flooding homes and farms. With a new spillway completed in October that will double the flow of water released from an area north of the Tamiami Trail, the fix for Las Palmas is a top priority, district officials said.

School district seeks social media posts of Parkland victims families53 via Rafael Olmeda of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel They lost their children and their loved ones to violence when a disgruntled former student opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Valentines Day 2018, and now the Broward School District wants to know what these traumatized parents had to say on Facebook in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. Broward Circuit Judge Patti Englander Henning is being asked to order the victims families to turn over their social media posts as part of multiple lawsuits accusing the school district of negligence in the Parkland massacre. The district cited multiple lawsuits in which social media postings were considered relevant to civil claims, including lawsuits against cities, malpractice cases and foreclosures. As part of ongoing lawsuits, a Broward judge is ordering Parkland victims families to turn over their social media activity. Sea-level rise could flood thousands of Miamis affordable housing spots, research shows54 via Alex Harris and Yadira Lopez of the Miami Herald On Tuesday, the University of Miami debuted a new tool, funded by 500,000 in grants from JPMorgan Chase, to help community groups and politicians figure out how to keep affordable housing dry. It shows where all of Miami-Dade affordable housing defined for this effort as paid for or subsidized by the government is on a map, then layers on the expected flooding from sea level rise later in the century. In Miami-Dade, thats a little over two feet of sea rise by 2060. By that point, the research found, more than 2,300 affordable housing units will be at risk of flooding driven by sea-level rise. By 2070, that number jumps to nearly 4,000.

A Florida painting company shorted workers 55,000 in pay through overtime violations57 via David J. Neal of the Miami Herald A Lakeland company has paid 55,439 in earned overtime pay it hadnt paid employees before a U.S. Department of Labor investigation, the federal agency announced Monday. The back pay went to 71 workers at Universal Painting Corp., 780.83 per worker. Labor said a Wage and Hour Division investigation found that the company run since the 1990s by John Aldrich and Theresa Aldrich didnt count the time workers spent getting from job site to job site as work time. That exclusion sometimes kept hours worked under 40 per week, depriving workers of overtime pay they should have received. FDOT awards 67.3M for TECO Line Streetcar expansion and modernization project in Tampa58 via Veronica Brezina-Smith of the Tampa Bay Business Journal The TECO Line Streetcar System in Tampa will receive 67.3 million to financially support the long-anticipated project to extend the service line into the Tampa Heights neighborhood and upgrade the fleet. The Florida Department of Transportation funding, which was granted through the New Starts transit funding program, is the largest to be awarded to a Tampa Bay transit project. The current streetcar route runs along a 2.7-mile path from Ybor City to the Channel District. Transit funding has been the Tampa Bay areas Achilles heel, and Tampa Mayor Castor said this is a positive step for her Transforming Tampas Tomorrow initiative to get more people where they need to be using mass transit. TOP OPINION Two scenarios could derail trust in the vaccines. Heres how we must prepare for them.59 via Leana Wen of The Washington Post Heres one that will almost certainly occur A large number of people will experience side effects. In Phase 3 trials of both vaccines, 10 to 15 of participants reported significant noticeable symptoms. Some were self-reported to be severe and included fatigue, pain and swelling at the injection site, headache and muscle aches. Having side effects isnt a bad thing in fact, it signifies that the body is mounting an appropriate immune response. Then theres my second nightmare situation People will die of other causes, and the deaths will be wrongly attributed to the vaccine. There are ways to anticipate and mitigate this concern. In advance of mass vaccinations, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can provide baseline numbers for expected illness and death among nursing home residents. Vaccines must be trusted, and trust can be quickly eroded. OPINIONS Why wont DeSantis do more to promote COVID-19 vaccination?60 via Randy Schultz of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel Ohios plan to promote and distribute COVID-19 vaccines is 52 pages long. It includes such details as follow-up reminders for the second dose. Marylands plan also is ambitious. According to the Baltimore Sun, the state may use celebrities, faith leaders, and community messengers to encourage vaccinations. The state will use different approaches based on demographics. Meanwhile, in Florida, DeSantis plans mostly nothing. Compared to other Republican Governors, DeSantis remains a dangerous and frustrating outlier on the virus. He opposes restrictions on businesses, but widespread vaccinations will make more people comfortable with going to restaurants, movie theaters and theme parks. DeSantis also faces major challenges with the rollout. Not only is Florida the third-largest state, vaccination compliance already is low. How wary should Florida be of COVID-related lawsuit immunity?61 via the Tampa Bay Times editorial board Businesses cannot be expected to be instant experts on how to handle a new pandemic. COVID-19 was unfamiliar, and the protocols for containing the spread changed. Businesses that act in good faith should not be held to an unreasonable standard of conduct. No one wants a rash of frivolous lawsuits from diners suing restaurants that acted responsibly and followed state rules. Nothing is risk-free and each of us needs to take personal responsibility for our actions, which includes choosing to eat out during a pandemic. But businesses should not get a free pass. Some will put profits before people, defying even basic protocols and common sense. The courts should be left to resolve those cases. Florida candidates increasingly skip debates, forums. A tactic for the cowardly and unprepared that sometimes works62 via Scott Maxwell of the Orlando Sentinel Have you noticed its getting harder to find politicians willing to give you straight answers, or sometimes any kind of answers at all? Well, thats not by accident. The Tampa Bay Times reported last week that a political consultant in that region advises his clients to avoid candidate forums, knowing they might screw up if asked to think and speak for themselves in public. I agree that debate-ducking is a good strategy for certain kinds of candidates particularly stupid ones. Forum-skipping is also a smart idea for cowards. And anyone whos been recently arrested. Also, those whove reneged on past campaign promises, served as puppets for special interests, or have generally cruddy voting records. ON TODAYS SUNRISE Gov.

A Christmas star will light up the sky this month for the first time in 800 years65 via Amber Randall of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel A rare Christmas star will light up the sky at the start of this months winter solstice, a shiny beacon that will be visible from South Florida without a telescope. Its a planetary alignment that last happened in the year 1226, according to Rice University astronomer Patrick Hartigan. As they make their orbit around the sun, Jupiter and Saturn will slowly grow closer together over the next two weeks until they are almost completely aligned, according to NASA. When they align this closely, the two planets will appear to form a single bright star, also known as the Christmas Star.

As state Department of Environmental Protection officials confirmed a second breach in a pond at the Piney Point industrial site5, both the federal Environmental Protection Agency and Army Corps of Engineers deployed greater infrastructure to the site. To catch up after a long weekend at Piney Point, officials late last week sounded alarms over water coming out of one of three water stacks at the abandoned phosphorous mine. On Saturday, county officials announced the evacuation of more than 300 homes out of concern a collapse of the mine would bring flash floods with 20-foot water walls. DeSantis declared a state of emergency on Saturday as DEP officials pumped water from the stack directly into Tampa Bay. Point has been a disaster-in-the-making for some time.Officials pushed back on concerns the water could have excessive radiation but said it indeed contains high levels of phosphorous and nitrogen and high pH levels. All that could mean algal blooms in the Bay and beyond, and U.S. Rep. Vern Buchanan reported after an aerial flight above the site Monday he worried he could already see algae gathering. After flying over the area threatened by the leak of contaminated wastewater at Piney Point, its clear that a breach of the reservoir would have catastrophic consequences, Buchanan said. The path of floodwaters resulting from a rupture would affect homes, businesses, farmland, Tampa Bay and Bishop Harbor. Meanwhile, state Sen. Jim Boyd on Monday filed a budget amendment to fund the complete cleanup and closure of phosphogypsum stacks on site. Senate President Wilton Simpson expressed his support for funding after visiting the site. We dont want to be talking about this problem again in 5, 10, or 20 years, Simpson said. This is exactly the kind of long-standing infrastructure issue we need to address with the nonrecurring federal funds our state will receive from the American Rescue Plan.

Florida officials say theyre ready to use emergency funds to resolve the longstanding issue of contaminated water at the former phosphate plant whose breached pond threatens to flood nearby homes with contaminated water. Manatee Parks Director Charlie Hunsicker, in a memo to Acting Manatee Administrator Scott Hopes, said Florida had authorized the use of emergency funds. That would allow Manatee County to pay for the planning and construction of a deep well, according to the memo. Its not clear yet much a well would cost. Senate proposes 200 million for Piney Point cleanup and closure10 via Lawrence Mower of the Tampa Bay Times  The leader of Floridas Senate wants to spend 200 million on the complete cleanup and closure of the former Piney Point phosphate plant Senate President Simpson announced that he wants to spend federal pandemic relief dollars on the site before the Legislature finalizes its budget this month.

They now want a more permanent solution. It needs to be handled, and the water needs to be removed, and unfortunately, its just a bad situation all around, said Jennifer Amares, owner of Popis Place III along US 41. On Sunday, DeSantis made his way to Manatee County to give an update on whats been done to stop the leak. He said their first priority is to mitigate the situation at hand.

DeSantis first reshaped Floridas highest court13 via John Kennedy of the Sarasota Herald-Tribune  The biggest items on DeSantis wish list are being roundly attacked as unconstitutional  although his tough penalties for protesters, new demands on social media platforms and voting overhaul look certain to clear the Republican-led Legislature. A long legal siege will likely follow, with opponents already outlining lawsuit strategies. But DeSantis has reshaped the states highest court, where his hand-picked jurists from the conservative Federalist Society are expected to side with him. Or will they? DeSantis shaped the Florida Supreme Court to tilt further right.

After negotiations between the Governors Office, the Speaker, and the Senate President, the plan came together, sources familiar with the discussions told Florida Politics. An amendment filed Monday afternoon to the Senates version of the deal SB 2512 would add about 60 million to what lawmakers initially agreed to allocate for affordable housing for the coming fiscal year. Lawmakers consider budget, await revenue data15 via The Associated Press  Both chambers of the Florida Legislature will take up their respective budget proposals during floor sessions this week, as they now begin racing the clock to deliver a balanced budget for the Governors consideration. Just four weeks remain before lawmakers end their two-month session, and much of the work ahead will depend on the latest state revenue projections, which are expected to be released Tuesday. Last summer, state economists projected a revenue downturn of 5.4 billion over two years, but rosier December data prompted the shortfall to be adjusted downward to 3.3 billion. State officials are hopeful that the newest numbers will help relieve some of the anxiety over the states finances. House budget would roll back virtual school choice16 via Drew Wilson of Florida Politics  A budget bill in the House has the potential to end many virtual school options and funnel students into Florida Virtual School. Current law requires school districts to offer at least three virtual school options to students within their district, though the statute also allows out-of-district students to enroll with no limit on the number of out-of-district students who could enroll. Essentially, the law allows a county school district to set up a statewide virtual school. Only a handful of school districts have done so, and most of them are large districts, such as Duval and Hillsborough. But a couple of small school districts have entered the field. The most notable is Hendry County. House to take up online tax plan17 via News Service of Florida  After House and Senate leaders reached agreement on the issue, the House next week could pass a plan that would require out-of-state online retailers to collect sales taxes on items sold to Floridians. The House is scheduled Wednesday to take up the proposal HB 15, which comes after years of Florida businesses lobbying to require out-of-state retailers to collect and remit the taxes. Under an agreement reached by Sprowls and Simpson, additional revenue initially would be used to replenish the states unemployment compensation trust fund and eventually would be used to offset a cut in a commercial rent tax. If the House approves the plan next week, it would have to go back to the Senate for a final vote.  TALLY 2  Florida election bills wont bow to cancel culture18 via Haley Brown of Florida Politics  A proposed change to Florida voting laws, still winding its way through the legislative process, mirrors some of the provisions in new voting law passed in Georgia. The Georgia voting laws have been rife up critics, starting with Democrats and voting rights groups and, most recently, large corporations who have waded into the matter. The similarities raise questions about whether Floridas proposals could hurt the states economy, as has been seen as a potential unintended consequence in Georgia. After saying the 2020 election went smoothly, Floridas Republican-led legislature has been moving forward with a measure supporters say will tighten election security.

Ocoee Democratic Rep. Kamia Brown has sought to change that since taking office in 2016, and this year shes gained a powerful ally House Speaker Chris Sprowls. If it wasnt for the hard work that Brown has done to pave the path for this, the work that we have been able to do here today would not be possible, said Sprowls. Sprowls, along with Brown and a bipartisan group of House members, unveiled a plan to extend Medicaid coverage for pregnant women by 10 months, from the current two months after a child is born to a full year of coverage. extending Medicaid to pregnant women, Kamia Brown has found a powerful ally.

As reported by Andrew Atterbury of POLITICO Florida, the private schools are pushing back against a bill HB 419 containing a slate of accountability standards and a move to close the Office of Early Learning and replace it with a Division of Early Learning within the state Department of Education. I know its important that we ensure that state and federal dollars are being spent wisely, but this amount of regulation and oversight puts a strain on small providers to stay in business, Lori Thieme, associate superintendent of Early Childhood Education with the Florida Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, told the House Education Appropriations Subcommittee last week. Police, firefighters could be exempted from union dues bill20 via News Service of Florida  Unions representing law-enforcement officers and firefighters could be exempted from a controversial Senate proposal that would place new requirements on union dues paid by government employees. The Senate Rules Committee is slated Tuesday to take up the proposal SB 7821, which has drawn fierce opposition from unions. But a proposed amendment filed by bill sponsor Ray Rodrigues, an Estero Republican, would exempt unions representing law enforcement officers and firefighters from the requirements. If the amendment is approved Tuesday, the bill will continue to apply to unions, such as the Florida Education Association teachers union, that have long been major supporters of Democratic political candidates. A power grab Or freedom? Florida home businesses bill divides state and local officials22 via Daniel Rivero of WLRN  Every time the Florida Legislature goes into Session, Miami-Dade County Commissioner Joe Martinez says he has to prepare himself mentally. Its something he says half-jokingly, but also half-seriously. I crawl into a bathtub in the fetal position and wait for the Legislature to end and come out and see the aftermath of whats the collateral damage that they have done, he told WLRN. His frustration with the Legislature is because every year, he said, Tallahassee chips away at the rights of local government. That frustration recently bubbled over into two resolutions Martinez sponsored in the Miami-Dade Commission, opposing bills that have been introduced in the Florida Senate. 8216Moment of silence bill moves through Legislature23 via Hope Dean of Fresh Take Florida news service  Floridas Legislature is on the verge of requiring public schools across the state to set aside one to two minutes of silence every morning, adding to the mix of school announcements, the Pledge of Allegiance and roll calls. The House passed HB 529 last month on a 94-24 vote, and a similar bill is making its way through the Senate. In the House, the 24 opponents included 23 Democrats plus Republican Rep. Linda Chaney of St. Petersburg. Under the proposal, which would cover all K-12 public school classrooms, teachers cannot recommend what students do with that time but should encourage parents to have that conversation with their children. Chaney was the sole Republican to oppose the moment of silence bill.

The House unanimously passed the bill HB 6511 Thursday, bringing the family of Crystle Marie Galloway one step closer to full relief from a 2019 lawsuit. The legislation is sponsored by Indian Rocks Beach Republican Rep. Nick DiCeglie. The Senate Rules Committee will take up its version of the bill SB 26, sponsored by Tampa Democratic Sen. Janet Cruz, Tuesday. The bill stems from a lawsuit filed by Galloways mother, Nicole Black.

TALLY 3  Meet the young, Black legislators fighting to protect democracy In Florida and Georgia25 via Anoa Changa of NewsOne  In Florida, a new trifecta is making its voice heard in the statehouse. Reps. Angie Nixon, Travaris McCurdy, and Michele K. Rayner-Goolsby left it all on the House floor last week during the debate on HB 1. The House debated the anti-protest bill backed by DeSantis for close to five hours before its passage. All newly elected representatives, the trifecta did not mince words on the harmful impact on communities traditionally seeking justice. Some of our greatest moments in this nation are rooted in protest, Nixon exclaimed. This bill is designed to keep us fearful. To keep us in check. McCurdy, Michele K. Rayner-Goolsby and Angie Nixon are making their voices heard in the House.Halfway into Session, Palm Beach County lawmakers push bills in desolate Capitol26 via Christine Stapleton of The Palm Beach Post  Halfway through the Florida Legislatures annual 60-day session, Palm Beach County lawmakers have come to terms with doing the routine business of getting their bills passed and crafting a state budget amid desolate hallways that should be teeming with lobbyists, aides, journalists and staff. Its weird, eerie, said state Rep. Matt Willhite. Still, Willhite, who has sponsored or co-sponsored 76 bills, has seen some success. Four of his bills have already passed through committee in the Republican-dominated Legislature and are on the House floor awaiting a final vote. Florida Education Association ad campaign targets teacher paycheck protection bill27 via Renzo Downey of Florida Politics  The Florida Education Association is launching a digital ad campaign to stir opposition to legislation teachers say would weaken their unions. With four 30-second ads released Monday, FEA targets that legislation SB 1014HB 835, carried by Sen. Dennis Baxley in the Senate. The Ocala Republican calls the bill a paycheck protection effort. The Senate bill, named directly in the ads, would prevent unions from deducting dues from teachers paychecks and require teachers to reaffirm each year that they arent required to be union members. The ads feature three teachers arguing the proposal would take away teachers personal freedoms and their ability to advocate for their students. Realtors stake new PAC with 3M  The Florida Realtors has placed 3 million into a new political committee as lawmakers consider changes to the states affordable housing trust fund, Matt Dixon of POLITICO Florida reports. The trade group is against the proposed changes, which would send two-thirds of affordable housing dollars to other programs, but says the new committee, Floridians for Housing, is not an explicit response to the proposal. We are just keeping our options open at this time, said Tom Butler, the groups spokesperson. Reports filed with the state Division of Elections show the committees lone contribution is from the Florida Realtors. It has not yet reported any spending. Bucs wideout backs anti-tethering bill  Tampa Bay wide receiver Chris Godwin sent a letter to Rep. Wyman Duggan on Monday expressing support for a bill that would prohibit leaving dogs tethered outdoors alone, including during severe weather such as hurricanes. Godwin sent the pro-HB 177 letter on behalf of PETA. This vital piece of legislation would save the lives of countless vulnerable animals and reduce the need for kind, caring people to risk their own lives rescuing animals in dangerous weather conditions, writes Godwin, who is the proud guardian of two dogs and founded an organization with his fiancee to help at-risk dogs. He concludes by asking Duggan to schedule HB 177 for a hearing in the Civil Justice amp38 Property Rights Subcommittee he chairs.  LEG.

DeSantis, who has been subpoenaed in the case to testify at a possible trial, would not consent to a so-called diversion offer, Collier County prosecutor Deborah Cunningham wrote in an email. The defendant wrote a letter of apology to the Governor, his defense lawyer said. Such diversion programs generally free courts to focus on more serious crimes, and allow less serious offenders to avoid prosecution and a criminal conviction. DeSantis is showing no mercy to the guy who hacked his voter file.

Tharina Oris, an 18-year-old UCF student who inspired her peers in Naples last May when she became one of the youngest organizers in the community following the death of George Floyd, says she is trying not to get too hung up on the verdict of the Chauvin trial.

Rural leaders worry about devastating prison closures30 via Dara Kam of News Service of Florida  A plan to shutter up to four state prisons is alarming officials in Floridas rural regions where correctional institutions have played an outsized role in providing jobs and supporting businesses for decades. Simpsons proposal to consolidate prisons and demolish four facilities drew bipartisan pushback when it was released recently. Simpson has defended consolidation and closures, saying the plan is designed to resuscitate a prison system in crisis. But local officials say the closures could have a devastating impact in rural counties. You could literally kill a community overnight by closing a prison if its in the right location. Youre talking about generational changes that would affect our citizens, said Levy County Commissioner John Meeks, chairman of the Small County Coalition.

Feds roll out new flood insurance rates. 1 million in Florida will pay more32 via Alex Harris of the Bradenton Herald The good news is, most will see increases of less than 120 a year.

The National Flood Insurance Program, which underwrites most flood insurance policies in the U.S., is changing the way it calculates what each property has to pay. The new strategy, called Risk Rating 2.0, is meant to help pull the program out of its 20 billion debt and encourage people to live in safer, less flood-prone homes. Supreme Court to hear challenge to insurance law33 via Jim Saunders of News Service of Florida  The Florida Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear a constitutional challenge to a 2016 state law that put new requirements on life-insurance companies to determine whether policyholders have died and to contact beneficiaries. Four insurers went to the Supreme Court last year after a divided 1st District Court of Appeal upheld the law. The Supreme Court issued an order Monday saying it would take up the dispute, though it did not set a date for oral arguments.

Pasco County ends its mask order54 via Barbara Behrendt of the Tampa Bay Times  With the number of vaccinations rising and hospital admissions related to COVID-19 declining, Pasco county administrator Dan Biles on Monday ended the countys mask mandate. Pasco officials still recommend that citizens use masks in indoor spaces where social distancing isnt possible, but the county will no longer require them. Face coverings are still required on all Pasco County Public Transportation buses per TSA requirements. Additionally, the lifting of the order does not apply to entities outside the Pasco County Commissions control, including schools and courthouses. The mask mandate had been the topic of much public comment at recent Pasco commission meetings, but a majority of Commissioners have refused to vote the requirement down. City of Sarasota votes to resurrect mask mandate55 via Timothy Fanning of the Sarasota Herald-Tribune  After failing twice to resurrect the citys emergency mask ordinance since Commissioners allowed it to sunset on Feb. 25, a majority of Commissioners voted 3-2 to begin the process of reinstating it. The decision comes as City Manager Marlon Brown said he will not enforce the mask mandate. The motion was to ask the city attorney to craft the ordinance. In order for it to become law, Commissioners need to approve an ordinance two more times. Jerry Demings hopes to lift Orange Countys mask mandate by June56 via Scott Powers of Florida Politics  Demings said he hopes to be able to lift his mask mandate for businesses within a month or two, but thats contingent on COVID-19 spread. Demings suggested he might consider lifting the mask mandate once more than 50 of the countys population is vaccinated, provided there are no new surges. But he noted the South African variants arrival in the county as another potential complication for returning to normal soon. Both Demings and Alvina Chu pushed for continued pandemic precautions, including mask-wearing, social distancing, and avoidance of crowds, until more progress is made toward widespread vaccinations. Demings is considering removing Orange Countys mask mandate in the next few months.Anti-mask West Melbourne bar owner charged with hosting illegal all-male strip show57 via Tyler Vazquez of Florida Today  West Melbourne police say a host of city ordinances regulating adult entertainment were violated Thursday night during an all-male revue they raided at Westside Sports Bar amp38 Grill. Undercover agents with body cameras attended the male strip show at 3026 W. New Haven Drive on Thursday night. The bars owner, 31-year-old Gary Kirby, is accused of knowingly and illegally operating the strip show after being cautioned by police in the past. Flyers advertising the show on Facebook invited attendees to come to the male revue featuring the Men of Utopia and touted glamour shots of muscular-looking performers who were expected to be dancing at the venue. During the performance, the dancers reportedly violated various city rules against giving lap dances.  CORONA NATION  A record 4 million people in U.S. received a vaccine on Saturday58 via Erin Cunningham,Joanna Slater, Brittany Shammas and Karin Brulliard of The Washington Post  More than four million people in the United States received a coronavirus vaccine on Saturday, the nations highest one-day total since the shots began rolling out in December, amid a rising caseload and increase in hospitalizations. An average of 3.1 million shots were administered each day over the past seven days, and nearly 1 in 4 adults is now fully vaccinated, said Andy Slavitt, the White Houses senior adviser for COVID-19 response, speaking at a news briefing. Are we entering a fourth wave of the pandemic? Experts disagree.59 via Reis Thebault of The Washington Post  After weeks of decline, the average number of new coronavirus infections reported each day is higher than its been in a month. The number of people in hospitals with COVID-19 has been stubbornly stagnant since mid-March. And even as highly contagious virus variants spread, state leaders are relaxing safety precautions. By now, this is a familiar script. But this time around, the countrys leading epidemiologists disagree about what to call this latest phase of the pandemic.

Or are we instead seeing the last gasps of a crisis in its 14th month? head Rochelle Walensky and Joe Biden urge Americans to not let their guard down. Image via AP.How close are states to herd immunity?60 via Philip Bump of The Washington Post The United States will at some point achieve herd immunity, the point at which enough people are immune to the coronavirus that it cant easily spread from person to person. That eventuality will happen in one of two ways Enough people will be vaccinated against the virus that it wont be able to find a new host when traveling around with an infected person, or enough people will be immune to that particular iteration of the virus after having already been infected with it that the virus is similarly stymied. The that particular iteration qualifier is important, of course The more the virus spreads, the more it might mutate into a form against which previously infected individuals dont have any protection. But were not yet terribly close. United States spent 162 million on remdesivir development but holds no patents, review finds61 via Christopher Rowland of The Washington Post  A new government report says the United States spent 162 million getting Gileads COVID-19 drug remdesivir to market but opted against seeking government patents because Gilead invented the experimental medicine years earlier. The drug sells for 3,120 for a five-day course of treatment for COVID-19. It brought in 2.8 billion in revenue for Gilead last year, and the company expects to make a similar amount in 2020. The largest share of the 162 million was for clinical trials after the coronavirus outbreak began last year. remdesivir does not significantly prevent COVID-19 deaths, but it has shortened hospital stays to 11 days from 15. Efforts to contain the coronavirus pandemic didnt have the death toll Donald Trump seemed to predict62 via Philip Bump of The Washington Post  At a White House coronavirus briefing in late March 2020, a reporter asked Anthony Fauci, the countrys top infectious-disease expert, to evaluate warnings by Trump about the toll of closing businesses to halt the spread of the virus. Dr. Fauci, could you speak to that  the idea that there might be mental health and suicide related to this? the reporter asked. Instead of deferring to Fauci, Trump handled the question himself. Much of Trumps rhetoric at the time was centered on the idea that the restrictions on economic activity that hed briefly endorsed could and should be set aside. Anthony Fauci pushes back on GOP criticisms, calling claims bizarre63 via Paulina Villegas of The Washington Post  Facing criticism from several high-profile Republicans in recent weeks, Fauci pushed back on some of the claims, calling the remarks bizarre. The most recent slight came Friday from Sen. Lindsey Graham. Graham claimed thousands of Central American migrants are spreading the virus while being detained in overcrowded facilities. Homeland Security officials have said all migrants brought into Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody are tested and, when needed, isolated or quarantined. Anthony Fauci Federal government wont require COVID vaccine passports64 via Ivana Saric of Axios  The federal government will not mandate the use of vaccine passports for travelers or businesses post-pandemic, Fauci said Monday. I doubt that the federal government will be the main mover of a vaccine passport concept, said Fauci. They may be involved in making sure things are done fairly and equitably, but I doubt if the federal government is going to be the leading element of that. Passports showing proof of vaccination could speed up international travel re-openings, but the idea of requiring immunization credentials has become a point of contention, particularly among Republican officials.

Walgreens not following U.S. guidance on Pfizer vaccine spacing66 via Rebecca Robbins of The New York Times  Walgreens has not been following guidance from federal health officials about the timing of second doses. People are supposed to get two doses three weeks apart. Walgreens, however, separated them by four weeks because that made it faster and simpler for the company to schedule appointments. There is no evidence that separating the doses by an extra week decreases the vaccines effectiveness. Now Walgreens is changing its system. Starting as soon as the end of the week, the pharmacy will automatically schedule people for Pfizer doses three weeks apart.  CORONA ECONOMICS  Norwegian Cruise Line pitches plan to CDC with required vaccinations to restart sailing67 via Richard Tribou of the Orlando Sentinel  Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings announced Monday it plans to require vaccinations for all guests and crew in a letter to the CDC in which it looks to have the CDCs conditional sail order lifted and allow the line to start starting in July. The letter follows updated guidance released Friday from the CDC to cruise lines on how to move forward to resume business under its current conditional sail order that has been in place since fall, an order that features 74 points that the lines will have to satisfy before being allowed to sail from U.S. ports with paying customers. That order is in effect until Nov. 1, 2021. Cruise Line is planning to resume sailing as long as all guests and crew are vaccinated.Port Canaveral CEO disappointed by what he says is vague CDC guidance for cruise return68 via Dave Berman of Florida Today  The CDC late Friday issued its next phase of technical guidance under its framework for conditional sailing order for cruise lines. But it remains unclear when cruises actually will be able to resume. Port Canaveral CEO John Murray said he is disappointed that this guidance for the cruise industry appears to be nothing more than an incremental step in a far-reaching process to resume passenger sailings in the U.S., with no definitive or target start date. The latest phase of the order requires cruise lines to establish agreements at ports where they intend to operate implement routine testing of the crew, and develop plans incorporating vaccination strategies to reduce the risk of introduction and spread of COVID-19 by crew and passengers During a turbulent COVID-pandemic year, outdoor recreation surged like never before69 via Patrick Connolly of the Orlando Sentinel  I need to put in another order for life jackets, cause Im almost wiped out, said Mike Chadwick, the owner of Ski World Orlando, to the person on the other end of the phone.

Like other shops selling outdoor recreation gear, Chadwick has been short on inventory, with manufacturers facing supply chain disruptions, while his shop has experienced a huge wave of demand.

While such protocols may be reassuring to an anxious populace, they are not necessary, says revised guidance issued on Monday by the CDC. It is possible for people to be infected through contact with contaminated surfaces or objects fomites, but the risk is generally considered to be low, the new CDC guidance says, estimating that the chance of contracting the coronavirus through surface transmission is lower than 1 in 10,000.

As Biden presses a fresh multitrillion-dollar proposal to spend new tax revenue on manufacturing, infrastructure and health care, the president and his party are poised once again to completely sidestep Senate Republicans who Biden long argued he could work with.

EPILOGUE TRUMP  8216The 45th Why Donald Trump is abandoning his iconic brand for a number78 via Alex Seitz-Wald of NBC News  Trump spent a lifetime putting his name on everything from steaks to skyscrapers to stimulus checks, but now, the former president appears to be replacing the gold-plated surname with a number 45. Last week, the 45th president launched his new official website, 45Office.com, a URL unlike those of his predecessors, who used their names for their web addresses. Several supporters have even submitted trademark applications to the U.S. Patent Office for 45-branded apparel, although Trump hasnt been one of them  yet. People who think a lot about corporate and political branding say its unlikely that he made the decision lightly. How Trump steered supporters into unwitting donations79 via Shane Goldmacher of The New York Times  Contributors had to wade through a fine-print disclaimer and manually uncheck a box to opt-out of recurring donations. As the election neared, the Trump team made that disclaimer increasingly opaque. It introduced a second prechecked box, known internally as a money bomb, that doubled a persons contribution. Eventually, its solicitations featured lines of text in bold and capital letters that overwhelmed the opt-out language. The tactic ensnared scores of unsuspecting Trump loyalists. Soon, banks and credit card companies were inundated with fraud complaints from the presidents own supporters. Trump supporters learned the hard way to read the fine print.Supreme Court dismisses case over Trump and Twitter critics80 via Mark Sherman of The Associated Press  The Supreme Court on Monday dismissed a case over Trumps efforts to block critics from his personal Twitter account. The court said there was nothing left to the case after Trump was permanently suspended from Twitter and ended his presidential term in January. Twitter banned Trump two days after the deadly attack on The Capitol by Trump supporters on Jan. 6. The company said its decision was due to the risk of further incitement of violence. The court also formally threw out an appeals court ruling that found Trump violated the First Amendment whenever he blocked a critic to silence a viewpoint.

It allows people to request a greeting from Trump for your special occasion. Theres a drop-down menu of occasions. There are no prices listed for a Trump greeting. Talk of a Trump presidential library has some open records watchdogs wary82 via Christine Stapleton and Antonio Fins of The Palm Beach Post  A new question has been added to the who, what, where and when already raised about a presidential library for former President Trump. Should Trump be entrusted with a presidential library? And if so, who should be in charge of telling the story of the Trump presidency? Trump tore up or destroyed documents while at his Mar-a-Lago club. Trump also took measures to restrict records of his historic, private discussions with world leaders. I think the risk that he would use that kind of institution to perpetuate lies and untruths is so harmful to our democracy, said Anne Weismann, who litigated Freedom of Information Act and presidential records laws. Conservatives try to commandeer The Big Lie83 via Aaron Blake of The Washington Post  In the weeks after the 2016 election, we were all trying to explain how Trump had, somehow, narrowly won the presidency. And one phrase that had cropped up just before the election was suddenly on the lips of many analysts fake news. Deliberate election disinformation from dubious websites had infected social media platforms. Some studies even suggested it might have swung the election. Given that last narrative, Trump and his supporters quickly sprung into action. They commandeered the term, twisting it to refer to something else entirely. Suddenly, it was used to describe media reports and media figures with who they disagreed. Ex-Trump spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany selling Tampa house84 via Emily L.

GAETZGATE  Whats a more Matt Gaetz way to respond to scandal than to double down? Facing growing accusations he may have traded cash or gifts for sex with a 17-year-old girl, the Panhandle Republican vowed not to resign85 his seat in Congress and continued to deny allegations. In an op-ed published by the conservative Washington Examiner86, Gaetz wrote, the swamp is out to drown me. But he vowed not to give up the fight. To this point, there are exactly zero credible or even noncredible accusers willing to come forward by name and state on the public record that I behaved improperly toward them, in the manner by which Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomohas 10 accusers. Gaetz is doubling down, to the surprise of no one. Image via Reuters.Yet sources in the Justice Department have confirmed to multiple outlets that investigators are looking whether he committed sex trafficking. That stems from an investigation of former Seminole County Tax Collector and Gaetz ally Joel Greenberg, who faces a similar charge among many others. Last week in The New York Times, a report said Gaetz and Greenberg had sex with the same underage girl, who also reportedly had sex with a third still-unnamed person involved in Florida GOP politics. The Daily Mail87 quoted a source close to the investigation that said Greenberg was singing to the feds and that the girl in question testified in front of a grand jury already about sleeping with the Republican Congressman. Meanwhile, politicos in the Panhandle wont wait for a resignation to prep for a special election. Theres already speculation such figures as state Rep. Alex Andrade, former state Rep. Frank White or Gaetz adversary Chris Dosev will mound GOP bids in a hypothetical race to replace Gaetz. Floridas Trump country stands with Gaetz88 via Gary Fineout of POLITICO  Most well-known Republicans are doing their best to avoid Gaetz, but not conservatives in his ruby-red district in Floridas Panhandle. I believe this is nothing more than fake news, said Larry Hetu, a Gulf Breeze activist who is part of a group trying to get a local bridge renamed after Trump. John Roberts, the Escambia County Republican Partys chair, said he would never condone anyone having sex with someone underage. But he added that so far, I havent heard anything concrete. Gaetzs accused extorter confirms, denies 25 million shakedown89 via William Bredderman and Justin Baragona of the Daily Beast  Bob Kent, the man Rep. Gaetz has accused of trying to extort millions from his family admitted in a bizarre interview Monday to asking the Florida Republicans dad to finance an international plot to rescue an American citizen widely believed to be dead in Iran. Kent said he was aware at the time that Gaetz might have legal issues and that he suggested that assisting in the mission would create good will toward the congressman. Kent maintained he had not sought to extort the Gaetz clan. Former lawmaker says Gaetz fought revenge porn law He thought that any picture was his to use as he wanted90 via Jason Garia of the Orlando Sentinel  While serving in the Florida Legislature, U.S. Rep. Gaetz opposed a bill meant to stop people from sharing sexually explicit images of their ex-lovers because Gaetz believed that recipients of those images had a right to share them, according to the sponsor of the legislation. Former state Rep. Tom Goodson, a Republican from Brevard County, spent three years sponsoring legislation to outlaw nonconsensual pornography, sometimes called revenge porn. Goodson said Monday that Gaetz was the chief opponent to that legislation. Former Rep. Katie Hill says Gaetz should resign if there is even a fraction of truth to allegations91 via Nick Niedzwiadek of POLITICO  In recent days, Gaetz has faced reports that the Department of Justice is looking into him over an alleged sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl and potential violations of sex trafficking laws, as part of a broader investigation. Gaetz has also reportedly shown off naked photos and videos of women in his life to other Congress members and was reminded by former House Speaker Paul Ryans office about the need for professional behavior. If there is even a fraction of truth to these reports, he should resign immediately, Hill wrote in Vanity Fair. Gaetz has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and been vocal in his own defense. Gaetzs national fan base awaits probe developments92 via Scott Powers of Florida Politics This should not happen more than once93 via Alexandra Petri of The Washington Post  There are several details of the Gaetz story that keep sticking in my head, but the one that sticks in it most is the report that he used to wander around and show his colleagues nude photos of people he had slept with. To me, this is something you do, ideally, zero times. You never experience the impulse to do it. But we can probably suppose that this is not what happened. The moments when people make up their secret minds about what is normal and what is acceptable are never big. They are always in private, when no one can see that you have failed the test, when all you were doing was trying to avoid any discomfort, be cool, play along. But there is a price.  CRISIS  Half of Republicans believe false accounts of deadly U.S. Capitol riot94 via James Oliphant and Chris Kahn of Reuters  Since the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, Trump and his Republican allies have pushed false and misleading accounts to downplay the event that left five dead and scores of others wounded. His supporters appear to have listened. About half of Republicans believe the siege was largely a nonviolent protest or was the handiwork of left-wing activists trying to make Trump look bad, a new ReutersIpsos poll has found. Six in 10 Republicans also believe the false claim put out by Trump that Novembers presidential election was stolen from him due to widespread voter fraud, and the same proportion of Republicans think he should run again in 2024, the March 30-31 poll showed. of Republicans believe The Capitol protest was mostly peaceful.

Federal authorities said Michael Lee Hardin entered the building with hundreds of other pro-Trump rioters and posed for a picture in The Capitol Crypt, then bragged about his actions in text messages with friends and family. Hardin, who served on the police force for nearly two decades before retiring in 2017, is charged with knowingly entering or remaining in a restricted building, disorderly conduct, and parading, demonstrating or picketing in a Capitol building. Does the FBI have the right culture to fight domestic terrorism?96 via Chuck Rosenberg for The Washington Post  After the Jan. 6 riots, FBI director Christopher Wray proclaimed that a situational information report produced in the FBIs Norfolk field office warning of possible violence was transmitted to The Capitol Police on Jan. 5, one day before the riot. The FBI also posted it to a law enforcement Web portal and briefed it to partners. Though the FBI suggests this is good and timely intelligence sharing, I disagree. If smoke were coming from a neighbors house, I would bang on their front door and call 911. They would be properly dismayed if I emailed them a situational information report and posted my concerns on a neighborhood blog. I would have failed them, their house reduced to cinders.  D.C.

Briant Coleman, the universitys former associate vice president for strategic initiatives, said in the suit that another administrator manufactured a report based on anonymous tips and accusations that ultimately was used as a basis for terminating him. Coleman seeks compensation of more than 100,000 from the university, plus the payment of his attorney fees. 38utm_mediumdig_displamp38utm_campaigncapd_fl21amp38utm_content600x300  TOP OPINION  Georgias racist voting law, not Coke or Delta, is the problem, Rubio  so are you110 via the Miami Herald editorial board  Rubio lashed out at Delta and Coca-Cola for daring, finally, to speak out against the restrictive Georgia law that makes it harder for people to vote, especially African Americans. In a Twitter video, he criticized the two high-profile Georgia companies for ties to China and tried to get a woke corporate hypocrites hashtag trending. The law recently approved by the Georgia Legislature is a Republican power grab in a state that voted blue in the presidential and Senate elections, the first such Democratic victories there in a generation.

Scott is reading  Do companies really want to sponsor the Genocide Olympics?111 via Fred Hiatt of The Washington Post  As Western businesses prepare to salute China at the Beijing Winter Olympics next February, the chairman of the China-Britain Business Council offered an all-purpose explanation of why its OK to do business with the Communists who are committing genocide 1,600 miles west of the ski slopes and skating rinks. If companies trade beyond Scandinavia and a few other countries, they will have to operate where human rights conditions are less than ideal. Lets not be naive, in other words.

Sponsors might find a few surprises in their anti-riot bill112 via Joe Henderson of Florida Politics  Florida Politics colleague Janelle Irwin is the host of a call-in show on WMNF radio in Tampa. Last Friday, she invited me to join her and one of our topics was the controversial anti-riot bill, HB 1. A caller from Sarasota identified herself as an escort at Planned Parenthood. She wondered if the anti-riot safety measures applied to her and the clinic. She told of routine harassment from protesters and verbal intimidation from anti-abortion activists. A provision under the mob intimidation heading seems to answer the callers question. Violation of this is a first-degree misdemeanor. Im going to take a wild guess here. Ill bet the bills sponsors didnt consider abortion clinics when they crafted this bill. Targeting transgender students hurts everyone113 via Heather Brinkworth for the South Florida Sun-Sentinel  A bill is currently being fast-tracked through the Florida Legislature that is, in my opinion, politicizing an issue that, for the last decade, has been a nonissue. As a former Broward County School Board member, I remember the arguments we heard against a policy allowing students to use the restroom that aligned with their sexual identity. Comments similar in nature, about all the horrible outcomes, were bandied about as reasons why we should not support LGBTQ students, comments that were not at all based in reality. James Baiardi Its time to finally fix staffing crisis in Floridas prison system114 via Florida Politics  The staffing crisis at the Florida Department of Corrections has created enormous challenges for every Correctional Officer providing care, custody, and control for individuals in our custody. To mitigate this crisis, the Senate and House are proposing prison consolidation plans. These plans call for the redeployment of officers from facilities in close proximity to each other by closing one prison and properly staffing the other. By shifting the staff, the plan provides optimal staffing levels and significantly improves both the quality of life for our officers and the safety and security of these facilities. Both plans redirect the savings from consolidating prisons and reinvests that money back into the prison system for salary and institutional improvements.

Princess Diana wanted to give her sons a normal upbringingPrincess Diana with her two sons Prince William and Prince Harry.  Tim Graham Photo Library via Getty Images It is no secret that Prince Williams mother, Princess Diana3, wanted her sons to have a normal life. She was adamant about teaching them things that other people do on a regular basis, such as doing volunteer work to help those who were less fortunate than they were. While most people assume that Prince William and Prince Harry had their every need tended to, this couldnt be further from the truth. According to some reports4, Princess Diana showed them the importance of everyday things, such as standing in line to buy a fast food meal and walking around theme parks like other kids their age. Princess Diana was constantly followed by photographers View this post on Instagram A statue of Diana, Princess of Wales will be erected in the grounds of Kensington Palace at the request of her sons, The Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry. The Princes have convened a committee to commission and privately raise funds for the creation of the statue. This committee will advise on the selection of the sculptor and will work with Historic Royal Palaces on the statues installation in the public gardens at Kensington Palace. The Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry said It has been twenty years since our mothers death and the time is right to recognise her positive impact in the UK and around the world with a permanent statue. Our mother touched so many lives. We hope the statue will help all those who visit Kensington Palace to reflect on her life and her legacy. While the sculpting of the statue will begin soon, it is not currently possible to advise when it will be unveiled. It is hoped that this will occur before the end of 2017. Further announcements on the statues sculptor and design will be made in due course.5 A post shared by Kensington Palace6 kensingtonroyal on Jan 28, 2017 at 108pm PST Although Prince William wanted to be a regular kid, this wasnt always an easy thing to do. As the son of Englands future king, and the future king himself, he has been in the public eye for his whole life. As we know, Princess Diana struggled with being followed by photographers, with The Baltimore Sun7 reporting that she was one of the most photographed women in the entire world. Not all of these photographs caught Princess Diana in her best moments, however. On more than one occasion, the late princess may have been photographed off-guard or in a private moment. Why was Prince William bullied at school? View this post on Instagram The Duke of Cambridge has today become Patron of homeless charity The Passage - here His Royal Highness is pictured with The Duke of Sussex and their mother Diana, Princess of Wales, in an early visit to passagecharity. Swipe to see a visitors book entry made by The Duke of Cambridge and Diana, Princess of Wales in 1993. The Duke has made additional visits to the charity at various points over the last 25 years.8 A post shared by Kensington Palace9 kensingtonroyal on Feb 13, 2019 at 627am PST When Prince William was only 14, he felt the effects of one of Princess Dianas photographs in a cruel and hurtful way. According to Us Weekly10, the young prince called his mother in tears, telling her that his classmates were teasing him after seeing topless photographs of Princess Diana that were taken while she was sunbathing in Spain. As if that werent horrible enough, Prince William was bullied even further, according to a Vogue Magazine publisher. His peers went on to say that Princess Dianas breasts were too small. The bullying was not an isolated incident As they say, history repeats itself, and this is exactly what happened. Many years later, E! News11 reports that the prince was once again angry when photographers were intrusive. They took pictures of his wife, Kate Middleton, sunbathing topless as Prince William rubbed sunscreen on her back. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were devastated at the violation of their privacy, and luckily, they took action and filed a lawsuit as a result of what they had experienced.The royals know that as a famous family who is in the spotlight most of the time, people take a great interest in everything that they do. However, the fact remains that they are entitled to their private time, and should not have to deal with bullying over any situation that they are in.

baltimore,Why Hedge Funds Shouldn't Own the News,2020-10-01T00:00:00Z,The American Prospect Blogs,The Baltimore Sun,"Since these two shadowy financial players increasingly converge, I will refer to all this as hedge fund activity.Dramatic changes in news ownership have been recent and swift. Today, hedge funds control one-third of U.S. newspapers2, and all four of the largest local newspaper chains are owned or managed by these poorly regulated financial institutions. Three-quarters of the top 200 newspapers by circulation are owned or controlled by hedge funds.The FBIs dire assessment spotlights the extreme lack of transparency already demonstrated by these companies, and in the context of local news, it has disastrous implications for democracy.The FBIs law enforcement sensitive bulletin on private equity was leaked and published online by a transparency group called Distributed Denial of Secrets3, after hackers broke into law enforcement records at a Texas web development company. The contents of the leak were verified4 by intelligence site Krebs on Security, and the story5 was reported by Reuters.Noting its assessment was made with high confidence, the FBIs report says that in the long term, criminally complicit investment fund managers likely will expand their money laundering operations as private placement opportunities increase, resulting in continued infiltration of the licit global financial system.The report continuesSpecifically, hedge funds and private equity firms receive funds from entities registered in nations that maintain laws conducive to masking underlying beneficial owners, thereby making it harder for US financial institutions and regulators to determine the source of funding. Additionally, hedge funds and private equity firms have been used to facilitate transactions in support of fraud, transnational organized crime, and sanctions evasion.The problem is that some of the basic safeguards used to detect money laundering just arent applied to private equity and hedge funds. Of the limited information available about hedge funds, most is general or not publicly reported, the report says, noting that the required annual Form PF, for example, is not public.Furthermore, since many hedge funds and private equity firms are unregistered entities, the SEC has limited oversight ability, making proactive identification of fraudulent hedge funds difficult, the assessment says. Common anti-money laundering measures that banks and traditional funds operate undersuch as know your customer due diligence programs or providing detailed trading data and company records to the SECdo not apply to private equity and hedge funds.

Today, the largest U.S. newspaper chainsTribune, McClatchy, Gannett, and MediaNews Group MNGare owned, controlled by, or indebted to hedge funds.Taken together, these chains are Americas primary source of local news. Under hedge fund stewardship, local newspapers are bleeding staff and resources, even shutting papers down. Much of this shrinkage has been intentionally accelerated by the hedge fund practice of cutting costs to the bone to maximize short-term returnsdemocracy be damned.Its true that newspapers have struggled for the past two decades to reinvent themselves in the face of readers turning to social media and online aggregators for information, and losing advertising revenue to the likes of Google. But were it not for hedge fund owners bleeding them dry, newspapers could be breaking even or turning modest profits.The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated their need to go digital, as print advertising income drops even more. In response to 2020s urgent demand for reliable, fact-checked information, many newspapers are looking to online subscriptions as a growing source of revenue.Most local news outlets are aggressively moving onto digital platforms. But hedge funds, with their emphasis on quick profits and extracting rather than investing cash, are now making that shift nearly impossible.Chains like Alden Global Capitals MNG simply arent investing to expand their online presence, because Alden has made clear it considers it a waste of money. When it unsuccessfully tried to buy Gannett, Alden was highly critical7 of the chains emphasis on digital, arguing the investment cut into shareholders returns.Today, hedge funds control one-third of U.S. newspapers, and all four of the largest local newspaper chains are owned or managed by these poorly regulated financial institutions. None of this is to suggest the hedge funds gobbling up troubled newspapers are also laundering cartel money.But their extreme lack of transparency and disinterest in sustainability should be concerning. And we dont know who invests in those particular funds registered in foreign tax havens.One of the things that private equity firms do is to try and hoover up as much money from overseas as possible through tax havens, through things like blocker corporations in the Cayman Islands, which are kind of conduits for money coming from other countries, said Nicholas Shaxson, author of Treasure Islands Uncovering the Damage of Offshore Banking and Tax Havens.What these blocker corporations do is strip out information, so any kind of financial information becomes secret, so you dont know who the co-investors are, who the people are delivering the other peoples money, Shaxson told me. Among the most secretive firms is the one I report on most, Alden Global Capital.Besides MNG, Alden owns a third of Tribune Publishing, publisher of the Chicago Tribune, New York Daily News, Hartford Courant, and Orlando Sentinel, among others, and has three seats on its board. MNG publishes hometown papers in San Jose, Denver, Orange County, Boston, St. Paul, Trenton, and scores of smaller communities around the country. Tribune publishes papers in Chicago, Baltimore, Hartford, and Orlando, among other locales. Alden also owns 7 percent of Lee Enterprisesthe countrys fifth-largest chainand 4 percent of Gannett, the largest chain. Your donation keeps this site free and open for all to read. Give what you can...SUPPORT THE PROSPECT8In March, Alden reported that nearly two-thirds 64 percent of its assets under management were beneficially owned by non-U.S. persons.So why does all this matter when it comes to local news? Secrecy We Americans dont like it when mysterious, unknown entities are in charge of a communitys primary source of information. Were used to knowing who owns the TV news network or newspaper in our townseven if only to complain about them. We want to know who they are, so we can judge whether their interests or biases align with our own.We certainly dont expect those owners to hide behind shell companies incorporated in tax-secrecy havens like the Cayman Islands. Want to speak your mind to one of the four Cayman Island funds Alden uses to control MNG? Good luck trying to identify their leadership, let alone their investors.Firms like the privately held Alden have long been highly secretive. As Shaxson told me, Alden is about the most opaque firm Ive ever seen.The New York-based company incorporates its funds in the Caymans and Delaware, locations well known as top corporate-secrecy havens. Alden acknowledgesin its Form ADV, the only publicly released annual report about its activities filed with the Securities and Exchange Commissionthat 64 percent of its assets are beneficially owned by non U.S. persons.But what does that mean? In the financial world, persons can refer to Aldens shell companies in the Caymans, as Aldens president Heath Freeman suggested9 when asked about it by Sens. Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth of Illinois. Or it can mean actual, flesh-and-blood people. We just dont know, because Freeman is not required to tell us, noting that Alden has customary contractual confidentiality arrangements with its investors limiting its ability to disclose their identities or background information.Chatham Asset Management, the hedge fund that put forth the winning bid to buy the McClatchy newspaper chain in a bankruptcy auction last month, also operates Cayman-based funds10. Of the three Chatham funds used to purchase McClatchy out of bankruptcy, one was based in the Cayman Islands. The guarantor of the transaction is based in the Cayman Islands.Apollo Global Management11 loaned the Gannett Company 1.8 billion to finance the Gannett-GateHouse merger in November 2019.

Coverage suffers As University of North Carolina researcher Penny Abernathy14 puts it, The loss of journalists always results in a loss of journalism, as editors have to make hard decisions about which stories to cover and which to ignore.When I first worked at the Alden-owned Monterey County Herald, we covered a geographically vast county. The paper has since dropped the word county from its masthead, because coverage of Salinas, the county seat, is now nearly nonexistent. So is in-depth coverage of most of the areas other cities, because the staff of four or five reporters cant physically be everywhere at once. Journalists also face a 2 p.m. deadline because the papers press was sold and the Herald is now printed a five-hour drive away.Elected officials know they can get away with more when reporters no longer cover their meetings. Research suggests that towns without newspapers pay higher rates for credit and bonds Following a newspaper closure, municipal borrowing costs increase by 5 to 11 basis points, costing the municipality an additional 650 thousand per issue, one report15 says, while other researchers found16 lower voter turnout in these communities. Private equity shows no interest in sustainability Private equity companies, as the FBI notes, frequently acquire a controlling interest of a financially distressed business with the prospect of returning it to profitability under new management or profiting from the sale of its underlying assets emphasis added.While Chatham purports to be interested in the first scenario, Alden is a case study in the latter. In its half-hearted bid to buy the McClatchy news chain at a bankruptcy auction last summer, Alden suggested it would lay off17 1,000 employees if it took over. In contrast, the winning bidder, Chatham, has vowed to keep all employees on staff18 and honor union contracts, although its record with a Canadian news chain tells a different story19 Chatham-controlled Postmedia has cut its work force, shuttered papers across Canada, reduced salaries and benefits, and centralized editorial operations in a way that has made parts of its 106 newspapers into clones of one another, according to The New York Times.Private equity firms and hedge funds like Alden drain news companies of any financial safety nets they once had, leaving them extra-vulnerable to crises like the current recession. These companies have baldly extracted papers cash reserves Alden admitted in court filings20 that it took hundreds of millions from its papers to invest in unrelated businesses that have since gone bankrupt. Theyve also stripped newspapers of their real estate, the collateral that businesses traditionally tap when they need loans to weather hard times.Instead of putting extra boots on the ground to cover the current crisis, MNG and Tribune immediately issued nationwide layoffs, furloughs, and buyouts as soon as the pandemic shutdown beganwithout pausing to first gauge its economic impact.The irony is that while papers print advertising has indeed tanked during the shutdown, their online news subscriptions have soared21, thanks to a public desperate for timely, trustworthy information.In the past, a crisis of any magnitudemuch less this life-changing moment in human historywould have meant all hands on deck, even if publishers had to dip into reserves or borrow against the companys assets. No more sports to cover? Fine, reassign the sports desk to report on the towns COVID-19 testing capacity or the countys latest shutdown order.But thats not what hedge funds do. Alden, in fact, furloughed many of its papers sports and other staff this spring. Hedge funds have shown, over and over, that they are ungrateful corporate citizens that want no investment in the social well-being of the communities these papers serve.The few reporters who remain in these skeleton news crews have proven that they are indeed essential workers. They bravely risk their lives as they report from hospitals, homeless shelters, and farm labor camps to tell fuller stories of the pandemics impact on all sectors of society.Yet other reporters, laid off or furloughed during this critical time, are posting on social media about their frustration at not being able to do their jobs.You might be looking for reports from the Tribune about this very serious flooding but the reporters who would have been working this evening are furloughed, tweeted22 Chicago Tribune reporter Madeline Buckley.Former Baltimore Sun reporter Alec MacGillis posted23 thisFurloughed wo pay this week at the Baltimore Sunhealth reporter mercohn24, in the midst of a pandemiccops reporter justin_fenton25, after a weekend of 8 murdersace political feature writer Tim_Prudente26, one week before huge mayoral election.Am I missing anyone, Tribune??There have been rumblings in Congress27 about making hedge funds and private equity more transparent, but to date theres been little headway. Now, before theres no one left to report on it, its time to ask whether private equity and hedge funds should be allowed in the news business at all.If hedge funds remain in the news business, they need to be fully transparent. Stakeholdersemployees, readers, and the general publicneed to know their investors, their managers, and their corporate governance. Likewise, if hedge funds remain in news, they need to be located in the United States. There is a good reason campaign finance laws prohibit donations from foreign nationals.

The CFD Office of Fire Investigation has determined the fire at Antioch Church to be accidental and caused by work being done on the building roof using a propane torch, the department said on Twitter. The multiple-alarm fire blaze at the Antioch Missionary Baptist Church began after 2 p.m. Friday, an hour after services ended, and wasnt brought under control for 90 minutes. Exactly three years prior, the famed Notre Dame cathedral in Paris was severely damaged after a fire broke out beneath its roof. This church is an anchor in this community, Antiochs pastor, the Rev. Gerald Dew, told reporters at the scene. If weve got to lose something, losing it on Good Friday is the best time to lose it because after Good Friday comes Resurrection Sunday. No one appeared to be inside at the time of the fire, Fire Department spokesman Larry Langford said. About 150 firefighters and 50 engines, trucks and ambulances went to the scene, he said. The only reported injury was a firefighter who slipped on the street, injured his ankle and was taken away in an ambulance, Langford said. The South Side church is well-known for its political clout and community involvement, investing in several housing projects starting in the 1960s.

baltimore,"60 years after Kennedy's assassination, many unknowns, contradictions and conspiracy theories remain",2023-11-22T00:00:00Z,CE Noticias Financieras English,The Baltimore Sun,"YOU MAY BE INTERESTED Trumps dire words raise new fears about his tendency toward authoritarianism.As the biography observedFew historical events have spawned hundreds, perhaps even thousands of conspiracy theories, like the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, in 1963. From an inside job to an unidentified umbrella man, aliens, multiple gunmen and a joint effort. Between the Cubans and the Soviets have been considered the perpetrators or directly involved in Kennedys disappearance.Sixty years have passed since that fateful day in downtown Dallas, when Lee Harvey Oswald, perched behind an upper floor window of the Texas School Book Depository building, allegedly fired at Kennedys Lincoln Continental convertible as the president rode through cheering crowds, striking him twice. Today, many are still searching for a satisfactory answer as to who really killed JFK, clinging to anything that looks leery in the hope that, if they try hard enough, the whole mystery will unravel.In Paramounts new documentary, JFK What the Doctors Saw, we are treated to a re-examination of the discrepancy between the conclusions drawn by the doctors who first saw President Kennedy at Parkland Hospital who believe the hole in Kennedys neck was an entry wound and the subsequent autopsy which claimed the neck hole was an exit wound, with accusations that undue influence was exerted on the latter medical team.Meanwhile, filmmaker Rob Reiner has launched a new iHeartPodcasts series with journalist Soledad OBrien, who claims to have groundbreaking new evidence about who killed JFK.In both cases, these programs primarily serve people for whom the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and the circumstances surrounding it, was not a redefinition of his presidency, but arguably its defining moment.Rumors of government conspiracies and mob-orchestrated hits have so pervaded popular culture particularly after the release of Oliver Stones 1991 blockbuster film, JFK, that it would not be unfair to suggest that most post-Baby Boomer Americans know a great deal about JFKs death. More than his life.Sixty-five percent of Americans have heard, and believe, that a conspiracy was behind the assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy on November 22, 1963. What would the polls have shown if Gallup had asked respondents if they had heard about other events in the life? Of the 35th president of the United States?Four U.S. presidents have been assassinated. But why is JFKs assassination the only one to generate thousands of conspiracy theories that challenge the official story?On April 14, 1865, the audience at Fords Theatre witnessed the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln by a shot to the back of the head, after which the assassin, John Wilkes Booth , jumped on stage and shouted Sic semper tyrannis! although the exact wording has been debated.On July 2, 1881, those gathered at the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad station, including Secretary of State James G. Blaine and Secretary of War Robert Todd Lincoln Abrahams eldest son, witnessed the assassination of President James A. Garfield, when The Aspiring Politician Charles Guiteau shot him from behind at point-blank range.On September 6, 1901, all the curious well-wishers gathered in the Temple of Music at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo witnessed the assassination of President William McKinley , when anarchist Leon Czolgosz shot him twice in the abdomen during a handshake, using an Ivor Johnson Revolver concealed in a handkerchief.Who was in charge of investigating the JFK assassination?The JFK assassination is also marred by ambiguity due to the amount of information that apparently slipped through the cracks of the first official investigation, often referred to as the Warren Commission. How could the United States of the 1960s be any less capable of gathering information about the death of a president than the United States of 1901?For that, lets consider how much American life had changed since 1901. It was only after President McKinleys death that year that the Secret Service, an organization initially created to combat counterfeit currency, was tasked with protecting the presidents life.McKinleys death also led President Theodore Roosevelt and Attorney General Charles Bonaparte to create the Office of Investigations, which when Kennedy took office would become known as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, under the controversial leadership of J. Edgar Hoover.And most significantly, the United States of 1901 was hardly on the global stage as it was after the first two world wars. Our vast entanglements in the world at large, as well as the Cold War brewing with the Soviet Union, would lead to the creation of the Central Intelligence Agency through the National Security Act of 1947.What happened on the day of JFKs assassination?It is impossible to summarize something as complex as the JFK assassination in less than the space of a book. In fact, Countdown to Dallas by Paul Brandus , published in 2023, estimates that approximately 40,000 books have been published about JFK and his untimely death.But these two paragraphs from John F. Kennedys full biography profile do the jobOn November 21, 1963, President Kennedy flew to Fort Worth, Texas, for a campaign appearance. The next day, November 22, Kennedy, along with his wife and Texas Governor John Connally, rode through cheering crowds in downtown Dallas in a Lincoln Continental. From an upstairs window of the Texas School Book Depository building, a 24-year-old warehouse worker named Lee Harvey Oswald, a former Marine with Soviet sympathies, fired at the car, hitting the president twice. Kennedy died at Parkland Memorial Hospital shortly thereafter, aged 46.A Dallas nightclub owner named Jack Ruby assassinated Oswald days later as he was being transferred between prisons. President Kennedys death was an unspeakable national tragedy and, to this day, many people recall with eerie vividness the exact moment they learned of his death. While conspiracy theories have circulated since Kennedys assassination, the official version of events remains the most plausible Oswald acted alone.Each conspiracy theory has been the subject of books, documentaries, feature films and too many exhaustive podcasts. No single article could possibly pick apart and debunk each theory. However, here is a cursory look at the most prominent conspiracy theories that have consumed the American public consciousness since the JFK assassination.JFK assassination conspiracy theory 1 The Mafia did it.The Mafia, particularly the Chicago Outfit, tends to be a factor in many conspiracy theories surrounding the JFK assassination, either as the sole culprit or as part of a larger conspiracy. Why would the Mafia have wanted to target John F. Kennedy? Perhaps they were distraught over the closing of their casinos in Cuba, or perhaps JFKs father, Joseph Kennedy , had mob connections because he made his fortune as a bootlegger.  He didnt .The most compelling argument for why the mob might want to kill a Kennedy is that then Attorney General and Johns brother Robert F. Kennedy had made it a priority to dismantle organized crime, even publicly challenging Teamsters leader Jimmy Hoffa for his ties to multiple mob figures. as organized crime had successfully infiltrated several syndicates at this time. Conspiracy theorists also emphasize that Jack Ruby, the man who shot Lee Harvey Oswald on November 24, 1963 while Oswald was in police custody, had some interactions with organized crime figures.But finding logic in killing JFK rather than Bobby who would be gunned down in 1968 by Sirhan Bishara Sirhan , in connection with the Middle East conflicts of the time may prove challenging for those who simply dont want it to be true. And as Biography notes , mob expert Ralph Salerno ...said he reviewed thousands of pages of electronic surveillance of organized crime leaders across the United States at the time the assassination occurred and heard nothing suspicious.JFK Assassination Conspiracy Theory 2 The Soviets did it.Yes, Lee Harvey Oswald lived in the USSR for a while. But the USSR did not have John F. Kennedy killed.This particular line of thinking has diminished considerably in recent decades. This is largely because, by now, if there were any evidence of Soviet involvement in the JFK assassination, we probably would have found it. The Soviet Union dissolved in 1991 the same year Oliver Stones JFK was released, and amid all that we learned from the KGB files that later emerged, from Khrushchevs biological weapons facility, Biopreparat, to the secret D-6 subway network beneath Moscow, there has not been even the slightest evidence to suggest that the USSR was behind the JFK assassination.In fact, Kennedy was actively working to find peace and understanding between the two superpowers. He corresponded with Premier Khrushchev much of which can be read on the State Department website, and even established a hotline with Moscow. The two leaders also seemed to like each other personally. Once, Khrushchev even gave the Kennedys a dog, which was appropriately named Pushinka.However, we now know that there was actually a Soviet plot related to the Kennedy assassination. And if youve ever shared a conspiracy theory for the JFK assassination, youre part of it.In 1992, a KGB archivist named Vasili Mitrokhin defected to the UK, bringing with him a trove of official documents he had absconded with over his 30-year career. These documents revealed that the KGB had actually worked to spread misinformation that the CIA was behind the JFK assassination, going so far as to forge a letter from Lee Harvey Oswald to CIA officer E. Howard Hunt best known today for his involvement in the Watergate case. theft to implicate him and the CIA in the assassination.JFK Assassination Conspiracy Theory 3 The Cubans Did ItOver the years, many people have postulated that the Cubans were behind the JFK assassination. The problem is that they cant seem to agree on who the Cubans are pro-Castro Cubans? anti-Castro Cubans?In terms of motive, both are there. For the anti-Castro Cubans, there was the issue of the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961 , a CIA-backed coup attempt that Kennedy had largely inherited from the Eisenhower administration and in which the U.S. reneged on its commitment to the very insurgents it had helped train afterwards. their covert activities became evident to the world. Moreover, recently discovered documents have shown that the Chicago Mafia was involved in the training of some of these Cuban exiles.Likewise, Fidel Castro would surely have had motive to want to kill the head of the U.S. government. Why? Because the U.S. government literally would not stop trying to kill him.The Church Committee , created in 1975 to investigate the activities of the CIA, FBI, NSA and IRS, found concrete evidence of at least eight plots involving the CIA to assassinate Fidel Castro between 1960 and 1965. In 2006, former Cuban intelligence chief Fabian Escalante claimed that over 40 years, Castro had dodged 638 assassination attempts, 42 of which occurred during the JFK administration.And, of course, Lee Harvey Oswald founded a chapter of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee in New Orleans, which put him on the FBIs radar.But beyond the potential motive, we have no evidence to suggest that anyone on either side of the Cuban conflict other than Castro-obsessed Oswald played any role in JFKs assassination. And, in fact, until his death, JFK was actively working to rebuild the U.S. relationship with Cuba that had been broken by the previous administration .JFK Assassination Conspiracy Theory 4 A secret society did it.Was Lee Harvey Oswald part of an Illuminati-style secret society that conspired to kill the president? The conspiracy theory is not as absurd as you think.In the late 1950s, two counterculture hipsters named Kerry Thornley and Greg Hill decided to create a satirical religion called Discordianism. And since every religion needs its central text, Thornley and Hill wrote the Principia Discordia and printed its first edition in 1963 on the copy machine of Jim Garrison, district attorney of Orleans Parish, Louisiana.In 1962, prior to writing the Principia Discordia, Thornley completed the manuscript of his novel The Idle Warriors , which was a comic, fictionalized account of his time in the Marine Corps. His main character, Johnny Shellburn, was based on a fellow Marine who swore he was a Communist and then defected to the Soviet Union - Lee Harvey Oswald.Usually, writing a funny novel about a former communist Navy connection, plus a faux religious text for a satirical cult, wont get you in trouble. But when that Communist Marine you once knew kills the president of the United States and you photocopy your cult manifesto on the machine belonging to the conspiracy-obsessed New Orleans district attorney desperate to implicate people in the assassination plot, thats a different story. . As Adam Gorightlys 2014 Caught in the Crossfire conveys , Thornley spent so much time being falsely accused of being part of the conspiracy to assassinate JFK that he began to believe he was actually an unwitting pawn in someone elses game.JFK Assassination Conspiracy Theory 5 The U.S. Government Did ItOver the past 60 years, virtually every facet of the U.S. government has been implicated in the JFK assassination through some book, blog or TV special.This is a particularly frightening accusation. The suggestion that a federal government, particularly one that so often touts freedom as its central ideal, would kill its own leader would have been considered largely out of place prior to the 1960s. And to be clear, there is not, nor has there ever been, any evidence that clearly links any part of the U.S. government to the specific act of JFKs assassination.To believe that the government was behind the JFK assassination is to rely on both the governments lack of total transparency during the investigation and the revelations of other illegal and unethical activities that came to light throughout the 1960s. These specific conspiracy theories act less as a solution to a murder and more as a portrait of the erosion of public trust that can occur in the absence of government accountability.Take, for example, the suggestion that the FBI was behind the Kennedy assassination. Proponents of this conspiracy theory point to tenuous connections such as the FBI being aware of Oswald and possibly harassing him according to Oswalds own accusations , as well as a memo from J. Edgar Hoover expressing the need to convince the public that Oswald is the real assassin.Later revelations about documented FBI activity in this period, such as the targeted harassment of Martin Luther King Jr , the covert and illegal activities of COINTELPRO, the provision of information leading to the assassination of Fred Hampton, and Hoovers personal involvement in the domestic surveillance of countless American citizens and the crafting of inaccurate posthumous narratives surrounding figures such as Viola Liuzzo damaged the Bureaus reputation in a way that took decades to shake.Some conspiracy theorists have suggested that Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson was behind the JFK assassination. This fringe theory was rooted in the idea that Johnson feared Kennedy would take him off the list in 1964, and that Kennedy intended to de-escalate a war in Vietnam as evidenced by NSAM 263 issued on October 11, 1963 from which Johnson was out to personally profit. Such a suggestion besmirches the memory and legacy of two presidents, Kennedy and Johnson on one occasion, the History Channel even had to publicly apologize for airing a television episode that exposed this particular conspiracy theory.In a 1968 book, Kennedys secretary, Evelyn Lincoln, suggested that the president had conveniently revealed to her privately , just three days before his death, that he intended to drop Johnson as his running mate in favor of Terry Sanford of North Carolina. But there is no public evidence to support this. In fact, on October 31, 1963 , Kennedy dispelled any rumors of a change of running mates. And considering that he was in Dallas on Nov. 22 as part of a larger tour of Texas to drum up support in the Lone Star state, that Kennedywon narrowly in 1960 because he had a Texas senator on his ticket, replacing him with a North Carolinian seems an odd calculation.Then there are the Pentagon Papers. The works of historians, pro-Johnson or not, largely agree that Lyndon B. Johnson shed his blood, sweat and tears to achieve not only the highest position of power in the land, but to push progressive policies while he was there, especially the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1968. However, reading the pages that Daniel Ellsberg leaked to the American public showed just how much other peoples blood Johnson was willing to shed.We now know, thanks to those leaked documents, that the U.S. withheld some of the truth about the Vietnam War from the American public. We know that the LBJ administration pushed through the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution under false pretenses,  authorizing President Johnson to take any action he believed necessary to retaliate and promote the maintenance of international peace and security in Southeast Asia .We know that during the Johnson administration, the Defense Department revised its rationale for prolonging combat in Vietnam to 70 percent to avoid a humiliating defeat of the United States. And we know that faced with Secretary of Defense Robert McNamaras suggestion in 1967 that the United States begin to withdraw from Vietnam, Johnson approved increasing the U.S. troop commitment to nearly 550,000.For the conspiracy-minded, it was easy to draw parallels between the controversial July 1937 funding approval, which then newly elected Congressman Lyndon B. Johnson pushed on behalf of the Brown amp Root firm, which had donated heavily to the Johnson campaign, and how in August 1965 the RMK-BRJ consortium was formed to build naval facilities in Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam.Prior to 1965, the consortium was simply RMK Raymond International, Inc. and Morrison-Knudsen International, Inc. The BR that was added under President Johnson to become RMK-BRJ? Brown and Root, Inc.Similar to how the Pentagon Papers added fuel to the LBJ did it fire, recent years have seen a resurgence of the fringe Secret Service accidentally shot Kennedy theory, first proposed by ballistics expert Howard Donahue in the pages of the Baltimore Sun in 1977, and had a wider audience in Bonar Menningers 1992 Deadly Mistake The Shot That Killed JFK .This theory proposes that while Lee Harvey Oswald fired two shots from the sixth floor of the Texas Book Depository, the third shot, the one that killed the president, was actually fired by a Secret Service agent armed with an AR-15 in the car behind the presidents limousine. According to the theory, the Secret Services interference in the investigations was designed to cover up its own mistake. Timely, this fringe theory is re-circulated whenever demonstrable Secret Service misconduct appears in the news, such as the 2012 Summit of the Americas VI affair , or the revelation of deleted texts in the midst of the January 6, 2021 hearings.And finally, there is the Central Intelligence Agency. Conspiracy theorists point to the fact that President Kennedy allegedly said he wanted to fragment the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds although that quote first surfaced from an anonymous source three years after his death . They mention that the CIA knew much more about Lee Harvey Oswald than they initially let on. And they remind us that Allen Dulles, CIA director until President Kennedy fired him after the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion, was later one of the seven men on the Warren Commission set up to investigate the assassination.But the most damning indictment against the CIA regarding the Kennedy assassination is not what we know it is what no one knew. No one knew what the CIA was really doing in the early 1960s. And that includes the White House.According to Philip Shenons 2013 A Cruel and Shocking Act The Secret History of the Kennedy Assassination, Bobby Kennedy directly asked then-CIA Director John McCone if the CIA had anything to do with the JFK assassination. I asked him in a way that he couldnt lie to me, Bobby recalled, ... and he said they hadnt.The CIA that the Kennedys inherited from the Eisenhower administration was one that Eisenhower himself could not or would not control. During Eisenhowers presidency, the CIA had already staged covert coups to overthrow the democratically elected leaders of Iran  Operation Ajax  and Guatemala  Operation PBSuccess , as well as having provided the encouragement, and sometimes even the weapons, that led to the death of the Prime Minister. Patrice Lumumba of the Democratic Republic of Congo and President Rafael Trujillo of the Dominican Republic.Bobby Kennedy knew firsthand what the CIA was capable of, having been directly involved in the assassination plots against Fidel Castro. When Bobby allegedly asked the CIA if they had killed his brother, the possibility that the agency had done so no substantial evidence suggests that this was true was not the scary part. Rather, the fact that the CIA had become unwieldy and irresponsible enough to even entertain the idea that it might have done it was more alarming.JFK assassination conspiracy theory 6 Oswald did it, all by himself.Of course, the likely reality is that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in killing JFK. And Oswald was not a patsy or a secret agent. He was simply a man who thought he was destined to matter and lashed out at anyone he felt was preventing him from achieving it. He clung to communism, to Cuba, to anything that made him feel a sense of purpose.And on November 22, 1963, Oswald decided that his purpose was to kill the president of the United States. Just as on April 10, 1963, Oswald decided his purpose was to kill conservative politician General Edwin Walker, although the bullet Oswald fired from the same Carcano rifle he would later use at the Book Depository narrowly missed its target. And just as another man searching for a sense of purpose, Jack Ruby, would take Oswalds life with the pull of a trigger on November 24, 1963.The decisions of two men gave rise to 60 years of conspiracy theories, often put forward by those who are convinced they can finally solve a mystery whose real solution simply cannot be accepted.For to accept that solution would mean accepting that no one, not even the President of the United States, is as safe as government systems promise us we are. It means accepting that a symbol of hope and a new frontier can be extinguished by one man with an army surplus rifle he bought for 20. And that his actions were not tied to any complex conspiracy. It was just a moment of chaos, where coincidences aligned to tear the country apart. A lot of people would rather believe in a conspiracy theory because, somehow, that makes them feel like they are in control. That there are rules to the game, that there is a system and that we can all be safe if we do what we are told.Why do we still believe in conspiracy theories about the JFK assassination?Conspiracy theorists continue to venture down the rabbit hole of the JFK assassination in hopes of finding something new. This mystery continues to haunt America 60 years later, and thats something we predicted would happen 60 years ago. Heres how Harrison E. Salisbury, deputy editor-in-chief of The New York Times, described the situation in his introduction to the 1964 publication of The Warren ReportThe legend of President Kennedys death began with the sniper rifle shot that took his life. It was born at about 1230 p.m. on November 22, 1963, when the lethal bullet screeched toward his body. It has grown steadily since then. moment.As a New York Times editor commented when he read the bulletin announcing the Presidents death at 135 p.m. that day In the year 2000 there will be men still arguing and writing about the Presidents death.Nothing that has happened since then seems to invalidate that assessment. Not even the Warren Commission can be expected to undermine the Kennedy legend. But this legend gives Lee Harvey Oswald the last word. And there are other far more deserving voices that need to be heard.While a host of films and podcasts seek to commemorate the 60th anniversary of JFKs assassination by solving the mystery, this years Down in Dallas Town From JFK to K2 chooses to focus on the people and place that were not simply transformed that day, but continue to transform afterward.The filmmakers talk with Mary Ann Moorman, in her first interview in 50 years, about how inadvertently taking photographs at the time of JFKs death impacted her profoundly. And the film examines how the local community that conspiracy theorists have preserved in metallic amber since November 22, 1963, has developed real, solvable problems, such as drug abuse and homelessness.If anyone should have had the last word on the Kennedy presidency, it was President Kennedy himself. But JFK is the only president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt who did not write a presidential memoir, and the first since McKinley whose legacy is defined not by his own pen, but by an assassins bullet.To address how the assassination has come to define, for many, the entirety of Kennedys legacy, we spoke with the director of the JFK Presidential Museum and Library, Alan Price. Do you find it frustrating that so many people obsess about JFKs assassination rather than his life?Its perhaps not surprising that such a tragic event, which brought down such an inspirational leader, is at the forefront of public curiosity, Price says. People find it difficult, intellectually and emotionally, to understand.",homelessness

Revoking Acostas press pass did not threaten the First Amendment rights of either CNN or Acosta. CNN is free to broadcast what it wants and report on anything it wants and Acosta is free to do the same. The funny thing about freedom of speech and freedom of the press is that while both freedoms are constitutionally guaranteed, the Constitution does not guarantee a right to a particular forum. There is no more right for Jim Acosta to have White House credentials than there is to have White House press conferences at all84 Brenda Snipes Resigns I Have Served the Purpose I Came Here for85 Brenda Snipes submitted her resignation as the elections supervisor of Broward County, Florida. Her decision came one day after Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum offered his second concession to Rep. Ron DeSantis R-FL in the Sunshine States gubernatorial election. I think I have served the purpose that I came here for, which was to provide a credible election product for our voters, said Snipes last week during a press conference. NBCs local affiliate in South Florida reported Brenda Snipess office illegally destroyed 6,000 ballots in 2016 after they were counted but a judge ordered them to be preserved.86 Cop Tasked With Helping Child Sex Crime Victims Arrested for Raping a Child Victim He Was Helping87 A disturbing case of police rape has surfaced out of the Los Angeles Sheriffs Department this week as a detective assigned to handle victims of child molestation cases was arrested for allegedly raping a 14-year-old girl. The girl was a victim in a case the officer was investigating and had already been raped by someone else. Detective Neil Kimball, 45, was assigned to the Special Victims Bureau, a unit tasked with investigation cases of sex crimes against children. Kimball was arrested on Friday on suspicion of rape by force and preventing or dissuading a witness or victim from testifying, said Nicole Nishida, spokeswoman for the departments Internal Criminal Investigations Bureau. Given the number of victims Kimball has had contact with in the past, this case has caused grave concern at the department. According to the LA Times, Kimball has investigated dozens of child molestation cases in the last 5 years as a member of the elite specialized unit.88 Federal Judge Finds Female Genital Mutilation Law Unconstitutional89 In a major blow to the government, a federal judge in Detroit has declared the nations female genital mutilation law unconstitutional, thereby dismissing nearly all of the charges against two Michigan doctors and seven others accused of subjecting at least nine minor girls to genital cutting in the nations first FGM case.

LOUIS COUNTY  A 53-year-old House Springs woman was shot and killed by a gunman at a Catholic Supply store in a strip mall on Manchester Road on Monday afternoon, police said. They identified her Tuesday morning as Jamie Schmidt, a customer at the store, where the gunman sexually assaulted at least one person before opening fire and then disappearing. Tuesday morning police released a detailed description of the attacker, saying he was a white man, about 40 to 50 years old, and 5 feet 7 inches to 5 feet 9 inches tall. He was wearing a black or gray paperboy-style cap, a navy blue Carhartt-style jacket, a red, white and black plaid shirt, glasses, a brown belt with a a red and blue square on the buckle. The shooting was reported to police at 319 p.m., and police shut down the shopping center and launched a manhunt that lasted into the night92 Hollywood Actors Threaten to Boycott Georgia After Democrats Loss93 Several Hollywood actors are calling for a boycott of Georgias film industry after Republican Brian Kemp officially won the states gubernatorial contest against Democrat Stacey Abrams.

While UC claims it doesnt have the specific data set requested by Richard Sander, the professor told The College Fix that the same kind of data was provided to us 10 years ago.96 Politicians and Police Set Tyrannys Perfect Example Gun Confiscation97 As a review of some of the current events that have been taking place in the U.S. recently, on 11518, Anne Arundel County Police in Maryland shot and killed a man as they attempted to exercise a red flag gun removal order. Those red flag orders went into effect on October 1 of this year. Lets take the definition of this new game directly from Wikipedia and examine it A red flag law is a gun violence protection law that permits police or family members to petition a state court to order the temporary removal of firearms from a person who may present a danger to others or themselves. A judge makes the determination to issue the order based on statements and actions made by the gun owner in question. After a set time, the guns are returned to the person from whom they were seized unless another court hearing extends the period of confiscation. Such orders are known as Extreme Risk Protection Orders ERPO in Oregon, Washington, Maryland, and Vermont, as Risk Protection Orders in Florida as Gun Violence Restraining Orders in California as risk warrants in Connecticut and as Proceedings for the Seizure and Retention of a Firearm in Indiana. Returning to the incident in Maryland, take a look at this excerpt from CBS News from 11618 Neither of the officers were injured. Their names werent released. It wasnt clear why the red flag order was issued. A spokeswoman for the Maryland Judiciary denied a request from the Baltimore Sun to release protection order requests associated with the home, citing the law which states the orders are confidential unless a court rules otherwise. Michele Willis, the mans niece, told the Baltimore Sun that one of her aunts requested the protective order against Willis, but she declined to say why. Marylands law, which went into effect Oct. 1, is more broad in that it allows certain health care providers to seek an order, in addition to family members and law enforcement. LOOK HOW THINGS WORK IN THE TOTALITARIAN HEIR TO THE SOVIET UNION THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS BECOME! Sounds as if its something right out of Solzhenitsyn, but here it is The names of the cops were not released. Secretive Policing The Baltimore Sun could not report on associated case actions. Muzzling of the Press Maryland Judiciary using a law to prevent the publics knowledge without court approval. Press ...blic Censorship An aunt reported himbut no reasons given by family or police. Finger-Pointing initiated Health Care reporters and family members can blow the whistle and enable these red flag orders to be set in motion. State Powers of Arrest and complete abrogation of rights under the Constitution of the United States with no recourse Thats it. Everyone with the 300 Spartans patch and the ???? ?a? or ???O? ???? written on their sleeves?  Translation Come and Take it!  Yes, they will. They are. For now, theyre attempting to do it without a fightpassing the legislation or circumventing it, rather and forcing the compliance of the citizenry. They are in the process of doing far more, and another episode really summarizes the key concept the Totalitarian mindset of elected officials. This piece is entitled, California Democrat threatens Nukes if Americans dont hand over their guns. This threat is not figurative it is literal. I strongly recommend reading the whole article. Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell D, CA is proposing that the government offer up to 1,000 for semi-automatic weapons, and a buy-back to place those firearms in the hands of the governmentfor an estimated cost of 15 billion This man should be removed from office immediately, no questions askedplaced upon administrative leave and then brought to bear for his statement. The mindset is the danger this is not the exception among politicians, but the norm. In these neo-feudal times, you the citizen are expected to wear your uniform, the tan called khakis erroneouslya fabric composition substituted for a color pants, and the red shirt of Target or the navy blue shirt of Wal-Mart. Wear them, and the little name tag, and give half of what you make to the governmentand allow them to craft your livesas you obey. Once again, the Benjamin Martin character in The Patriot portrayed by Mel Gibsonthat characters lines were correct An elected legislature can trample a mans rights as easily as a king. They are coming for the guns. They are marching forward with their legislation, to provide legitimacy for their actions under the color of law. Their doorkickers are ass-kickers, in good shape and sharp reflexes with good mental acumen. They are psychologically protected to allow them to act with full force without restraint protected with direct deposit of their check, protected with life insurance, and protected with healthcare for their familiesall of their basics taken care of, plus a badge theyre covered, when they come for the citizens. The last step for a full-blown tyranny before the actual collapse political, military, economic, or a combination thereof is evident in the tyrannical measures and inflictions they foster against their own populace.98 Report Elon Musk Weed Stuff Prompts NASA Probe of SpaceX Workplace Safety99 According to the Washington Post, NASA will launch an extensive safety review of SpaceX and Boeing, assessing the culture of the two private companies tapped to fly the agencys astronauts.

So the UN is now pushing for international law, criminalizing any country that disagrees with their open borders.106 Voters Electing Democrats Who Despise Them107 Kyrsten Sinema might not be able to stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue, shoot someone, and lose no support, but she could and did insult the very voters she was trying to woo and be the next duly-elected senator from the Copper State. The former Green Party gadfly and 9th Congressional District Representative has at last been declared the winner of Jeff Flakes departed Senate seat. Shes the first Arizona Democrat to win a Senate election in 30 years. Shes also the first high-profile politician that I know who spent decades mocking her own constituents as drug-addled nincompoops, only to, in the end, receive their backing. Sinemas record of contempt for her own people is nonpareil. The way she openly and endlessly complains about the loons in her state is akin to an elderly crank who never stops complaining about the one time the cable company once tried to upcharge him for Showtime. On multiple occasions, Sinema has referred to her home state as crazy, a meth lab for democracy, and an accursed place no good ever emerges from. Not once, it seems, did she ever stop to think how this obloquy reflects on her an Arizonan, after all. One is reminded of Flauberts classic quote By dint of railing at idiots, one runs the risk of becoming an idiot oneself. Despite her best attempts to shower voters with disdain, Sinema defeated her opponent, Martha McSally, a decorated war pilot with the distinction of being the first woman to ever fly a U.S. Air Force combat mission. Perhaps the self-loathing Arizonan was right this whole time Arizonans went with the pink-tutu accoutered Taliban sympathizer over a distinguished veteran. Quite a fine accomplishment for a state previously represented by the late John McCain. Comment Bottom line now the veneer has come off and Democrat ugliness is being revealed everywhere never, ever vote for a Democrat ie Communist.108 Watch Female Antifa Member Allegedly Spits on, Punches Conservative Activist109 Police arrested a 19-year-old Antifa protester Saturday for allegedly punching and spitting on conservative activists taking part in the HimToo rally in Portland, Oregon.

Late Monday, foreign and defence ministers from 25 countries agreed at the Council of the European Union on the 17 projects under the Permanent Structured Cooperation PESCO initiative, which was adopted by the bloc in December 2017.122 Corbyn Labour Will Stop Britain Fully Leaving European Union on WTO Brexit Terms123 British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn says his party will try to stop Britain leaving the European Union without an agreement if Prime Minister Theresa Mays divorce deal is rejected by Parliament. Corbyn, leader of the Labour Party, said in a speech to the Confederation of British Industry that neither the Cabinet nor Parliament would endorse such an extreme and frankly dangerous course. He said Labour will not countenance a no-deal Brexit, which could cause upheaval for businesses and people. But it is unclear what would happen if Parliament rejected the deal when it is put to a vote, likely next month. Corbyn said the proposed agreement is a botched, worst-of-all-worlds deal which is bad for Britain. Labour is calling for Britain to stay in a customs union with the EU and to have a strong relationship with the blocs single market. Critics say thats a vague and unachievable goal.124 De-Platforming UKIP Supporters Banned From PayPal125 Following on from Tommy Robinson being banned from Paypal, UKIP have issued a statement saying that the Party has received reports from its members and donors that they have been banned from Paypal for no good reason. Susan Smith said that she received an email from Paypal asking her if she held political office to which she replied that she does not. She was then asked for proof of address but given no clear instructions where to send this and then she received notification her account had been suspended. Other Party members told her they had the same experience. Gerard Batten MEP, UKIP Leader, slammed the nakedly political actions of Paypal. He pointed out that it was never those who support open borders or the politically correct establishment that have their accounts closed. Closing peoples accounts is simply wrong he insisted as many people use the service to pay their bills etc I will be writing tothe head of Paypal for an explanation of why these accountshave been shut down.126 Dog Accused of Racist Hate Crime In Bonkers Britain127 A dog has been accused of a racially aggravated hate crime after it fouled on the front of a property in the latest of bewildering incidents in Britain.

The funds were contributed via checks, bank transfers or electronic payments, the source said, confirming a report on Europe 1 radio. 138 Globalist Merkel Ally to UK Take Your Bad Brexit Deal or Leave it  Negotiations Are Over139 A senior German MP and longtime ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel has insisted there is no question that the bad Brexit deal offered by Brussels could be renegotiated. Chairman of the Bundestags foreign affairs committee, Norbert Röttgen, stated that the German government does not see any space for further negotiation or renegotiation regarding Prime Minister Theresa Mays super-soft Brexit agreement, which has been panned by Eurosceptics. We are convinced that the deal has now been struck. I personally consider this to be the best of all the bad deals one could negotiate. Now it is for both sides to decide whether to take it or leave it. The negotiations are over, The Times reported the Christian Democratic Union CDU figure saying.140 Hungarian Government Pressed for Answers About Gruevski141 Speaking at a press conference in Brussels, Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto reiterated that former Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski entered Hungary fully legally.

I stand with the incinerators, said the head of the big business group.

In 2010, a Saudi lawyer named Faisal Yamani wrote to the Danish newspapers that had published cartoons of Islams prophet, Mohammed. Claiming to act on behalf of 95,000 descendants of Mohammed, the Saudi lawyer said that the cartoons were defamatory and that legal proceedings would thereby begin. However, everything about the supposed legal claim reeked. How had Mr Yamani located all these descendants? How had he come up with exactly 95,000 of them? And how could you claim that a statement about somebody who died 1,400 years ago was defamatory? Legally, one cannot defame the dead.160 UK Were Seeing From the Government a Deliberate Decision Not to Deliver a Proper Brexit  Rees-Mogg161 The deal she always wanted  Theresa May.

Bahram, during the usual Monday press conference, revealed that there are some ambiguities about the implementation of the EU mechanism to protect trade with Iran from American sanctions. But we remain confident that Europeans can save the agreement .

The mechanism will not include the other signatories of the Iranian nuclear agreement, China and Russia, which will adopt their own payment mechanisms with Tehran. The United States, the 7 last August, started the first tranche of the sanctions imposed against Teheran, which concern companies that operate in the sectors of the commercialization of the dollar, gold, software for the management of industrial processes and various minerals. as graphite, raw metals and coal.

A Belgium-based defense contractor Luciad has sold the software to China, according to the South China Morning Post SCMP citing Chinese government sources. The software, which includes a Luciad Lightspeed application, is used to map the terrain and ensure situational awareness of military commanders. The software, which is in used by NATO and US militaries, visualizes changes in enemy positions and identifies targets in real time. Its 75 times faster than its closest competitor and is remarkably accurate. The same software is reportedly employed by US Special Operations Forces, whose raid on Osama bin Laden in Pakistan made headlines in 2011. Notably, a foreign company supplying software to the Chinese government must fully reveal its codes for a security check. But its unclear if Luciad complied with the requirement. Much to the concern of the US military, China has made an array of remarkable breakthroughs in military hi-tech over the past years. Beijing heavily invested in advanced military technologies, nearly outpacing the Americans.180 North Korea Demolished 10 Guard Posts With Explosives, Seoul Says181 Nov. 20 UPI  North Korea detonated 10 guard posts inside the demilitarized zone on Tuesday but left one guard post intact, as the two Koreas move forward to carry out agreements between Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in.182 Exclusive Theres No Such Thing as ISIS Father of Two Alleged Terrorists Accused of Plotting a Massacre Makes Bold Claim and Says Western Countries Are The Killers183 Samad and Ertuncs father Armagan Eriklioglu told Daily Mail Australia his son was not only not inspired by ISIS, but the terror organisation did not exist.184 Melbournes African Gang Crime Hot Spots Are Revealed  So is Your Suburb Safe?185 Melbournes western suburbs are particularly notorious for African gangs, with new figures showing a surge in the number of defendants born in Sudan.186 Three Charged Over Foiled Potentially Deadly Terror Attack in Australia187 Three would-be terrorists were arrested in Australia on Tuesday and face charges of planning a mass-casualty attack in Melbourne, the countrys second-largest city.

The ship is currently in Marseilles. The case regards the alleged dumping of dangerous and potentially infectious refuse, including medical materials, without the waste being separated, as if it were ordinary household waste. Prosecutors suspect that 24,000 kilos of waste was dumped in this way on 44 different occasions. The waste was alleged dumped in 11 ports  Trapani, Pozzallo, Augusta, Catania and Messina in Sicily Vibo Valentia, Reggio Calabria and Corigliano Calabro in Calabria Naples and Salerno in Campania and Brindisi in Puglia. In total, 24 people are under investigation in the probe conducted by State and finance police and coordinated by Catania prosecutors, sources said. The authorities also requested the seizure of 460,000 euros. I was right to stop the NGOs ships landing in Italian ports, Deputy Premier and Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said via Twitter. Not only did I stop the trafficking of migrants but, according to what has emerged, I stopped the trafficking of refuse too. portichiusi portsclosed. MSF said that the Italian judicial authorities request was a disproportionate and unfounded measure, purely aimed at criminalising lifesaving medical-humanitarian action at sea. After two years of defamatory and unfounded allegations of collusion with human traffickers, judicial investigations, and bureaucratic obstacles against our humanitarian work, we are now accused of organised crime aimed at illicit waste trafficking, said Karline Kleijer, MSFs head of emergencies.

In the commercial, Dion furtively enters a hospital maternity ward where she encounters a room full of children dressed according to their sex  blue for boys, pink for girls. After Dion blows a handful of black magic dust into the air, the babies outfits magically transform into black and white Celinununu apparel, and the boy and girl symbols on the wall are converted into white crosses, the brands logo.230 Hollywood Erases Hope231 On November 9, a film with star power titled Boy Erased debuted. Its a direct attack on the idea that young people or any with unwanted same-sex desires are entitled to professional counseling. The cast includes Nicole Kidman and Russell Crowe, who play Christian parents who coerce their 19-year-old son into what the film calls a gay conversion therapy program. Not surprisingly, the media are promoting the film. In a brief review, the Washington Post claimed that, by one estimate, nearly 700,000 Americans have been subjected to whats known as conversion therapy, a practice that attempts to change ones sexual orientation and  without evidence of efficacy  is still legal in 41 states. Think they have an agenda? Why not frame it In nine states, clients constitutional rights have been violated by state laws preventing them from getting the professional counseling they need to help them recover their natural sexuality. And In 14 states, parents are barred from securing licensed reparative therapy for their children. In his paper, Are Sexual Orientation Change Efforts SOCE Effective? Are They Harmful? What the Evidence Shows, Family Research Council Senior Fellow for Policy Peter Sprigg summarizes Critics of SOCE make two claims  that it is ineffective, and that it is harmful. Six studies or surveys from 2000 to 2018 are reviewed, all of which show that SOCE can be effective for some clients in bringing about significant change in some components of sexual orientation. Few harms were reported. Older reports, including 600 studies and five meta-analyses, showed the same. One widely-cited report on harms, with a sample selected for that purpose, offered almost entirely anecdotal rather than statistical evidence. These studies make clear that the evidence for the effectiveness of SOCE far outweighs the evidence of its harm.  Go Ahead, Representative Swalwell Make my Day Gun control advocates are tactically referring to this proposed effort as a buyback for the same reason restauranteurs call the Patagonian toothfish a Chilean sea bass on their menus. A government buyback of guns may sound much more palatable for the American public than a forcible government confiscation of firearms, but it doesnt change the nature of the thing. The actual choice for Americans, under Swalwells proposal, would be to sell their guns to the government, surrender them with no recompense, or have the government forcibly confiscate them, with offenders facing prosecution or violence at the hands of government agents. This is, of course, not a choice at all, but it presents the veneer of choice, meant to hide the constitutional rights that would be stolen from American citizens. But whats most amazing about all of this is the ease with which the confiscation of heretofore-legal firearms from millions of Americans is being proposed in open forums today. It is, after all, impossibly illogical to conclude that such an action by the federal government would not be in direct violation of the Second Amendment.232 Its Official  Gender is Abolished in Australia as State Votes to Make it Optional to Put a Babys Sex on the Birth Certificate  and Turncoat Liberal Speaker Made the Casting Vote233 Tasmania has passed landmark transgender rights laws through the lower house which include parents having to opt in to have a babys sex recorded on birth certificates.234 Mentally Retarded Children Being Sterilized Under Trans Agenda235 Watch the most censored and banned broadcast in the world and learn about the globalist plans for you and your family before its too late Alex Jones breaks down the globalists trans agenda, which is meant in part to sterilize mentally ill children with hormone treatments.236 Shock Video Kids Brainwashed to Hate White People237 Social justice indoctrination camp Children as young as 5 and 6 brainwashed to hate white people and identify as different genders.

The DC Council plans to vote on an emergency bill introduced by Councilmember Brianne Nadeau at the request of Mayor Muriel Bowser. The measure calls for the establishment of welcome and reception services and the provision of food, clothing, medical services, cash assistance and other necessities for migrants. But the proposal has some residents worried about unintended consequences. The Washington Legal Clinic for the Homeless called the legislation a poison apple Thursday. LegalAidDC tweeted Friday that the council should reject the bill in its current form, saying it will weaken basic protections that all unhoused individuals amp families deserve when they seek help in the District. The group also said in a statement that it is concerned about the unchecked powers it would give the mayor. The Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid Network has repeatedly taken issue with Bowsers claims that the overwhelming majority of migrants do not want to stay in D.C. once they arrive, saying that takes focus off the need to support those migrants who do want to stay in the capital. Local nonprofits say almost all the people arriving are asylum-seekers with pending immigration cases.","homeless, unhoused"

Fnality are comprised of a number of the worlds biggest banks including Barclays and UBS, all of whom are shareholders in the scheme. Their objective as stated on the companys website reads Fnality International has been founded to create a network of decentralised Financial Market Infrastructures dFMIs to deliver the means of payment-on-chain in tomorrows wholesale banking markets. In practice, what Fnality are seeking to deliver is the construction of a distributed ledger technology based global payment system, one that can facilitate tokenised, peer-to-peer markets. Before we look into this more, lets examine some of the key figureheads behind the project. First there is the CEO Rhomaios Ram, who for the best part of two decades worked for Deutsche Bank in roles that included European Head of Currencies ...mmodities and Head of Transaction Banking in the UK and Ireland. The Chairman of Fnality, Jim Turley, has also worked at Deutsche Bank in various different positions. Outside of commercial banking, Turley once served on the board of the New York Fed Foreign Exchange Committee. But perhaps the standout name on Fnalitys management team is Daniel Heller, the firms advisor on regulatory affairs. Described as an expert in financial sector regulation and financial stability, Heller has a track record of having served at both the Bank for International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund. At the BIS he was head of the Secretariat of the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems, whilst at the IMF he was the executive director for Switzerland, Poland, Serbia, Azerbaijan, and four Central Asian republics. According to the Peterson Institute, for which Heller is a visiting fellow, Hellers present research focuses on the impact of emerging digital technologies such as blockchain on the financial sector, financial stability, and central banking.50 MSNBC Hopes a Global Financial Crisis Will Help Democrats Win in 202051 Left desperate for Trump to lose even if it means ruining the lives of millions.52 Biden Online Russian Bots Tell People Biden is a Bad Guy53 Presidential candidate Joe Biden has made a claim that negative online comments telling people Biden is a bad guy are coming from Russian bots.

Im sure that they even have another insurance scheme in the works as we speak when this attempt to remove him because of mental instability fails. As I documented last week, mainstream media is helping with this cause by publishing articles that reference Trumps mental state. Though they are so far off base with their opinions they are attempting to show a pattern of instability so they have a reason to execute section 4 of the 25th Amendment President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. Thereupon Congress shall decide the issue, assembling within forty-eight hours for that purpose if not in session. If the Congress, within twenty-one days after receipt of the latter written declaration, or, if Congress is not in session, within twenty-one days after Congress is required to assemble, determines by two-thirds vote of both Houses that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall continue to discharge the same as Acting President. Pelosi continues to make comments that make its way into the print of the mainstream media that references Trumps so-called unstable mental condition. On May 23, 2019, she told a press conference Let me be very clear the presidents behavior, as far as his obstruction of justice, the things that he is doing, its in plain sight, it cannot be denied  ignoring subpoenas, obstruction of justice, Pelosi told reporters at her weekly press conference Thursday following the closed-door meeting.56 Democrats Continue to Hemorrhage Latino and Black Voters in Nevada Primary57 Communist Bernie Sanders won the Nevada Democrat party primary on Saturday.

That was when his troubles began prosecutors announced Wednesday that they want Hester to serve twenty years in prison and be under supervision for the rest of his life for plotted a jihad massacre in Kansas City. His case shows yet again how politically correct willful ignorance regarding the motivating ideology and magnitude of the jihad threat renders us all vulnerable. True to form, federal prosecutors are already busily ignoring the possibility that Hester was inspired to try to kill non-Muslims by Quranic exhortations such as kill them wherever you find them 2191, 489 cf. 95. According to the Columbia Tribune, they claim that mental health issues combined with a mockery of his race and intellect by fellow soldiers led him to extremists ideologies.

baltimore,Blood in Our Eyes,2019-08-08T00:00:00Z,Dissident Voice,The Baltimore Sun,"In the year following the shooting, Sturm Rugers profits increased 56 percent. Josh Harkinson, Mother Jones, June 2016 Researchers at the University of Leeds used two bodies of transcribed, informal conversations among members of the public, comprising five million words in the 1990s and 12 million words in the 2010s. In the earlier conversations, 100 per cent of references to a field concerned grass or farmland. That has fallen to 70 per cent, with modern conversation taking in the metaphorical fields of work, gravity or energy. Researchers also found that the following nature words have decreased in relative frequency among young people between the 1990s and 2010s lawn, twig, blackbird, picnic, fishing, paddle, sand, welly, desert, paw, snow, grass, jungle, sky, path, bridge, bush, land, hill, fish, pond, mountain, soil, branch, stick, park, ground, wheel, tree, stream, rock, bird, road, garden, shell. Anita Singh, The Telegraph, July 2019 Magnum Research Desert Eagle These large-caliber handguns, designed for hunting, have appeared in dozens of films, including RoboCop, The Matrix, Snatch, and Borat. Heres a gun that has very little practical usage, the owner of a prop company told the Baltimore Sun. The success of that particular weapon owes almost everything to the movies. Dave Gilson, Mother Jones, MayJune 2016 issue It is interesting that amid the fall out from the El Paso and Dayton shootings one hears very little about the gun industry. The Firearms Industry Trade Association writes Companies in the United States that manufacture, distribute, and sell firearms, ammunition, and hunting equipment employ as many as 49,146 people in the country and generate an additional 162,845 jobs in supplier and ancillary industries. These include jobs in supplying goods and services to manufacturers, distributors, and retailers, and those that depend on sales to workers in the firearms and ammunition industry. Ninety-one percent of guns manufactured in the U.S. are sold to citizens of the U.S. But this is nothing compared to the U.S. defense industry. Defense Newswrote Combined weapon sales from American companies for fiscal 2018 were up 13 percent over fiscal 2017 figures, netting American firms 192.3 billion, according to new numbers released Thursday by the State Department. The department previously announced that FY18 brought in 55.66 billion in foreign military sales, an uptick of 33 percent over FY fiscal year 17s 41.93 billion. Through the Foreign Military Sales process, the U.S. government serves as a go-between for foreign partners and American industry. What had not been released until now is the total direct commercial sales, the process through which foreign customers can directly buy systems from industry. Those figures topped 136.6 billion for FY18, a 6.6 percent increase from FY17s 128.1 billion. But this is hardly accurate given that two arms sales packages to Saudi Arabia equaled 287 BILLION all by themselves. It should be noted that the U.K. sold even more arms to Saudi Arabia. But I digress. Shimon Arad atWar on the Rocks writes The defense and aerospace industry is Americas second-largest gross exporter. The industry contributes approximately 1 trillion annually to the U.S. economy and employs around 2,500,000 people. On average, 30 percent of the industrys annual revenue is through arms exports So, its sorta all about how you count. The point is that the U.S. is a machine that makes and sells weapons. We are historys number one death merchant. Now, arms sales globally have increased over 40 since 2002 according the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Britain and France are among those showing the largest growth. The Saudi market includes 31 billion dollars just in armoured vehicle purchases. And its growing. Although because under Obama there were so many fighter jets sold to the Saudis and other gulf state monarchies that sales figures are likely to dip in the near future due to saturation. The government is essentially a branch of the death industry. Peter Castagno wrote just this year at Truthout After the resignation of Gen. James Mattis, Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan filled the post as interim head of the Defense Department. Before joining the Trump administration, Shanahan spent three decades working for Boeing  a blatant conflict of interest for the person responsible for overseeing federal contracts with private defense contractors. Col. Lawrence Wilkerson, Colin Powells former chief of staff, called Shanahan a living, breathing product of the military-industrial complex, and asserted that this revolving door keeps the national security elite very small, and very wealthy, and increasing its wealth as it goes up the chain. One egregious example of that revolving door is Heather Wilson, who has been secretary of the Air Force since 2017. In 2015, Lockheed Martin paid a 4.7 million settlement to the Department of Justice after the revelation it had used taxpayer funds to hire lobbyists for a 2.4 billion contract. One of the lobbyists was former New Mexico Representative Wilson, ranked as one of the most corrupt members of Congress by the nonprofit government watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Wilson was later confirmed as Air Force secretary in the Senate by a 76-22 vote. Mark T. Esper, the secretary of the Army, worked as vice president of government relations for Raytheon before joining the Trump administration in 2017. The Hill recognized Esper as one of Washingtons most powerful corporate lobbyists in 2015 and 2016, where he fought to influence acquisition policy and other areas of defense bills. Espers undersecretary, Ryan McCarthy, is a former Lockheed executive. So, back to El Paso and Dayton. First thing to note is that the narrative as always emphasizes the lone wolf gunmen idea, mentally unstable, a loner teased by classmates, bad haircut, etc. They might add he takes anti depressants and often, or hell, almost always, they do but rarely is the writing or the social connections and influences that shaped these young men investigated. In Norway, the Breivik story still tends to minimize the fascist connections that mass killer had throughout Europe. Whatever the truth of these shootings as in, some witnesses saw three men dressed in black, etc the one certainty is that the state will follow a clear story-line and hit home certain key points. The second thing that will happen for certain is more calls for gun control  you know, that three trillion dollar industry in death led by the United States. Remember here that some seventy thousand plus civilians have died in Yemen since the SaudiU.S. assault on that nearly defenseless nation. The poorest in the Arab world. Remember the millions upon millions who have been murdered across Africa in wars and conflicts often directly orchestrated by the U.S. And using American made weapons. US military aid to the rebels channeled unofficially through the illicit market, is routine and ongoing. In December 2015, a major US sponsored shipment of a staggering 995 tons of weapons was conducted in blatant violation of the ceasefire. According to Janes Defense Weekly, the U.S. is providing the weapons to Syrian rebel groups as part of a programme that continues despite the widely respected ceasefire in that country in December 2015. Michael Chossudovsky, Global Research, 2019 One of the secondary effects I suspect intentional of the government and law enforcement narrative on mass shooting incidents sic is one that emphasizes a need to control the mentally unstable a fluid definition that likely will include you and me at some point. Since the Philip K. Dickian idea of future crime1 is now relatively mainstream the focus on mass state quarantines of those who serve as potential threats is clearly implied in the master narratives on these shootings. The bourgeoisie respond to the death of white people and OK, a few hispanics, too with exaggerated horror. They do not show such horror at the atrocities in Yemen or Syria or Libya, committed by USNATO. But then the lone gunman story is containable and easily grasped by their truncated moral GPS. The white liberal does not scream gun control when cops execute another unarmed young black man or woman. Just as gun makers are ignored in the gun control logic, so are cops. The anti gun lobby seems okay with the idea that only steroid crazed racist policemen can carry guns. I have to tell you, Im not so OK with that. The familiarity of the rhetoric that surrounds these shootings has come to have a numbing effect. Still, it is important to note that as Adorno and Horkheimer observed that anti semitism grew in the U.S. after the defeat of the Nazis. So the love of guns and death seems to grow after each of these mass shootings. But the rise in gun related deaths contains another less advertised fact While much of the public attention is on the intense tragedies of gun massacres in the US - 2017 saw the deadliest mass shooting by an individual to take place in the country in modern history, when 58 people died in the 1 October rampage on the Las Vegas Strip - in fact most suffering takes place in isolated and lonely incidents that receive scant media coverage. Of those, suicide is by far the greatest killer, accounting for about 60 of all gun deaths. Ed Pilkington, The Guardian, 2018 Gabor Mate, after the attack at the synagogue in Pittsburgh, wrote that the shootersanger that has got nothing to do with what they think they are angry about. They are just angry because of what life has done to them as children and then they find external targets. And this is what Fascism does too, of course. It provides an explanation, and a direction for the inarticulate rage. The U.S. is a stunningly sick society. I have grown weary of writing this fact because one finds oneself repeatedly in situations where this obvious truth must be stated..again. That sixty percent of gun deaths are suicide is a stunning statistic. The irrational hatred of the other is always equally a self hatred. And you have to see these narrative themes cropping up again and again in only indirectly related issues. Ive noted the racist eugenics backdrop to the overpopulation fear, a backdrop that finds partial expression in the work of the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation in Africa  where the theme is sterilization. The west then, regards Africa, arms conflicts they  the U.S.  start, and at the same time work to stop reproduction on the continent. Eradication of the dark-skinned other is a theme that cuts across all these white psycho shooters and it cuts across the story of western capital. Jews, blacks, Arabs, Hispanics  this is the legacy of colonialism and Manifest Destiny and European whiteness. American exceptionalism. The very good Belen Fernandez Al Jazeera, 2019 wrote The American Civil Liberties Union ACLU conducted a test of Rekognition, Amazons facial recognition software, which compared images of all the members of the US Congress with a database of mugshots. The results, according to Rekognition 28 US Congresspeople were identified as criminals. And what do you know the false matches pertained disproportionately to people of colour. Now imagine the complications that might arise when you have such technology in the hands of US law enforcement officials who have already proven themselves predisposed to shooting black people for no reason. In addition to marketing its product to officials from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE and other notoriously abusive entities, Amazon has also pushed for Rekognitions use in police body cameras - which would presumably only increase the chances of pre-emptive misidentification by trigger-happy forces of law and order. The arms industry comes to mind, which has helped to eradicate countless lives from Iraq to Yemen and beyond. And as Raja stresses, it is important to remember in the US context that what happens abroad matters and vice-versa. Case in point Technology is often tested on the bodies of Black and Brown people, perfected and then applied locally. As it turns out, the US is also one of a group of countries opposing a UN-proposed ban on the development of so-called killer robots lethal autonomous weapons systems that use artificial intelligence - think facial recognition-equipped swarms of drones. The reality is that the violence of Dylann Roof or Jared Lee Loughner or James Holmes is one with the violence of Fallujah or Afghanistan. The US occupies several countries as I write this, and has military bases spread across the world. Surrounding each base one will find spikes in public intoxication, fights, domestic abuse, rape and drug abuse. Nobody in those places want the U.S. military there. For the military is not only the expression of historical American violence and racism, but it also horribly pollutes the areas in which it is located. For this is only another aspect of the violence. A psychic pollution, an emotional toxicity that is embedded in the uniform and the various repressions that entails. The military is the violence of the ruling elite made operative. I am reminded of two quotes of George Jacksons Im convinced that it is the psychopathic personality that searches out a uniform. Theres little doubt of whats going on in that mans head who will voluntarily don any uniform. Soledad The Prison Letters of George Jackson, October 1, 1970 and Intellectuals still argue whether Amerika is a fascist country. This concern is typical of the Amerikan lefts flight from reality. This is actually a manifestation of the authoritarian process seeping into its own psyche. Blood in My Eye, Black Classic Press, 1971 Suggesting mental illness as the cause of these shooters violence is to distract from the institutional and class violence that exists all around them. In which each grew up. To focus disproportionately on their isolation or loneliness is almost ironic given they live in a society of acute crippling loneliness and in which suicide is rampant. A society in which isolation is manufactured by the state as only another strategy of control. Collectively breeds radicalization. If people start to talk to each other, they might start to dissent from these master narratives. Best to stop all institutions of the collective. Best to deride any political form of collectivitylike, oh, communism. Best to refer to socialism as something practiced by war monger Bernie Sanders or pseudo progressive Alexandria Ocasio Cortez that way the real socialism of a, say, Antonio Gramsci or Rosa Luxemburg will not be investigated. Best to encourage stories of individualism and triumph over social adversity. Not stories of tearing down systems of oppression. Why is history being re-written? Vietnam, Korea, World War 2. Ask yourselves that rather simple question. Or the history of the Soviet Union, or Cuba, or Mao or Ho Chi Minh? Treat global pollution and climate change as if it were a Hollywood disaster movie. Stigmatize asking questions, ridicule dissenting voices, shame those who will not submit to the official narrative. And the question here in the shadow of El Paso is not the truth or falsity of the narrative but the insistence on a submission to it. This is the same logic you would find at Jonestown if you went back in time. The very same. Or Synanon, or Heavens Gate. People are actually volunteering to stop having children. To stop flying. Voluntarily. Here is a clue, the U.S. military hasnt stopped flying. And whenever the ruling class is talking to you  you should distrust what they say. Full stop. And to underscore the racism2 so incrusted in American society and the climate discourse. The populace today is encouraged to trust in consensus. Trust in popularity. If a movie is popular, well, it must be good. If everyone says something is true, well, it must be. As Norman Mailer said years ago, Americans are incapableof confronting a book unless it is successful.Lonely mentally ill young white men who shoot up public spaces do so because they can buy guns. And are mentally ill. In a society in which the economy is built upon mass violence and the manufacturing of guns, weapons, and ammunition. In which most new technology comes out of Pentagon research projects. Are the police who beat or abuse or kill blacks and hispanics and native Americansare they lonely and mentally ill? I mean, Id say yeah, but thats not the official narrative. And how many of those murderous policemen were veterans of the American military? The U.S. teaches violence. It glorifies it and romanticizes it and sexualizes it. Of course, people are going to shoot each other. As daily life becomes more unreal, and more intolerable, the suffering will find an outlet. And the one that is met with least resistance is the buying of guns. Young men are trained to think in martial terms. And this is where Trump can be seen as the perfect foil for the ruling class and why he will be re-elected. When Trump starts to tweet his concerns about public safety he will I predict also begin a normalizing of martial law and internment camps. I mean, camps are already mostly in use, albeit in small ways still. But martial law has been tested already with the Boston marathon shooting and subsequent hunt for the bombers. An entire city was shut down with almost unanimous public approval. Barry Grey, World Socialist Web Site WSWS on April 2013, wrote The events in Boston have laid bare the modus operandi for the establishment of dictatorial forms of rule in the US. One or another violent act carried out by disoriented or disaffected individuals, perhaps with the help of elements within the state, is declared a terrorist event. A state of siege is imposed suspending democratic rights and establishing military-police control. And it occurred after Hurricane Katrina when the governor declared an state of emergency  evacuations were ordered and people were forced out of their homes and many businesses were closed. People were, in fact, removed to FEMA camps. Trump would meet with only symbolic objections by the Democratic Party. Some hand wringing and measured words of concern from Pelosi or Shurmer or Bidenand no doubt support from ex cop Harris and crypto-fascist Warren. Its for your own good, after all. In fact, its for the good of those put in these camps. This is a nation, remember, where the government already flies surveillance drones to spy on its own citizens, and helicopters patrol areas targeted as potentially high crime black and poor mostly and SWAT teams increasingly are called out for routine offences  and where even small towns and some Universities have military surplus armoured fighting vehicles at their disposal. On September 29, 2006, President Bush signed the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act NDAA. The law expanded Presidential authority to declare Martial Law under revisions to the Insurrection Act. The law was rolled back slightly in 2008 but Obama then signed a new version of NDAA that would allow the arrest and detention of U.S. citizens without due process. Obama also oversaw a federal policing report in 2012 that suggested use of the military to supplement domestic police departments in times of social unrest. The creation of NORTHCOM Northern Command was really to draw up plans for civil unrest throughout north America. As Patrick Martin wrote in World Socialist Web Site WSWS back in 2005 While Northcom was established only in October 2002, its headquarters staff of 640 is already larger than that of the Southern Command, which overseas US military operations throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. The reality is that the military brass is intensely interested in monitoring political dissent because its domestic operations will be directed not against a relative handful of Islamic fundamentalist terroristswho have not carried out a single operation inside the United States since September 11, 2001but against the democratic rights of the American people. The lone wolf shooter is now a domestic terrorist. Liberals are way out front on this designation, too. The terrorist tag opens the way to the further removal of all due process. So both a mentally ill misfit AND a domestic terrorist. Much as Osama bin Laden was an evil mastermind AND a cave dwelling primitive. If martial law comes, it wont be called martial law. It will be called Emergency Protective Sanctuary or some other Madison Avenue opaque and Orwellian term. Israel has rather perfected this stuff, though they seem today to barely care about global opinion. The climate crises plays into this, too, of course. It is useful to take the time to find the source of whatever dire warnings you are being told. Much of it has direct connections to the U.S. military in all its branches. Mike Pompeo even said3 the melting arctic presents a great business opportunity. Trump is not an aberration or anomaly. He is the logical outcome of three hundred years of white supremacist values, arrogance, and class oppression. One need look back no further than Ronald Reagan to see the origins of much of what Trump is about. The Democrats are to the right of Trump on most of his foreign policy, and they will increasingly attack him from the right throughout this coming electoral season. Meanwhile the last shreds of civil liberties and due process are being removed. Fear is a great distraction. Its the governments three card monte game  and liberals and democrats are completely behind anything that is labeled green or about safety. Well, the safety of white people, mostly. And that doesnt mean the homeless, of course. They are, in fact, another health and hygiene threat that needs to be dealt with. For their own good, naturally.  1 646daaa564a1  2  3",homeless

baltimore,"MOTION TO DISCHARGE--S.J RES. 77; Congressional Record Vol. 166, No. 208 (Senate - December 09, 2020)",2020-12-10T00:00:00Z,Impact News Service,The Baltimore Sun,"Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act of 1976, I move to discharge the Foreign Relations Committee from further consideration of S.J Res. 77, a joint resolution providing for congressional disapproval of the proposed foreign military sale to the United Arab Emirates of certain defense articles and services. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is pending. Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, today I am asking our colleagues to stand up for two very important principles. One is the congressional oversight over arms sales abroad and, secondly, to ensure that these sales, in fact, promote and protect the long-term national security of the United States. Colleagues, I wish we didnt find ourselves in the position of having to discuss our concerns with this sale in this kind of forum. The United Arab Emirates has, indeed, been an important partner in the fight against terrorism and across the region and, I believe, will continue to do so. However, a sale of this magnitude requires the appropriate due diligence. For the past few decades, the executive branch has respected the congressional oversight of the arms sales process, a critical piece of which is an informal review period during which we get answers to pressing questions. We have an opportunity to review sensitive information so that, when sales come up for the formal notification, which is what we have before us now, we have a clearer path forward. Unfortunately, in this case, the Trump administration decided to simply ignore congressional rights here and the review process, formally notifying the sales of these complex weapons systems, along with other weaponry, totaling 23 billion. Beyond obliterating the congressional review process, the administration also seems to have rushed through the interagency review of a sale of this magnitude. Whereas, a sale of this scope would normally merit months and months of detailed deliberations between the Departments of Defense and State, this sale was announced with more missing than a few dotted is and crossed ts. I will go into more detail later before we vote, but the bottom line is that there are many outstanding issues that are critical to U.S national security that have not been addressed, including, by way of example, the United Arab Emirates present and future military relationships with Russia and China. My understanding is that there are negotiations to have with China regarding an airstrip for the Chinese military off of the UAE. Is that in the national interest and security of the United States? Should we not have a definitive commitment from the UAE that it will not move forward if these arms sales move forward, including with the most sophisticated stealth jet fighter that we have? How do we work to safeguard U.S technology? the guarantees we will have in place about how U.S -origin weapons will be used given the Emirates history of transferring weapons to a terrorist organization and violating the U.N arms embargo in Libya? the longer term implications of an arms race in the region? and then, yes, the impact that it could have on both our and Israels qualitative military edge? If we arent going to be willing to ask these questions, then we have to think about the magnitude of the sale without caring about the consequences. I have heard a number of my colleagues advocate in support of these sales because they believe it will help our like-minded partners better posture against Iran. Now, no one is more clear-eyed in this Chamber or has pursued Iran and its threat of nuclear weapons more than I, and we are clear-eyed about the threat Iran continues to pose to national security interests, but we have yet to understand exactly what military threat the F-35s or armed drones will be addressing vis-a-vis Iran. Furthermore, according to the Trump administration, as recently as last year, the UAE continued to host a number of companies that facilitated Iranian financial transactions in violation of various U.S sanctions. So Iran is a threat, but you are helping it facilitate U.S financial transactions. It is not that I have said so but that the Trump administration has said so. Meanwhile, over the past year, Iran has ramped up its nuclear capabilities amidst American diplomatic fallout. So, if we really want to talk about countering Iran, we need a comprehensive, diplomatic strategy. Arming partners with complex weapons systems that could take years to come online is not a serious strategy with which to confront the very real and timely threats from Iran. I have also heard some of our colleagues argue that, if we do not sell these weapons, the UAE will turn to China and Russia. Well, lets be clear They already do. They already do. Our own Department of Defenses inspector general recently reported that the UAE may be funding the Russian mercenary Wagner Group in Libya. U.N reporting implicates the UAEs use of Chinese-manufactured drones, in violation of the U.N arms embargo, also in Libya. So, while I absolutely agree that we have to counter Chinese and Russian influence in the region, again, this requires a real strategy, not simply more arms. Isnt this a conversation and a commitment that we should get in writing from the UAE as part of such an arms sale? We dont have that. Furthermore, if we go forward with these sales, yet deny similar requests to countries like Qatar or Saudi Arabia, where will they go for their advanced weaponry to keep pace, and what reaction will Iran have to them? Do we really think we can sell this just to the UAE and not have those other countries come knocking on our door, starting a very sophisticated arms race in a tinder box of the world? Finally, let me be very clear I applaud the Abraham accords as a historical turning point for Israel and the Arab world. These new, formal relationships have the possibility of transforming the region much more broadly and bringing peace, stability, and prosperity to people who desperately want Page S7297 and deserve it. Yet, as the administration and the Emirates have continued to stress, these sales are neither a reward nor are they part of these accords. So why cant we take a little more time to really assess the best way forward? We are in the midst of promoting a sale--this is the administration--that has some of the most significant transfers of advanced U.S technology without clarity of a number of key details regarding the sale or sufficient answers to critical national security questions. This is far more than about congressional prerogative, although I would argue that it is a critical element of our policies on arms sales this is about national security concerns to which we should have an answer before those arms sales move forward. Again, colleagues, the bottom line is this There are far too many outstanding questions and very serious questions about long-term U.S national security interests. Perhaps, after considerable engagement with the executive, we would assess that all of these sales do, in fact, advance our national security. Given the length of time it will take for the delivery of these systems, it would seem quite reasonable to expect to have 40 days to evaluate these questions. So I urge my colleagues to stand up for Congresss role in the process of determining arms sales as well as for having clear answers to the critical questions that are posed to long-term U.S national security interests. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr. Yount. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I am on the floor today to speak to resolutions upon which we will begin voting today regarding arms sales proposed by the administration to the United Arab Emirates. I am on the floor today to ask my colleagues to support these resolutions of disapproval upon two grounds one, the protection of congressional prerogative and, two, a question of U.S national security. First, let me cover the question of congressional prerogative. We have traditionally debated arms sales here on occasion, and the reason why we dont have constant debates in this body on arms sales, the reason why we dont have resolutions on every sale that is noticed by the administration, is because we have built into our practice an ability for the Senate to consult with the administration beforehand on a bipartisan basis. Over the years, since the passage of the law allowing for Congress to have a role in the sale of arms to foreign nations, administration after administration, Republican and Democrat, has observed a period of consultation with Congress in which the administration comes to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, comes to the House Foreign Relations Committee, presents the reasons for the sale, and then addresses concerns raised, often in a bipartisan manner, by Republicans and Democrats. Again, this has happened in both Democratic and Republican administrations, with Democratic and Republican Congresses, and often that consultative process results in issues that Congress has being resolved so that you never have to have a vote on the Senate floor. Something different happened with this sale. The administration was so desperate to rush through the sale before the end of their administration that they blew through the consultation process. It just didnt happen. There was no ability for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to weigh in on this particular sale. It was rushed to notice, and our only option was to bring it before the full Senate. Now, under any circumstances, I would argue that the Senate should stand up for our right to have a role. The reason that we built in this consultative process was because the Senate was actually unhappy with the amount of input it had decades ago and was threatening to dramatically expand its oversight role on arms sales. Instead, a deal was worked out in which the administration said they would come for this consultation. Now it appears that those consultations are no longer the practice. That reduces our role as a foreign-policy-making body. And remember, we have abdicated all sorts of responsibilities over the years when it comes to what should be a coequal responsibility to set the broad direction of U.S foreign policy with the executive branch. This would be yet another chip away at Congresss participation in the setting of U.S national security policy. I am not sure we will ever get it back. But on this sale, in particular, the consultative process was really important because this sale is as big and as hairy and as complicated as you get. We are, for the first time, selling F-35s and MQ-9 Reaper drones into the heart of the Middle East. We have never done it before. There are only 14 countries that currently operate the F-35, and almost all of them are NATO allies. Turkey was on the list for a period of time, but because they ended up making a choice to go with the Russian missile defense system, they were taken out of the program. So the partners that remain are the ones that you would suspect--Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Australia, Denmark, Canada. There are even fewer countries that we have sold Reaper drones to-- Australia, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, UK, and India. This is the first time that we would sell these incredibly lethal, incredibly complicated technologies into the heart of the Middle East-- a region that, arguably, is not in need of more weapons. What we risk doing here is fueling an arms race. Today we may be selling the F-35s and the MQ-9s to the UAE, but the Saudis are going to want it, the Qataris have already requested it, and it just fuels Irans interest in continuing to build up its own military program. But, more specifically to this sale, we have to ask ourselves whether the UAE is ready for this technology or whether their behavior over the past several years makes them an unworthy partner for this set of highly complicated U.S defense technology. I will stipulate, as I think every Member of this body will, that the UAE is often a very important ally of the United States. There is an important cooperative relationship that exists between the United States and the UAE. We share counterterrorism information together. We were both involved in the fight against ISIS. We work together to counter Iranian influence in the region. And, of course, the UAEs recognition of Israel is good for the United States as well. But for as many places as we cooperate with UAE, there are many points of division, and those points of division often involve the use of U.S military technology against the interests of the United States. The UAE has been, for years, involved in a civil war in Yemen that is terrible for U.S national security interests. They may not be as involved as they were a couple of years ago, but they are still a barrier to peace. They still refuse to make humanitarian contributions to help the situation on the ground. So far in 2020, there are zero dollars from the UAE put into the U.N appeal to try to fight off starvation and cholera inside Yemen. At one point, they took U.S equipment and they handed it to extremist militias inside Yemen. That is open-source reporting. The UAE copped to it when the reporters asked them whether they had done it. They gave our equipment to Salafist militias inside a theater of war. There are other reports that they were dropping American-made TOW missiles out of the sky into areas of that country that were controlled by al-Qaida-aligned elements. And they are, right now, as we speak, in violation of the Libya arms embargo. The U.N Panel of Experts came to the conclusion that the majority of arms transfers into Libya to the Haftar armed forces were either from Jordan or the United Arab Emirates. The panel found that the UAE was in repeated noncompliance with the arms embargo. And guess what is on the list of the weapons that the UAE was transferring into Libya in violation of a U.S -supported arms embargo-- armed drones. Page S7298 We are talking about selling the UAE the most lethal, most advanced armed drone technology in the world today, and as we speak, the UAE is in violation of the arms embargo to Libya, fueling that civil war, specifically sending drones into that theater. So I am not here to say that we shouldnt be in the security business with the UAE. There are a lot of important common projects. But the question is, with a country that is part of the problem more often than part of the solution in Yemen, a country that is in existing violation of an arms embargo in Libya, a country that has just within the last several years transferred our weapons to al-Qaida-aligned militias, without resolving those issues, is this the moment to be selling, for the first time ever, F-35s, armed drones into the heart of the Middle East? One last caution. The countries that I mentioned on this list are by and large in business with the United States and not with China and Russia. The UAE has pretty deep and complicated defense relationships with China, Russia, and Chinese and Russian companies. Query whether we can be absolutely certain that the technology on board those fighter jets, those drones, is going to stay in the right hands. There arguably is no other country on the list for the F-35s that does as much business with China and Russia as the UAE does. In fact, as I mentioned, we pulled the F-35 program from Turkey because they are involved with Russia on a very complicated and important ground defense system, and we are just learning about the nature of the partnerships that the UAE has with the Chinese and the Russians. It stands to reason that this would be one of the issues that a consultative process with Congress would resolve. It also stands to reason that we could probably come to a conclusion during that consultative process. If the UAE really wants those weapons, wants to be the first country in the heart of the Middle East to get the F-35 or the Reaper drones, then I assume they would want to be able to assure Congress and the administration that there is no chance of technology transfer into the wrong hands. That is what the congressional consultative process would have gotten us, but it didnt happen in this case, and so we are stuck with this vote--a means for Congress to stand up for its right to participate in this question of arms sales. Believe me, my Republican colleagues are going to want that right when a Democratic administration comes into office. You are not going to want to send a signal today to the Biden administration that they dont have to consult with you as the majority party, potentially, in 2021. But if you vote against these resolutions, then you are essentially saying the Biden administration doesnt need to consult with Congress on it. They probably will because they want to do the right thing, but anybody who votes against these resolutions is essentially endorsing an end-around of Congress by any administration, Republican or Democratic. It is also important to say that on policy grounds, it is not time to do these sales. There are too many outstanding questions about who the UAE transfers weapons to, what they are doing in Libya, why they havent been part of the solution in Yemen, and what their relationship is with some of our most important adversaries around the globe. Until we satisfy the answers to those questions, we should not move forward with this sale. Finally, there is no threat to the accords between UAE and Israel unwinding if we simply press pause on this sale until those questions are answered. I do want to be in business with the UAE. I think they are an important defense partner. But I think there is far too much at stake with the sale of these weapons right now to rush it through, and I dont think there is any downside risk if we were to say not now until we get all of our ts crossed and all of our is dotted. Lets stand up for Congresss prerogative on the sale of arms to foreign countries. Lets slow down this process that has been rushed, potentially to the great detriment of U.S national security. Lets support these resolutions of disapproval this afternoon. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire Coronavirus Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to really highlight the important work that has been underway by Members on both sides of the aisle in the Senate and Members on both sides of the aisle in the House to try to come up with an agreement to deliver urgently needed relief to address the challenges from the coronavirus that people are facing across this country. I also hope that we can work together to get this across the finish line and that Senate leadership will be willing to join in that effort. I think most of us are painfully aware of the devastating impact this pandemic has had in communities across our Nation, but the numbers do bear repeating. More than 15 million Americans have been infected with the virus, more than 285,000 Americans have now died from COVID, and we recently hit a new record high of 102,000 people hospitalized with COVID. Just to provide some context, our largest city in New Hampshire is Manchester. It has 112,000 residents. So we have enough people in the hospital across this country to fill the city of Manchester. The situation is dire. People need help. Every one of those numbers that I have referenced is much more than a number it reflects an American life, an American family, our communities. The human toll of this crisis is crushing, and we are up against the clock as our hospitals run out of beds. This crisis has been all-encompassing. In addition to the severe strains on our healthcare system, so many others are being battered by this pandemic. Small businesses are closing, and even more are on the verge of collapsing if we dont get them some help. Our transportation networks, from buses to airplanes, have been forced to lay off staff, cut routes, and in some cases just discontinue service altogether. American families are going hungry. We have all seen the long lines on the news at night showing the number of people waiting to get food from food banks. Too many people are facing homelessness. In New Hampshire, in the city of Manchester alone, we have 35 homeless encampments--35. Two years ago, we did not have that number of homeless. Parents are struggling to help their children continue their education at home, sometimes with no access to broadband or really bad access. We know women are leaving the workforce because of the strains of trying to provide support to their children and deal with the other challenges of COVID. State and local governments have been stretched to the maximum. In New Hampshire, we are facing severe budgetary shortfalls, and many of our communities may have to make some difficult decisions to cut first responders or teachers or other municipal workers if they dont get help. We hear every day the number of people who need our help, and they cant wait any longer. This is the holiday season, the end of the year. We are headed into the worst months of winter. In New Hampshire, we have restaurants that can no longer be open because they dont have outdoor seating. We have small businesses that are worried about getting through the next few months. For the past 3 weeks, we have had a group of bipartisan lawmakers in both the House and Senate--so bipartisan and bicameral--who have been engaged in good-faith negotiations to get a relief package out the door as swiftly as possible. We were able to reach an agreement on a broad bipartisan framework last week, and we have continued negotiations around-the-clock since that was announced. In New Hampshire and throughout this country, our small businesses have been some of the hardest hit by this pandemic. In New Hampshire, we are a small business State. They are the lifeblood of our economy. They account for 99 percent of all of our businesses and more than 50 percent of our workforce. In the country as a whole, two-thirds of our jobs are created by small businesses. In the bipartisan framework that we are negotiating, we have another round Page S7299 of the Paycheck Protection Program, which has been instrumental for so many of our small businesses since back in March when we passed it and created the program in the CARES Act. Overall, our bipartisan relief proposal would provide significant financial assistance for our small businesses, for our restaurants, for our live venues, which in many cases have been shut down completely, and for our childcare centers. In New Hampshire, if we dont get some help for our childcare centers, at the end of this pandemic, we will have lost fully 50 percent of our childcare centers. That means the families who depend on that childcare so that they can go to work are not going to have any safe place for their kids. I hear frequently from New Hampshire businesses that have used the PPP program effectively to keep workers on payroll and make rent that they still need more assistance if they are going to get through this winter. Our tourism and hospitality industries are particularly hard hit, and they are vital to New Hampshires economy. They are our second biggest industry. Restaurants in New Hampshire account for nearly 70,000 jobs and for 3 billion in sales, according to the National Restaurant Association. We have to provide some help for them. The future of our small businesses in New Hampshire and throughout the country hang in the balance. If we fail to act, we fail them. For many American families, the past 9 months have been the most difficult economic challenges of their lives, and the bleak jobs report last week reaffirms what we have been seeing in our communities. Nearly 10 million jobs have been lost since the start of the pandemic. That means people are out of work, struggling to put food on the table for themselves and their families, struggling to keep a roof over their heads. The eviction moratorium is about to expire. That is the story for 10 million families. In the bipartisan framework that we have been negotiating, we have urgently needed funding for additional unemployment insurance. We provide rental assistance to help not just those people who might lose their housing but also the landlords, who have been hit very hard because people havent been able to pay their rent. It also increases funding for food assistance programs to combat the surging food insecurity in our communities. We cant afford further delay in delivering these resources. The unemployment benefits are due to expire at the end of the month, and time is of the essence. One of the important areas of concern that this bipartisan proposal addresses is the need for Federal funding to help our State and our local communities. They are facing massive revenue shortfalls--at least in my home State of New Hampshire--and that threatens their ability to provide essential services. We cant afford to lose those people who provide those services, who, if they are laid off, may be forced to go someplace else and wont be available when we have the money to rehire them. We cant afford to lose the teachers, and already we are seeing too many teachers who are retiring or leaving the profession because they are worried about safety and exposure, or they dont have the resources to be able to do the online teaching that is required now. If we dont get this funding out the door, we are going to see more of those losses. In New Hampshire and in our cities and towns, they are being stretched to the limits. We are at the precipice of this crisis. Cases are continuing to go up. Hospitalizations are going up. The death toll is going up. People need help, and they need it now. In New Hampshire, our nursing homes have been especially devastated by this crisis. We have the highest percentage of COVID deaths in our long-term care facilities of any State in the country. Eighty-one percent of our death toll has been tied to nursing homes. Our bipartisan relief framework includes necessary Federal support for the Provider Relief Fund, and it allocates urgently needed help for our nursing homes that are on the frontlines. We also provide help to address substance use disorders and mental health. What we have seen across the country is that COVID-19 has exacerbated what already existed in the opioid epidemic. We were beginning to make some progress in New Hampshire and in many States across the country until the coronavirus hit, and now we are seeing that progress being lost. Our plan bolsters support for Federal investments in a number of programs that respond to the substance use disorder crisis in our communities, and it also addresses suicide prevention. This pandemic has created significant burdens for those who are struggling with substance use disorders. And, of course, we have heard the number of mental health issues has been greatly exacerbated. Our bipartisan plan addresses three of the most important pieces of the strategy to get on the other side of this pandemic testing, tracing, and vaccine distribution. As overwhelming as this crisis has become, we cant just throw our hands in the air. We have to continue to prioritize robust testing and contact tracing so we can track and contain community spread. Of course, we need to follow the CDC guidelines--wearing masks, maintaining social distancing, staying home as much as possible, hand washing--so that we can help flatten the curve and help our hospitals. And now, as we are, we hope, just weeks away from having a vaccine, we need to ensure that every measure is taken so we are ready to go on day one. The manufacturing and distribution of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine are critical to putting an end to this pandemic, to reopening our economy, and to restoring normalcy in our society. Our COVID framework boosts funding for each of these three priorities. When the Senate came together during the early days of this crisis, we worked in good faith to deliver the CARES Act that provided relief to Americans throughout the country. We did it before, and I believe we can do it again. This bipartisan framework is the only bipartisan measure in Congress. It is the only bicameral measure in Congress. It is the only proposal that has an opportunity to clear both Houses. We arent done, obviously. Negotiations are ongoing. There are a lot more people who have to see this work and, hopefully, will decide to support it, and we still have more concerns to sort out. But this is a compromise. It doesnt have everything I want to see. It is not what I would have written if I had been able to write it by myself, but it is a compromise that I believe we can get majority support to pass. Of course, it is step one. It is a relief bill to help Americans stay afloat over these next very difficult months, and our work doesnt end if we can provide this relief. We are still going to need a stimulus bill to get our economy moving again. But, right now, the most urgent need is to address those concerns that individuals and families have. If Congress fails to act and get this over the finish line, the consequences will be dire. Our hospitals are already overwhelmed. Too many small businesses are closing. Families are going hungry and facing homelessness. Inaction is really not an option. We need to get this done. There is no reason we cant come to an agreement. We have done it before. I urge Senators on both sides of the aisle to join in this effort. I urge Leader McConnell and Leader Schumer to move forward with us to help us get this proposal over the line so that together we can deliver much needed relief to Americans and do it before the holiday season so that people will have something to look forward to. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr. Tillis. The Senator from Louisiana Tribute to Diane Deaton Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to speak for a few moments today about a Baton Rouge and Louisiana rock star. I am talking about Baton Rouges own Diane Deaton. This week, Diane announced that she is going to retire from her post as a weather forecaster at WAFB-TV, which we refer to as Channel 9, where she has served on 9News This Morning and on Early Edition for many years. Diane is known--widely known--affectionately as Queen D. She has been reporting the weather for the people of Louisiana, particularly Southeast Louisiana, for 37 years--37 years--and all Page S7300 at the same station. Over a WAFB career spanning, what, nearly four decades, Diane has become a beloved fixture in our State and in our State capital. Her compassion has been on regular display--and not only in the way that she has walked Louisianians through hurricanes and tornadoes. Weather is important to us in Louisiana. Diane has invested in first and second graders at Buchanan Elementary in East Baton Rouge Parish through an extraordinary program called the Reading Friends program. She has built new homes for families through Habitat for Humanity, where she currently serves as a board member. Diane has been a part of LSU Tiger HATS pet therapy program. That is a program where she and her colleagues visit young patients and their families at one of our leading hospitals, Our Lady of the Lake Childrens Hospital. Dianes awards are many. I wont list them all, but they include the Louisiana Association of Broadcasters Lifetime Achievement Award, the Holly Reynolds Humanitarian of the Year Award--that was from the Capital Area Animal Welfare Society--and the Ulli Goodman Volunteer of the Year Award from the Baton Rouge Ballet Theater. I dont know how she finds the time, but Diane is also certified as a Delta Society Pet Partner for her work using therapy animals. Yet I noticed that Dianes announcement was characteristically humble as she steps away after 37 years. Here is what she said I have never taken for granted the honor and privilege you have given me over these many years by choosing me and my colleagues here at WAFB-TV to keep you and your family safe and informed. I think that the gratitude among Louisiana and Baton Rouge residents is certainly mutual. I am glad to hear that Diane will not be leaving our great State. I want to emphasize that. She is going to retire in Louisiana, and I hope she enjoys every moment--every single moment--she gets to sleep in after December 18. No one can argue--no fair-minded person can argue-- that she hasnt earned a rest, even though her familiar weather forecast will be sorely missed in a State that takes more than our fair share of beatings from Mother Nature. I thank you for the chance to honor Diane Deaton. I thank you for the chance to honor Diane Deaton for all of her hard work on behalf of everyone who relies on WAFB-TV for news and for everyone in Louisiana and Baton Rouge whom her volunteer work has touched--and that numbers in the hundreds of thousands. Diane, may the years ahead bring as much joy to you as you have brought to our State and our community. God bless you. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas National Defense Authorization Act Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, for many years, I have supported the annual National Defense Authorization Act. The bill always contains many worthy provisions, and it usually passes with large majorities. After all, who wants to vote no when the common refrain to pass the bill is Support the troops? But at some point you have to draw the line, and this year is where I draw it. Just look at these bills over the last few years. Five years ago, the NDAA was 968 pages--not unusual around here and something you can get your hands around. But last year, the NDAA report was 1,794 pages, and this year the report is an astonishing 4,517 pages--not even counting the classified annexes. I doubt anyone really knows what is in it except maybe some lobbyists. And get this As the bill grew more than sixfold in length, we had even less time to read it. The number of people who could read the bill at any one time was restricted. Social distancing--Cant have too many people in the room, we were told. That is fine. I understand. We are still in a pandemic. But then we should have had more time to review the bill, not less. Yet Armed Services Committee members were asked on this floor last week to sign the bill after having only a couple of hours to review it. As this massive bill was written in secret and then rushed to a vote, some seem to have forgotten to consult with the Commander in Chief or recall that he has veto power. It is pretty well known that the President wants the bill to reform or repeal section 230, the giveaway to Big Tech oligarchs who get to censor the American people without consequence. The bill stiff-arms the President. There is not a word in more than 4,500 pages about section 230. The sponsors claim they couldnt airdrop provisions into the bill at the last minute. I take the point. I am not sure the President will, though, and he is the one with the veto. But there is more. The bill condemns the President for proposing to move some troops out of Germany and restricts his ability to do so, even though NATOs frontier has shifted hundreds of miles to the east and Germany hasnt exactly carried its share of the NATO load. The Senate didnt debate this major policy change. Our earlier bill didnt even mention it. As far as I am concerned, this provision was, to borrow a phrase, airdropped without appropriate consultation with committee members. And for the record, I am a senior member of the committee, but I only learned about this provision in the newspaper on Friday, 2 days after I was asked to sign the bill. It would appear the standard for airdropping provisions into the bill is that we wont airdrop things that support the Presidents priorities, but we will airdrop stuff that thwarts his priorities. I doubt that will get past the Presidents veto either. This failure to consult committee members is not an isolated incident. The Presidents 5G plan released valuable but unused spectrum owned by the government. The Pentagon protested mightily but only with vague evidence. We had a hearing on this issue, and it sharply divided committee members. Yet, again, this bill disrupts the Presidents plan, and, again, we learned about it only after the fact. Another thing that happens behind closed doors is broken promises. We were promised last summer that the radical Warren amendment wouldnt survive the conference committee. Not only did it survive not a single word was changed. You may have heard about the Warren amendment. You probably heard that it would merely rename some Army bases that are named after Confederate officers. There is no harm in having that debate. I have always found it curious that we dont have a base named after say U.S Grant or John Pershing. Yet the Warren amendment is far more radical than merely renaming a few bases. The amendment explicitly applies to all military property. That is a lot more than bases. It includes military museums, service academies, and cemeteries. Do you think I am exaggerating? I am not. Read the bill no exceptions for museums, for academies, even for cemeteries. Let me give you just one example. The West Point library contains portraits of Grant and Lee in close proximity, two commanders of the Civil War, juxtaposed as todays cadets learn the history of our Nation, our Army, and their own school. But that painting may have to come down. So I suppose tomorrows cadets may learn that Grant defeated an unnamed enemy with an unnamed commander and accepted surrender from no one at Appomattox. But if you really want to see the radical consequence of the Warren amendment, just look across the river to Arlington National Cemetery, our Nations most sacred ground. Those gardens of stone stretch in symmetrical rows across the horizon, except for a single odd section laid out in circles, rather than rows, and with pointed headstones, rather than rounded ones. The 482 graves in Section 16 contain the remains of Americans who rebelled against our country. That section also contains a memorial to those who died in that rebellion. We should be grateful that those rebels and their cause lost on the battlefield. Yet we should also be mindful of the historical context of this patch of our most sacred ground. Section 16 of Arlington was created as a symbol not of secession but of reconciliation by the very men who had fought for the Union. President William McKinley--a decorated veteran of the Union Army, promoted three times for battlefield valor--oversaw its creation. In a display of magnanimity, he declared--in Page S7301 front of the Georgia legislature, of all places--that the Federal Government would assume responsibility for Confederate graves. He then signed a bill authorizing the reinterment of Confederate soldiers at Arlington. Senator Warren apparently believes that she knows better how to handle the legacy of our Civil War than did the Union veterans who bled and defeated the Confederacy on the field of battle, or even Barack Obama, who continued a longstanding Presidential tradition in 2009 of sending a wreath to the Confederate section of Arlington on Memorial Day. If the professor gets her way, a crane may drive into Arlington and rip out the memorial whose history dates back to President McKinley and which was honored just a few years ago by President Obama. Again, I am not exaggerating. In the committee markup, Senator Warren said that is exactly what she wants to happen. And if that happens, maybe the professor will be applauded in faculty lounges, but my perspective is a little different. I served at Arlington with the Old Guard. My soldiers and I laid to rest our Nations heroes. A lot of those funerals started in Section 16. Before those funerals started, we talked sometimes about that odd section and the war that occasioned it. After all, the Army has a lot of amateur Civil War historians. We were proud to wear the uniform of and be the heirs to Grant and Sherman and Sheridan--the great warriors who saved the Union and vindicated freedom and equality for all. We also had a little humility. We didnt presume that we knew better than Grant and McKinley how to heal our Nations wounds after the Civil War, or that we knew better than Abraham Lincoln, who called for malice toward none, with charity for all. Maybe Senator Warren and the Jacobins in our streets repudiate the wisdom of Lincoln and Grant and McKinley. Perhaps they think Lincoln should be canceled. A mob tried to tear down his statue just a few blocks from here last summer. Too many of these Jacobins condemn our Nation as racist to its core. They look at the Confederacy and see not a rebellion against America but the true heart of America. So, naturally, their iconoclasm doesnt stop with tearing down statues of Lee but moves right away to statues of Washington, Lincoln, and Grant. They tried to tear down those last summer, too, if you recall. I will never stand by while Jacobins tear down statues of Washington, Lincoln, and Grant, nor will I support a bill that permits a crane to drive into Arlington and desecrate that sacred ground. We celebrate the triumph of the Union and the cause of freedom and equality and the defeat of the Confederacy, but why does it follow that we have to rip paintings off the walls of libraries and museums and tear down war memorials in Arlington National Cemetery? And I suspect a lot of other Senators wouldnt support this bill either if they knew what it does. And that takes me back to a larger problem. We were promised this radical language wouldnt be part of the final bill, but that promise was discarded behind closed doors. Now, we have a 4,500-page bill at the last minute in the rush to fund the government and pass another coronavirus relief bill before the holidays, all with the Presidential veto hanging over it. An overlong bill negotiated behind closed doors, dropped at the last minute, major policy shifts without consensus or even much debate, broken promises, wishful thinking about a veto threat--these are the hallmarks of an NDAA process that has deteriorated rapidly in recent years. That has to change. If it doesnt change this month, mark my words, it will change next year. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Tribute to Doug Jones Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, sadly, I return to the floor today to say farewell to another Member who will conclude his time in the Senate at the end of the term, the junior Senator from Alabama, Doug Jones. We all know Doug came to the Senate as a storied courtroom lawyer and U.S attorney, but fewer people know about his more humble origins. Doug was born and raised in Fairfield, AL, just outside of Birmingham, the son of a steelworker, the grandson of a coal miner. When he was 19 years old, he spent his summer working at the local cotton tie mill, 10 hours a day, 6 days a week. One day, a freak accident sent a bit of shrapnel flying his way, and he came within inches of losing an eye. Several stitches later, Doug went right back to work--early evidence of a stubborn streak. Only at the end of the summer did Doug decide it was time to focus a bit more on his studies. That same work ethic--the sometimes stubborn work ethic--followed him his entire life. He brought it next to law school. On the one occasion Doug decided to skip class, it wasnt to throw a pigskin around the quad or engage in some extracurricular activity with friends. No, Doug skipped class to attend the trial of the Klansman ringleader of the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church, a tragedy that had shaken the conscience of a nation. A young Doug Jones was moved by the disposition of justice in that trial, but he was left with the impression that other members of the conspiracy had escaped the reach of the law. Only a scriptwriter could have imagined that 24 years later, that law school truant would become the U.S attorney in Alabama and that his office would uncover the evidence to bring charges against two more Klan members involved in the bombing, and that 40 years after that awful crime, Doug Jones would win the conviction of the remaining conspirators, delivering a long-delayed yet righteous justice. History would repeat itself a few years later, when Doug would again find himself at the center of events. Doug was eating breakfast one day just blocks away from the scene of the bombing of the All Women Health Clinic. He took charge that day and made sure that investigators and first responders worked together in perfect unison. Doug would later go on to secure the indictment of Eric Rudolph, the perpetrator of that heinous bombing, as well as the Olympic Park bombing 2 years later. Of course, not every one of Dougs cases involved matters of life and death. The U.S attorneys office once prosecuted local officials for trying to steal an election by bribing absentee voters with cash, beer, and a little liquor for good measure. Now, if only the defendants had known about Dougs affinity for bourbon. Kidding aside, kidding aside, those years revealed for Doug something profound about public service and government You can have the best laws in the world in principle, but it takes dedicated effort to make the law work for everyone in practice, to take our ideals of justice and equality and fairness and opportunity and make them real in the everyday lives of citizens. Doug brought that revelation with him to this Chamber. He worked with his trademark determination to finally repeal the widows tax. He helped pass legislation to permanently fund historically Black colleges and universities. He has worked across the aisle to combat veteran suicide, strengthen the VA, and support our military bases--so important to the great State of Alabama. Not every issue would be so easy or so bipartisan, especially for a new Senator facing a difficult reelection, but every time Doug approached a politically sensitive vote--and I marveled at this--he was untroubled. He would do what he always did He would act on principle. He would vote his conscience--politics be damned. President Kennedy had a phrase for Senators whose abiding loyalty to their conscience triumphed over all personal and political considerations. He called them profiles in courage. Doug Jones is a profile in courage for our times. But before I get carried away with too many grand compliments, it is important to remind colleagues that Doug Jones, as a human being, is just a joy to be around. Just ask his good friend, the Senator from Montana. More than once Doug would catch Senator Tester giving an impassioned Page S7302 speech on the floor and think to himself I will bet you he didnt turn his phone off. Let me give him a ring and see what happens. Laughter. Just look at Dougs office, festooned with memorabilia of every particular Crimson Tide footballs and keepsakes from his favorite bands. You can go see his rocking chair--one of those southern-veranda, sweet-tea-drinking chairs--and baseballs signed by Presidents, statesmen, and most impressively to this Yankee fan, Joe DiMaggio. If Doug Jones has one hobby besides hunting, it is autograph hunting. He has managed to collect a signature on a baseball from every Senator in this Chamber today, including its newest Member. The junior Senator from Arizona was sworn in only a week ago, but 5 seconds after he lifted his hand from that Bible, there was Doug to congratulate him, furnishing a clean baseball, ready for Mr. Kellys John Hancock. That is Doug Jones--someone who never let the immense pressure of this job change who he is, someone who has made life a joy for everyone in our caucus, and someone who understands that, at the end of the day, we get sent to this Chamber to make life better for our constituents, to do it courageously even when the odds are not in our favor. I will end with one final story. Several years ago, Doug was asked to participate in a stage adaptation of his favorite work of fiction, To Kill a Mockingbird, which, of course, includes his literary icon, another great Alabama lawyer, Atticus Finch. Hearing Dougs life story, you would be forgiven for thinking it was ripped from the pages of that Harper Lee classic, so perhaps it was fate that one day Doug would be asked to play a part in that story. There was just one hiccup Doug was asked to play the judge. So he never got to deliver that passage, shortly after the death of Mrs. Dubose, when Atticus explains to his son that real courage is not a man with a gun in his hand real courage is when you know youre licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and see it through no matter what. You rarely win, but sometimes--sometimes--you do. Doug spent his time in the Senate--indeed, his whole life--embodying the courage that Atticus describes. The story of the 16th Street bombings is a reminder of the fact that even against tremendous evil and seemingly impossible odds, if you are dogged and determined and see it through no matter what, sometimes you do win and justice prevails. So while Doug didnt get to play Atticus Finch that weekend at the Virginia Samford Theater in Birmingham, that is OK. It was already the role of his lifetime. Doug has said that it is the greatest honor of his life to fill the seat of his mentor, Senator Howell Heflin. Doug, you upheld the honor of that seat, and you have set an example for every Senator who will follow in it. Whatever the next chapter of your life may bring, the entire Senate Democratic family wishes you and your family the very, very best and politely requests that you do not call us when we are in the middle of giving a speech. Laughter. I yield to my friend, the very distinguished and wonderful, wonderful, wonderful junior Senator from the great State of Alabama. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama Farewell to the Senate Mr. JONES. Mr. President, I thank the minority leader for those remarks. I am humbled. You know, everyone knows the old saying My, how time flies when you are having fun. My time here has drawn to a close, but despite the difficulties, the challenges, despite the rancor that we often see in this body, as well as Washington, DC, I can honestly say I have had a lot of fun. The last 3 years have been amazing, and I have loved being a Member of this body. I actually was able to accomplish a few things, thanks to you. But you have been fun you have not just been kind. It has really been good. By the way, your staffs have been awesome. I know you hear that a lot from constituents. Maybe you dont hear it enough from other Senators. Your staffs have been amazing to us, and I really very much appreciate it. You know, as the minority leader said, everybody knows I am a baseball fan. If you go into that office, you will see in my reception area all 100 baseballs that I had signed. And it was fun getting them-- either here on the floor or in a committee room, at the retreat that the Democrats had. There were so many who had never signed a baseball, and you figured out that it wasnt easy to sign a baseball. Laughter. And even those who signed in their office, when we sent them to their office, they always came up and talked about it. It was a time to put politics aside and just talk a little bit--something we really dont do enough of around here, leaving the weighty politics and responsibilities that we have just to sign a baseball and talk about how much fun it was. I remember, right after I was elected, I was talking to a friend of mine, dreaming big about the things that we could accomplish that would make a difference in the lives of the people of Alabama and the people of America. We talked about the possibility that we could work on a bill as important as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or the Voting Rights Act of 1965. But I knew--I knew, though--that such opportunities were not likely, especially in what I knew to be a 3-year window and not knowing what the future would hold--although, I have got to be honest, I had a pretty doggone good idea when I got here. If there was one thing my momma always taught me, it was to be realistic about things. I knew it was going to be tough, but to even have an opportunity to talk and work on things that bring such transformational changes--those kind of things come along once in a generation, if we are lucky. They are that legislative equivalent of a perfect game in baseball. You are lucky if you get to be part of that in your career, but you always have to hope and you have to strive for the possible, not just the likely. For those of you who really dont know about baseball--there may be a few--a perfect game is just that nine innings, three outs, three up, three down. Everything has to work together in synchrony. It is not just the pitcher who throws balls and strikes it is the outfielder who catches the fly it is the second baseman who has to get the out and throw the runner out at first. Everyone has to fall in line and work together as a team--as a team. And it is not just that it is the people on the field. They are all working and they are all striving for the same goal. As it turned out, I didnt get a chance to be part of a perfect game. I didnt think I would, but I didnt get that chance. Sometimes I worry, as many of you do--especially if you listened to the farewell speeches of Lamar Alexander and Tom Udall and Mike Enzi and others--you worry if those perfect games can ever be had in this Senate again. I worry about that. But we always come close, and I came close. Right after I got here, I got invited to be part of the Common Sense Caucus, which I had to explain to people in Alabama that that is really not an oxymoron, that there is common sense up here. But within 6 weeks of being up here, I was at Susan Collins office with so many here--some 20 Senators, Republican, Democratic--talking about immigration, working on immigration reform. It was the hottest topic of the day, an important topic that is still important today. I just marveled at the fact that here I was, 6 weeks into this, and I was in that room being a part of those discussions. What was even more astonishing to me is that people actually wanted to hear what I had to say. That didnt happen, having raised three children, been married. I dont always get that, when people want to know what you have got to say. But they did, and I was so gratified, and I was so honored. We would meet in Senator Collins office. We would meet in hideaways. It was exciting. And we came so close. You all remember that? We came so close, within about three votes of doing what they said couldnt be done, of doing something that was possible but not probable. That sense, what I saw of my colleagues, is why we ran for the Senate. Page S7303 I could see it. I could feel it in those rooms, in those discussions. I could see it on the floor that day as people were voting. It is why we wanted to be in this body. I remember sitting in the cloakroom, and I was as disappointed as ever when we failed. And for a long time, probably still to this day, when I am asked What is your most disappointing day in the Senate? I will always talk about that vote that failed so close, which was so important. But what it did demonstrate is, through that effort-- effort--that anything is possible. You have got to come close sometimes before you get across the finish line. You have got to play in the red zone a little bit before you get the touchdown. You have got to hit that line. But whatever we did, it is possible. The Senate is capable of great things, if we do them, of bridging divides that society may view as too wide to cross. We can do that. It is not that wide between here and there. It is not that wide, and people need to know it and respect it. I am not the first and I certainly will not be the last to talk about the importance of bringing people together who hold opposing views and working toward what is both possible and palatable. But all too often the desire to do that kind of gets lost among other actions that dont quite match the words that we say. I noticed the other day how many heads were nodding in the farewell speech of Senator Alexander, Senator Enzi, and Senator Udall. And then what happens? I have looked at a lot of farewell speeches in the last month. They all say a lot of the same things, and everybody, I am sure, nods. We have got to do better. You have to do better. I dont think I fully appreciated it. And I listened to the minority leader talk about where I come from in Fairfield, but I dont think I fully appreciated it until fairly recently. It seems like I just kind of love a lost cause. It seems like every time that there is something that needs me there, I am there--fighting for justice for others, for others who feel like hope is lost, from the church bombing case to a Senate election in Alabama. I fought for those causes because I believe in hope. I believe in redemption. I believe in the possibility. Some may call that naive, and many have, but I have not been afraid to touch on the so-called third rail issues of our political system because I believe that, right now especially, there is no time for caution. My first speech on the Senate floor was about gun violence. No one could believe a Senator from Alabama actually talked about how we can stop gun violence in a way that made some sense--not from an extreme view on the right or an extreme view on the left but right there in ways that made sense. It was a topic that I knew could have easily been twisted into a negative campaign ad--which, by the way, it was. Laughter. We saw it coming. But I also knew action was so important. We took some small steps on that issue over the last 3 years, despite a lot of political pressure to the contrary, and I hope you will do more in the years ahead because lives will depend on it. Everything doesnt have to be a perfect game. There is great satisfaction in the day-to-day triumphs. You can and we did hit a home run or two and more than our share of singles and doubles. I am really proud of the 20-plus bills that I led or co-led, bipartisan bills, that have been signed into law over the last 3 years. None would have been possible without bipartisan work. One of my first original bills, the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act would never have become law without the commitment of Senator Cruz to help bring long-overdue closure to the victims of those terrible crimes. I see Ted in the back. I appreciate Senator Cruzs involvement in that. I will have to say, it was so much fun, after we got that done, to go back home and tell that to all my Democratic friends. What is your proudest? I said Well, the proudest moment right now is with my partner, Ted Cruz. They said Aha. But it shows what is possible, folks. And it was an important bill. None of those bills have meant more to me, though, than the bipartisan effort that I led with Senator Collins to eliminate the military widows tax that for almost two decades had deprived widows of full survivors benefits that they deserved. So many of you went to bat for that bill Senator Reed, Senator Inhofe, and others. You were getting a lot of pressure, not from me or Susan Collins. You were getting pressure from a lot of those military widows. They had been up here for 20 years, and for 20 years the dollars and cents had prevented that from becoming a reality. We fought on that because we knew what we were doing was right. We knew it was right that you could not put a price on the duty we owe to the men and women of our armed services and their families. I will never forget that day in December when we passed the NDAA that included the elimination of the widows tax. In the Gallery, there was a large group of Gold Star widows who had been up here for 20-plus years to try to get that done, never being able to reach the goal. And on that day, we did it. You did it. Susan and I got a lot of credit, but it was this body, with the help of some folks in the House, that made it happen. That was just one of the memorable days on the floor. Swearing-in day was unbelievable--simply an explosion of emotions. To walk on the floor as a U.S Senator, some 37 years after I left the floor with my old boss as a young staffer to my mentor Howell Heflin, and to take the oath of office for his seat was just really a remarkable circle of life. There are two especially significant things about that day too. One is that I hope that you all recognize by now that the freshman class of 2018 will likely go down in history as one of the greatest freshman classes ever. The team of Smith and Jones cant be beat. It is as American as apple pie. I was really proud and honored to be there with Tina Smith that day. I was also honored, if you recall, that there were three Vice Presidents on the floor of the Senate that day. Now President-Elect Joe Biden escorted me in. Former Vice President Walter Mondale escorted Senator Smith. Mike Pence, the current Vice President, swore us in. And, actually, if you now think about it, we had a fourth--soon-to-be Vice President Kamala Harris. That is a pretty remarkable time--pretty remarkable. It was also a remarkable day when what I hope is going to be a new tradition in the Senate took place When we had on two different occasions, once each year, six Senators--three Democrats and three Republicans--reading Dr. Kings Letter from a Birmingham Jail. That document remains one of the most significant in American history, and it is as important today as it was when it was written in 1963--and, in some ways, maybe more important for the moment we find ourselves in. I have asked--and I know he will do this--my colleague Senator Brown to carry on that tradition in my absence. And then there was the day of the swearing-in in January of 2019. I was here to observe, to pay my respects to all those who were returning and for those who were joining. And as I was standing in the back by the cloakroom, Senator Tester walks up and says Jones, what are you doing? You cant get anything past Tester. There were probably a few profanities ladened in there as well, if you know Senator Tester. I said Well, Jon, what do you think I am doing--with probably a couple of other kind of milder profanities. He said Look, Daines is caught in a snowstorm back home and cant make it here, and I would like for you to escort me down when I take the oath. As it turns out, it is likely to be the only time I get to do that-- and it was a true honor, my friend. Simply sitting at this desk is perhaps the greatest thing, taking this place in and watching each of you, noting the bipartisanship, especially as we close the Congress--especially as we close this Congress--and how Senators move freely from one side of the aisle to the other. Occasionally, I will tell you, I confess, that I just come back here by myself, and I will open this drawer and will read the names of the Senators who sat here John Kennedy, Ed Muskie, Hubert Humphrey, my colleague Senator Shelby, and so many others. And it is just overwhelming. Page S7304 You know, growing up, it was always the Presidents or Presidential candidates who captured my attention. I knew the names of some Senators, but that began to change for me watching the Senate Select Committee on Watergate when I was in college. It was a remarkable time and a remarkable committee. And then everything changed again in 1979 while I was studying for the bar and got a phone call from Senator Heflins chief of staff, Mike House. I had campaigned for the judge. Mike offered me a 1-year position on Heflins Judiciary subcommittee, which I eagerly took. That year not only changed my life but brought about a respect for this body, for the Senate--as an institution, as individuals, and for so many of its Members--that I had never had before. From that point on, folks, I was hooked. I was hooked on this body--before being elected to the Senate. And now I have come to love the Senate a lot and, importantly, all of the possibilities that go with it, which is why I dont really want to spend my last moments on the floor talking about what I have done. I want to talk about what needs to be done, what can be done, what is possible. You know, even back in 2017, people said it was just not possible to elect a Democrat from Alabama to the U.S Senate--and here I have been. It is possible to make affordable quality healthcare a reality for all Americans. The ACA right now is the best hope and only plan that is out there. As President Obama said--and everybody should do this--if there is a better plan you can come up with, put it out there. Lets do it. I will publicly support it. The goal is healthcare for everyone in some way. There are so many in this country and in my State of Alabama who desperately need it-- before, during, and after this COVID crisis. It is possible to give people in remote and rural areas access to healthcare, but it is going to take a lot of work, and it is going to take getting out of partisan corners. It is possible to provide a quality education to every American child. I know education is often funded locally, but it is possible to do it. You just have to roll up your shirt sleeves and get it done. It is possible to extend broadband--access to broadband--to all Americans and bring every man, woman, and child into the modern era, just like we did--the Congress did--with Franklin Roosevelt in the Rural Electrification Act in the 1930s. Broadband is the new power. It is possible to do that. High speed and affordable, that is key-- affordable broadband. It is possible to ease the burdens on working-class Americans by setting a minimum wage that is not going to hamstring businesses but will raise the quality of living for so many in this country. So many in my State are in poverty, but yet they work. They work. They work hard, but yet they are still below that poverty level. We need to do what we can to lift them out of that poverty. It takes a lot of work. It takes hard work. It is possible for law enforcement to serve and protect all Americans--not just some--to root out the systemic racism that exists within law enforcement by enlisting the support of both law enforcement and the communities. It is possible. I will candidly tell you another great disappointment was when we let that moment pass this summer--hoping that with a new President, maybe a new Senate, maybe a new Congress, we could get something accomplished. I hope that that still happens, but I was disappointed we let that moment pass this summer when all of the country and all of the world was behind us to say Please do something. Please do something that we have known about for decades, for centuries. Please do something. Law enforcement said Lets do something. We let it pass. But it is never too late to do the right thing. It is never too late for justice. It is possible to ensure that every eligible voter is able to cast a ballot and have it counted. Now is the most important opportunity we have seen in 2020--concerns about our election process that it might have been stolen that there might have been fraud. Use that opportunity to say Lets dont let these allegations have any credence going forward. Lets get together. The technology is there. Figure out a way that together we can make our election safe and secure and that all people will have access to the ballot box--all people who are eligible to vote in this country. It is possible for our system of justice to treat all Americans equally--not just talk about it, but to do it. It is what I have tried to do throughout my career. It is possible. And this is going to be a challenge. It is possible to restore the American peoples faith in government. And we all know right now that that faith has been shaken for many, many reasons. The faith has been shaken, but it is possible to restore it. It is possible for each of us to learn--as Atticus Finch taught us--to see things from another persons point of view, to walk around in their skin or in their shoes, to see things from others point of view, to find that common ground. It is possible for us to realize that deep down that progress is not a zero-sum game, that a rising tide lifts all boats. These things are not easy. They take dedication and hard choices, but they are worthy goals. I know many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are dedicated to the same goals, and though I wont be able to cosponsor anything with you from this point on or debate the amendments in committee--if you get amendments in committee--I am going to support you in whatever efforts I can, no matter what side of the aisle your desk is on. And I will keep working toward the same goals too, even after I leave this place. Remember, though, as we get into the vitriol, as we get into political rhetoric--just remember the Jones law of politics, adapted from Newtons third law. Just remember that for every action, even in politics, there is an equal and opposite reaction. If you go too far on one side or the other, you are going to get a reaction on the other side, just as hard. And that makes it harder and harder to reach that common ground. You know, in Senator Browns book about his desk and the people in his desk, he quotes the political philosopher Hannah Arendt who observed The good things in history are usually of very short duration, but afterwards have a decisive but a short time of influence--a long influence--over what happens over long periods of time. A short time--and I know you may be thinking, well, Doug was only here 3 years so that is what he is talking about. But I am not. In history, I am looking at something bigger--whether it was Martha McSallys 2 years or my 3 Senator Gardners 6 Senator Udalls 12 Senator Alexanders 18 or Enzis and Roberts 24 or, if you are like Pat Leahy, since Moses was in the bulrushes. Our time here is short. There is not anybody on this floor right now who is not thinking about their time since they were sworn in and said that it was just like yesterday, because it was. Our time is short. It is of a limited duration, and we have to act like that. We have to make sure that every day we are moving. It has been a realization of a long-held dream. I have so many to thank Doug Turner, who is here Joe Trippi, on my campaigns and my late friend, Giles Perkins and an amazing family my bride Louise, my rock my two boys, Carson and Christopher, who have wanted to kill both me and Louise since they have been living at home during the pandemic. They have been incredibly supportive. And then my daughter Courtney and her husband Rip and her two beautiful girls, my granddaughters, who are still the brightest stars in my sky, Ever and Ollie. I am grateful to each of you, my colleagues, and all that you helped me with. I am grateful to an amazing staff. I am not going to go all the way through it. They have been true rock stars. I am going to enter something into the Record about my staff. I am grateful for the advice and counsel of Alabamas senior Senator and an old friend, Senator Shelby. While Richard and I may disagree on many policies, we share a commitment to the people of Alabama to make sure that we do all we can to get the people in Alabama the quality of life that Page S7305 they deserve, and I so much appreciate Richards service to the people of the State of Alabama, his long and distinguished service--which started out as a Democrat, by the way, just saying. That is where the seed was planted, folks. I also want to mention briefly the chairmen of the committees I worked on Senator Crapo, Senator Inhofe, Senator Alexander--who was one of the first people who helped me come over--and the work that we did together. You pulled me and helped me. Senator Collins, who chaired the Aging Committee. But I am especially grateful for the ranking members of those committees Senators Brown, Casey, Murray, and Reed. Their friendship and counsel have been invaluable. Of course, I want to thank the minority leader for all of his work for me and on behalf of me. And as I think you guys know--not always the people of Alabama--Senator Schumer never tried to put puppet strings on me. I know I got accused of that, but he never ever tried and, for that, I am very grateful. To the people of Alabama, I promised to do my best to represent each of you, whether or not you voted for me, and I am proud of the work that we did on your behalf and that I have accomplished on your behalf. Thank you to the people for giving me the honor of serving you as your Senator. Finally, I am going to resist the urge to tell you what is wrong with the Senate, how it operates today. You hear it virtually every time a Senator gives a farewell address, and, instinctively, you know it deep down. But I will offer you this. There is a book I finished reading recently that Ira Shapiro, a former staffer, wrote. Many of you may remember or know Ira. He wrote a book called The Last Great Senate. It ought to be required reading for every Senator coming in. It was published 8 years ago, about the two Congresses during the Carter administration and how they operated--Bob Byrd as majority leader, Howard Baker as the minority leader, how they got things done for the American people. The author laments that the Senate doesnt operate today in that fashion. I was here for one of those years. Senator Leahy was here during that time. His closing is even more important today as it was when the book was published. He said America is adrift in turbulent and dangerous waters. Facing enormous challenges at home and abroad, we urgently need our once-vaunted political system to function at its best, instead of at its worst. To be sure, it is more difficult being a senator today than it was in the 1960s and 1970s. The increasingly vitriolic political culture, fueled by a twenty-four-hour news cycle, the endless pressure to raise money, the proliferation of lobbyists and demanding, organized interests are all well known, and they take a toll. But all of those factors make it more essential that our country has a Senate of men and women who bring wisdom, judgment, experience, and independence to their work, along with an understanding that the Senate must be able to take a collective action in the national interest. Please remember that as you go about the countrys business remember that as you go about the Senates business remember that as you go about your business as a Senator. And as you do, keep and preserve the reverence that the Founders envisioned for this body. As former Majority Leader Mike Mansfield once said, The constitutional authority . . . does not lie with the leadership. It lies with all of us, individually, collectively, and equally. . . . In the end, it is not the Senators as individuals who are of fundamental importance. . . . In the end, it is the institution of the Senate. It is the Senate itself as one of the foundations of the Constitution. It is the Senate as one of the rocks of the Republic. Something we should all remember. One more little bit of advice. Take out the word negotiation when you are talking about legislation. Dont talk about negotiating this bill or that bill, whether it is COVID relief or even appropriations. It works, but let me tell you what is happening out there, what is happening out there with the people. They hear those words, and they think this is some side or the other trying to get an advantage. It is like labor and unions. It is like a civil or criminal lawsuit. Somebody is trying to get an advantage to try to do things for their own interests. We can talk about it from the Democratic side of how we are working for the people we are negotiating for the people. We can talk about it from the Republican side that we are negotiating for patriotism and businesses to make sure they are protected. But what is being heard by the American people is this is all about Democrats this is all about Republicans and getting that political power. Talk about common ground. Talk about sitting down with the administration or whomever and finding common ground. Talk about the goals that you agree on and how to get there. Negotiation is just a bad word, and I hate that, but it is. As I prepare for the next chapter of my lifes journey, there is a sadness of what I am going to leave behind, but there is also optimism--optimism, the glass half full, the men and women who serve in this body and their successors and the staff who support them. And I emphasize that, again, the staff who support them. Leading together will continue to bring a better future for the American people, for your constituents, for each of us together, not as a caucus but together as a Senate. You are just a damn, unbeatable team. You are an unbeatable team. May God bless you all. May God continue to bless the United States of America. Mr. President, with a deep sense of humility and gratitude, I say for the last time, I yield the floor. Applause, Senators rising. The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr. Cotton. The Senator from Alabama. Mr. SHELBY. What a good speech here. We dont hear them like that every day. To my colleague Senator Jones, 3 years was not a long time here, but we feel his presence. I can tell you that I have known Doug a long time. I remember I came to the U.S House when he came up to work in the Senate for Senator Heflin in the Judiciary Committee and so forth. I supported him when he was nominated by President Clinton to be the U.S attorney in the Northern District of Alabama, where he did a tremendous job. I worked with him day after day, as we all do, on a lot of issues that affected the country but affected, especially, our State of Alabama at times, and we worked hand in glove. We have become friends. We have our differences, but we also have a lot of things that he talked about today where we would come together for the State and for the country. I wish him well. I think we will hear more from him in the weeks ahead, in the months ahead. I certainly hope so. He has a lot to give. He has a great family. He has a great wife in Louise and a great partner there. He has a great staff and we worked together and we will continue to do this. But one theme--and I like that he kept expounding on it here today-- that if we work together in the Senate, Republicans and Democrats, we get things done if not, things dont happen. I wish Senator Jones Godspeed and wish him the best Mr. President, today I would like to speak about my fellow Alabama colleague and friend, Senator Doug Jones. I have known Doug Jones since he was a young staffer working for Senator Howell Heflin on the Senate Judiciary Committee. During his 3 years as a Member in the Senate, I believe we have worked well together. He and his staff have shown a lot of professionalism and class while in Washington. He is respected by all of his colleagues on both sides of the aisle. While we may not agree on every policy, Doug understands the Senate and respects the institution. It has been an honor to serve with him. Annette and I have enjoyed spending time with Doug and Louise, and we wish them all the best. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana. Mr. TESTER. I am going to be very, very short. The truth is that serving with Doug Jones has been a once-in-a- lifetime opportunity for me. This guys last name shouldnt be Jones it should be Justice. He is somebody like nobody I Page S7306 have ever seen, whose moral compass is so tuned into right that it has just been an incredible pleasure for me to be able to serve with him and to know him and to also wish him the best moving forward. I dont think we have heard the last of Doug Jones. Doug is not the kind of person who will shrink away. There will be another moment where he can exhibit his ability of common sense, as he has done here in the U.S Senate for the last 3 years. I am deeply going to miss his friendship and his ability to sort the wheat from the chaff because he has been able to do that from day one and continued today with his farewell speech. I just want to say, God bless you, Doug Jones, and God bless your family. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I heard a lot about Doug Jones before he got here from another courageous former U.S attorney, Hal Hardin from Nashville. I was not disappointed when he arrived. Doug Jones reminds me of another former Democrat who was very effective in the Senate, Ted Kennedy. Ted Kennedy would come on the floor and make the most--well, no one could ever say he abandoned his principles, based upon his speeches. He would stand back there in the back, and the things he would say would rally any Republican Lincoln Day Dinner. In fact, all I had to do back in Tennessee to stir up the Republican crowd was to mention Ted Kennedy. I did that on a regular basis. However, when I made my maiden address, without my knowing it, Ted Kennedy went around and got 20 cosponsors for the legislation I introduced that day, and I got a good dose of what it means to be an effective U.S Senator, somebody who sticks to his or her opinions but, at the same time, who knows we are here to try to work on some sticky issues and get a result that most of us can vote for and that the country can accept. In his time here, Doug Jones did that. I got to watch him because he was a member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Senator Kennedy used to chair that committee, working with Senator Enzi, Senator Gregg, Senator Hatch, and others to produce a lot of legislation. He used to say that committee has one-third of all the jurisdiction in the Senate. Maybe that is about right. Doug Jones was one of the newest Senators. We have 23 members. He was way down at the end of the line, but I noticed he always came and he always asked questions and he always listened. He seemed to me to be trying to say what he believed but learn from the witnesses how to get a result. Let me just mention one contribution he made that I think will stick with him and with the people of Alabama and this country for a long time. That was the work we did in 2019. Senator Murray and I, Doug Jones, Senator Tim Scott, Senator Bennet of Colorado were on it from the beginning to do two things at once that helped low-income Americans who wanted to go to college. The first was to simplify the dreaded FAFSA, the Federal Aid application form that 20 million Americans fill out every year that is 108 questions long. About 90 of them are unnecessary everybody agrees. For years, we have been working on that to try to simplify it. Finally, we got a significant part of that done. Doug Jones played a major role in that because what that legislation did was to say to the low-income family in Alabama or Tennessee or Arkansas or Illinois--wherever--you dont have to send your tax information into the Federal Government twice and let them then see if they can catch you making a mistake and hold up your Pell grant for 2 months while you figure that out. All you have to do is check a box, and the Internal Revenue Service will fill out the tax questions on your Pell grant application for you so that there is no chance of making a mistake. That made a big difference. And at the very same time, we agreed--Republicans and Democrats--to permanently fund historically Black colleges. It was a goal that had been there for a long time. So I would say to my friend from Alabama that I hope he puts that on his wall somewhere because that helps a few hundred thousand low-income families in Alabama alone. There is some work still to be done on that to finish the job, to finish the FAFSA simplification, and there may be some other support for historically Black colleges that we might even be able to get done while you and I are still here. Yet I wanted to acknowledge a Senator who arrived, went to work, stuck to his principles, worked across the aisle, and got results. You cant have a much better scorecard than that. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia. Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I also rise to acknowledge my dear, dear friend Doug, but I do it in a different vein. So many good things have been said, and I think anyone who knows Doug or who has paid attention to what has been said today had found it has been very accurate as far as his having a commitment to the rule of law and his compassion for any person, especially for those who havent had the same opportunities as all of us have had in life. That is what has moved us all. Yet I have gotten to see him in a different light. He and Louise invited me down. I got to campaign with them, and it was all about Alabama. I got to go down and spend a couple of days. That tells you of the true person. It not only tells you what he believes and what he feels for the people of his State and how he represents them, but it truly tells us what the people of his State think of him. I saw it firsthand. I saw it at a football game. Now, Nick Saban and I grew up together in a small, little coal mining community. I want you to know that Coach Saban and Terry, his wife, send their best. They want to thank you for your service. To see the fans gather around Doug and to see the happiness that he and Louise had when we were just out, going through the tailgates, was a wonderful, wonderful sight. That tells me everything about his purpose for being here. I hope those in Alabama know how truly fortunate they are to have this gentleman, who loves Alabama with every fiber and bone in his body. He has given them everything he has and has represented their State better than any State I have ever seen represented with the true passion that he has. I love you, buddy. Thank you The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have had the privilege of serving with many, many Senators of both parties and with very many whom I have applauded. Some stand out specially--some for their longevity and some for who they are. Doug Jones stands out for who he is. I think, in listening to his work as a prosecutor--of course, that is near and dear to my heart in my having been a prosecutor--I had never faced what he had. I think of his discussion of the summation he gave in the trial of the people involved with the bombing of the church in Alabama and the killing and maiming of youngsters. In fact, I had a chance to meet one of the survivors of that with Doug, and I saw how she had felt about him all these years later because he had had the courage to stand up and do something that may not have been popular with some in his State, but that had been the right thing to do. In all of the years I have known him here, what he has done has been the right thing to do. Now, I have only had one objection about him. He showed me a picture that was taken when this young man, Doug Jones, was working for Howell Heflin--Judge Heflin, as I recall. They were standing there with these gray beards, and this Senator from Vermont asked Who is the youngster in the picture? Senator Jones, thank you for bringing that. I know Ann Berry, in my office, got a kick out of that because she had the opportunity to work with you. We have done things that we have been able to joke about, like being in an airplane, where he was sitting in the front and I was sitting in the back. Fortunately, it was on the ground. Senator Jones hollered out to somebody, one of the military people there Where is the button for the ejection seat for the back? It caught my attention. Page S7307 I have also seen this man sit there and try to discuss legislation. He would ask How will that help people? I dont want this because it is politically beneficial to me. How will it help people? I have heard about towns now in Alabama that I had never heard about. I have also heard things he would tell me about that would make me think of towns in Vermont and make me realize we were talking about the same problems. Never once would he say These are Republicans or these are Democrats. He would say These are people in Alabama who need help. So we would work on that. I will speak further about this, but, Senator Jones, I think of you and your wonderful family. I think of the trips you and your wife and my wife and I have taken together, and I feel that I have been a better Senator for knowing you and traveling with you and listening to you. I will miss you, my friend, and I will speak further on this. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there is something about this Doug Jones. From the earliest stages in his life, he knew he was going to be a little bit different. When I grew up in East St. Louis, IL, it was expected that my childhood hero would be St. Louis Cardinals great Stan the Man Musial. But when you grew up in Fairfield, AL--also a baseball fan as a boy--it turned out that your childhood heroes included Joe DiMaggio, Roger Maris, and Mickey Mantle. I am not sure how that goes over in the Deep South, to say that you are rooting for a team called the Yankees. But you did it, and you knew from the start, in your youth, that you were willing to strike out and do the radical, controversial thing. You were 9 years old in September 1963 when four members of the Ku Klux Klan bombed the 16th Street Baptist Church in nearby Birmingham, killing four innocent, young girls who were not much older than you were. Fourteen years later, you were an idealistic, young law student who skipped class to sit in on the trial of the ringleader of that church bombing. You were mesmerized when listening to Alabamas then- attorney general--the lead prosecutor in the case--tell the jury It is never too late for justice. The jury agreed and convicted the bomber. You would go on to marry Louise, and God blessed you with three beautiful children--two sons and a daughter. Yet the memories of those four little girls who were killed in their church never left you. In his eulogy for the four fallen girls, Dr. Martin Luther King said that the girls say to each of us, Black and White alike, that we must substitute courage for caution. They say to us that we must be concerned not merely about who murdered them but about the system, the way of life, and the philosophy which produced the murderers. Their deaths say to us that we must work passionately and unrelentingly for the realization of the American dream. I am sure a lot of people heard those words and nodded, but you heard those words, and you were inspired. In 2001, as the U.S attorney for the Northern District of Alabama, you led the successful effort to try and convict the remaining two coconspirators in the church bombing. Both men were sentenced to life in prison. In that same office, you coordinated a joint State-Federal task force that led to the indictment of domestic terrorist Eric Rudolph. You advocated that Rudolph should stand trial first in Birmingham for the deadly bombing in that city of a womens health center before being tried in Atlanta for the Centennial Olympic Park bombing. All told, these and other bombings killed 2 people and injured more than 150. Rudolph pleaded guilty and was sentenced to four life terms in prison because of your commitment. I was honored, during the course of the campaign, Doug, to do a joint fundraiser with you and Louise and Loretta, my wife. I got to sit out on my deck in Springfield and listen to Jason Isbell and Joe Walsh. It was a lot of fun that night. Sometimes campaigns are fun. It certainly was to be with you and Louise on that particular night. I want to close by saying that you shocked me on the floor of the Senate with your first speech. I couldnt believe that this new Senator from the State of Alabama would give a speech about guns and gun violence. It really told me all I needed to know about you right then and there. You are willing to stick out your neck for something you believe in, even if it is going to be controversial and even if you are going to catch hell for it, because you believe in it sincerely. I know you are a proud hunter and gun owner, and there is no question in my mind about your views on that issue. Yet, after the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, FL, that took the lives of 49 young men and women--one of the worst mass shootings in the Nations history--you supported tighter background checks for gun sales and raising the age requirement to purchase a semiautomatic weapon. I want to personally thank you, as well, for showing exceptional political courage in cosponsoring my DACA legislation in the Dream Act. I will never forget it. I am also proud that you were an original cosponsor of Justice in Policing. That wasnt an easy one either for anybody and for you especially, but you stood up for what you believed in. That is legislation that I joined in introducing with our friend Cory Booker and soon-to-be Vice President Kamala Harris. So you have left your mark. It may seem like a short time in the Senate, but there are those who have served for much longer who have a lot less to show for it. You told us who you were on your first day, and you proved it every day thereafter. It has been an honor to count you as a colleague. I know that you are going to continue to find ways to bend that moral arc of the universe toward justice, and I look forward to supporting you in every way that I can in that goal. I wish you the best. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Coronavirus Relief Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, I came to the Senate 2 years ago because the people of Florida entrusted me to fight against the broken ways of Washington and the out-of-control spending that is threatening the future of our children and our grandchildren. I am fighting every day against the political class in Washington-- the same elites that scoff when people like me say that government needs to be run like a business. They say government is too complicated to run like a business, but I say that any elected official or government bureaucrat who believes that should resign tomorrow because they are part of the problem. It is time to wake up. It is time to wake up to the fact that every dime spent in Washington belongs to American taxpayers, and every dollar spent now is a tax increase for a future generation. It is time to wake up to the fact that our Nation is more than 27 trillion in debt. Every cent we spend moving forward threatens our ability to fund our military and our safety nets like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. It is time to wake up to the fact that our position as the leader of the free world is not promised and shouldnt be taken for granted. Irresponsible career politicians who care more about their next election than the future of our country will run this Nation into the ground if we let them, and I am fighting like hell to make sure they dont. Now, let me be clear. I support another relief measure to help our small businesses and individuals who are hurting because of the coronavirus. For months, Senate Republicans have been trying to pass responsible and targeted measures to quickly help those in need. And for months, Democrats have blocked these measures because of politics. Nancy Pelosi admitted it. She said she purposely stood in the way of the deal until after the Presidential election so that politics would be in their favor to avoid considerations in the legislation that we dont want. It is shameful and exactly why the American people are fed up with Washington. Page S7308 Congress has already allocated 2 trillion in direct and indirect aid to States and localities. And we know, unfortunately, because Congress tried to get this money out the door as quickly as possible, many programs within the CARES Act are riddled with waste, inefficiency, and fraud. Now a group of my colleagues want to spend another trillion dollars, including almost 200 billion to bail out liberal States with Governors who cant do the basic job they were elected to do--manage their own budgets. And we dont even know how much is still unspent from the previous coronavirus relief packages. I have reached out to every single Governor--twice now--to learn exactly how they have spent the hundreds of billions of dollars they have already received, and only 10 have replied. They wont tell us because they dont want us to know there are still billions of dollars left unspent. They dont want us to know that the real purpose is to take taxpayer money meant to help get through this crisis and use it to backfill their inefficient and wasteful budgets and pension programs. Liberal Governors and mayors around the country think the American people are stupid. They think taxpayers in States like Florida wont realize if the Federal Government uses their taxpayer money to bail out States like New York and California and pay for those States wasteful spending. Governor Newsom has had his hand out for a bailout despite the fact that Californias tax revenues for this fiscal year are running 9.9 billion or 18.6 percent above projections. Personal income tax revenue in October was 1 billion--15.6 percent higher than in the previous October i California, and sales taxes were up 9.2 percent. For the last 4 months, overall revenue in California has exceeded spring forecasts and even 2019 collections. This is a State that paid 1.5 million to the chief investment officer of its public pension fund, who was actively investing in companies tied to the Chinese Communist Party, only to later find out this person was personally invested in companies with ties to the Chinese Communist Party. You cant make this stuff up. How is that for pension waste and a national security threat? It is the same story with Governor Cuomo. New Yorks overall tax revenue was up 4.3 percent in September compared to September 2019. These are the same Governors who are OK issuing new stay-at-home orders that are killing small businesses. As long as they get more money from the Federal Government to backfill their budgets and pension plans, they dont care how many people in their States have to suffer. These Governors and mayors dont care, as long as they dont have to follow their own oppressive rules. Lets not forget about Nancy Pelosi and the hair salon, California Governor Gavin Newsom dining at the French Laundry, Austin Mayor Steve Adler encouraging constituents to stay home from his timeshare in Mexico. Do as I say, not as I do. These liberal politicians who refuse to open their States or spend taxpayer money wisely are seeing high numbers of unemployment. Most of the States with the highest unemployment rate in the country are controlled by Democrats. On the other hand, Republican-led States that are making the hard choices to get on a fiscally responsible path and reopen their economy safely are succeeding and seeing lower unemployment rates. Thirty States have halved their unemployment rate since May, while real GDP grew 33 percent in the third quarter, erasing losses from the previous quarter. You can see there, this is from a Wall Street Journal editorial--if you havent heard, states are experiencing a surge of-- tax revenue. Politicians dont want this good news to get out because they want to get more of our money from States like Florida to pay for the budgets of Illinois, New York, California, and New Jersey. You can see the GDP growth of 33 percent in that quarter. Over here you can see States have seen a big drop-off in their unemployment rates by half over the last 6 months, and there has been a big growth in private sector employment, but it doesnt stop these liberal Governors and mayors from wanting more money. Look, I know everyone wants to help our States, and so do I. We help our States by ensuring appropriate spending of the billions of dollars in taxpayer dollars already allocated. We help our States by safely opening the economy and getting Americans back to work. We help our States by sending money to schools to safely reopen and funding vaccine research and distribution. Most States will be in a strong position to get through this pandemic without more Federal aid, and that is great news for our country. But we know New York, California, Illinois, New Jersey dont need bailouts they want bailouts so they can use that money intended to address the fallout from COVID to backfill their longstanding budget problems and their pension problems. I have said all along that I will not support that. It is not fair to the citizens of States like Florida, where over my 8 years as Governor, we made the hard choices--they were hard--that put our State on a fiscally secure path. We paid down our State debt. We cut taxes. We balanced our budget every year without borrowing money. And 908 billion--908 billion--of spending today equals a tax increase of 7,000 per American family down the road. It is not money that we have. It is a tax increase of 7,000 per American family down the line. Many families in our country right now are trying to figure out how to celebrate this holiday season while they struggle to afford daily expenses. These are people we need to be helping. You wouldnt run your business or family the way Washington is run-- like there is an endless supply and no consequences to racking up unthinkable amounts of debt. That is what many of my colleagues want. But to keep spending money like this means taking away the same opportunities that I have had and others have had to live the American dream, and it will take it away from our children and our grandchildren. It is time to wake up. It is time to make the hard choices to put our Nation on a path to recovery--recovery from this virus, from the economic devastation it has brought with it, and from the fiscal calamity that decades of politicians have ignored. That includes refusing to bail out wasteful States for their decades of poor fiscal choices I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri. S.J Res. 77 Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, later today, we will vote on whether to go forward with the arms sales that the administration notified the Congress of a few weeks ago. These would be arms sales to the United Arab Emirates, equipment sales. These sales clearly would continue the 20 years of growth in our relationship, working side by side against common concerns and common enemies. This really goes back through three different administrations, going back to 911 and beyond, where the UAE has consistently been willing to stand with us in at least six long-term deployments. They come they stay. They are side by side with us in the field. They have been with us in the air. They are flying what has previously been our best piece of aircraft at a level that we would share it with other countries that are friends of ours. This sale will continue that. It continues to allow even more interoperability between the United States and the UAE and Israel. Israel, by the way, is totally supportive of this sale. The Ambassador from the United Arab Emirates and the Ambassador from Israel earlier this week had a public event where they both talked about the support of Israel for this sale. As you know very well, our law requires a quantitative advantage for Israel when we sell them equipment. We have even a slightly different advantage, but being able to continue this relationship is important. The F-35 jets, the MQ-9 unarmed aerial vehicles, advanced munitions-- I think the total sale is about 23.5 billion. And this is not any kind of gift from the United States to the UAE. This is the UAE making a purchase totaling 23.5 billion for equipment that Page S7309 is made by American companies and almost always by American workers. In August, we had the first breakthrough in a diplomatic sense in the Middle East in a long time. President Trump deserves credit for that. Israel deserves credit for that. But the UAE deserves credit for that. The Abraham accords, where the UAE formally recognized Israel, began to have flights back and forth and other things that were significant in changing the environment in the Middle East, the most difficult part of the world--the greatest breakthrough in 40 years. But that followed a number of breakthroughs that werent quite as public, where this relationship has grown--the Israel relationship with the UAE--just like our relationship has gotten stronger over time. To see the recognition of the two governments together, to see Bahrain follow that--I think we are going to see other countries in the area decide that a region that lives in peace with Israel is a good thing for everybody involved, not a bad thing for anybody. So it is important. I think how the Congress deals with this is significant. We have been notified as the law requires us to be notified. Under this notification process, I dont believe any sale has been denied, and only one sale has been altered. The President has to agree. So if we debate this for hours and somehow it narrowly passes and the President vetoes it and we dont have the votes to override the veto, which I am confident we would not have--in fact, I think we very likely have the votes to go ahead and deal with this right here, right now. It is the right thing to do. It is the right time to do it. We will never have more of a long-term runway of how things under the Bush administration, the Obama administration, and the Trump administration have continued to progress to where the UAE has become a trusted ally. Now, they have become a trusted ally and a trusted diplomatic partner in this important breakthrough. Having this kind of equipment not only allows us to be interoperable, but frankly, it creates the opportunities for American military and American technicians to be working with them every time you have an upgrade, every time you have a significant maintenance issue. That just further enhances, as does working through how that equipment is used afterwards--all of that further enhances the constant dialogue, the constant reinforcement of our friends who see common enemies and are working directly to move their country and their region in a much better direction. I hope that the Senate today does what it needs to do and sends that message that we understand what Israel would like to see happen, what the UAE would like to see happen, and, frankly, what will happen and happens better if this debate focuses more on what that outcome produces, rather than a debate that makes people wonder exactly what do you have to do to continue to be a trusted partner of the United States. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I would restate my request, whenever I come to the floor, that the Presiding Officer wear a mask because he has people sitting in front of him that could be at risk. Remembering Paul Sarbanes Mr. President, this weekend, we lost a former Member of this body who truly embodied the spirit of service that should animate all of our work. His name is Paul Sarbanes. He passed away a few days ago. He was a longtime chair of the committee of the Presiding Officer. As chair of the Banking and Housing Committee, he was always a voice for consumers and working families, standing up against powerful corporate interests. The accomplishment that bears his name, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, was a landmark law in our efforts to hold corporations accountable. It helped protect Americans who invest hard- earned money for retirement and for their kids education from corporate banking fraud, the kind that bankrupted families after scandals like Enron. Senator Sarbanes also never ignored the housing part of our committees jurisdiction. He fought to make sure that all Americans could find and afford a place to call home. Whenever developers tried to make a deal in Maryland, he was always adamant they include affordable housing in their projects because, fundamentally, he never forgot where he came from. The son of Greek immigrants, Paul Sarbanes grew up a working-class kid, bussing tables at his familys restaurant on the Eastern Shore. In the Senate, he cared about getting results for the people he served, not about getting the credit. Some of his colleagues called him the stealth senator. He welcomed the nickname. He told the Baltimore Sun that stealth is one of the most important weapons in our military arsenal. . . . If you let somebody else take the credit, you can get the result. Senator Sarbanes was the definition of a true public servant. May he rest in peace as he joins his beloved wife Christine. Connie and I pray for Representative John Sarbanes, his son, and the entire Sarbanes family. I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring Senator Sarbanes by building on his legacy, standing up to the corporations that have too much power in this country, and fighting for the working people we serve. Paul Sarbanes, like many others in this body, understood the dignity of work National Defense Authorization Act Mr. President, yesterday the House overwhelmingly passed the NDAA conference report by a veto-proof majority of 335 to 78. That bill includes our comprehensive bipartisan reform of our anti-money laundering laws. I would like to thank my colleagues, especially Senator Crapo and other Banking and Housing Committee colleagues Senators Warner, Jones, Reed, Rounds, and off the committee, Senators Wyden, Whitehouse, Graham, and Grassley, and the Presiding Officer, Senator Cotton, for his work on this legislation. On the House side, Chairwoman Waters and Chairman Maloney and Representative Cleaver, thank you to all of them for working so hard to ensure that today we have this crucial bipartisan legislation in this defense conference report that will reform our money laundering laws and finally end abuses by anonymous shell companies. I would like to extend my thanks to a former colleague, Chairman Levin, who was chair of Armed Services and the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations and to President Obama, who both voted on these issues for years. Many of their good ideas are codified in this bill, harvesting some of the seeds they planted years ago. The Anti-Money Laundering Act and the Corporate Transparency Act are the products of months and months of bipartisan negotiations between and among Members of the House and Senate and certainly the staffs of Senator Cotton and me and Senator Crapo and others. I thank them for their good work. The bill is a critical step to fight money laundering and crack down on shell companies. While there are things I would have done differently had we been writing the bill on our own, overall, it is an effective and comprehensive response to the problem of illicit finance. I strongly support it. Criminals abuse the U.S financial system to launder money from drug trafficking, organized crime, Medicare and Medicaid fraud, weapons sales, and other criminal activities. I spoke today about this with Sheriff Burke of Toledo, the Lucas County Sheriff, a longtime sheriff, and U.S Marshal Pete Elliott of Cleveland of the Northern District. They welcomed this language, and they welcome this law. This will help them do their jobs better. Much of this dirty money that comes from organized crime in Medicaid fraud, weapons sales, drug trafficking, and sex trafficking is laundered through anonymous shell corporations. These are not victimless crimes. They directly hurt Ohio communities, especially those torn apart by the opioid crisis. Sinaloa cartel actors and Fentanyl traffickers have been destroying thousands of families. They use money laundering to get their drug money in and out of the country. Human traffickers who prey on runaways at truck stops along major interstate highways in Ohio and across the country also use the financial system to launder their profits. We need to give law enforcement new modern tools to stop their crimes. Page S7310 The bill finally requires comprehensive reporting by U.S companies of their actual owners--no more hiding these abuses in anonymous shell companies. It cracks down on bankers who look the other way to actively aid money laundering and cracks down on Big Banks that have shoddy compliance systems. If you are helping drug traders hide their illegal fentanyl profits, you deserve more than a slap on the wrist. Banks cannot be too big to jail, and laws cant treat them that way. I will closely monitor how this critical legislation is being implemented. I spoke this week already with the Secretary of Treasury designee and the Deputy Secretary of Treasury designee about being ready to administer and enforce these laws. I look forward to working with the administration to ensure that Treasury puts in place effective anti-money laundering and corporate transparency rules to implement the bill as soon as possible. We know that criminals have long been revising their tactics to get around our current laws. This bill will enable us to get ahead of them and stay ahead of them. I urge my colleagues to support it. They supported this language in the NDAA, and I ask them to support the NDAA Taken together, as we designed them, these measures reform, update and strengthen our current anti-money laundering laws and make critical changes to U.S corporate disclosure laws to combat abuses by owners of anonymous shell companies--including foreign owners from China, Russia, Iran, North Korea and other countries--who have for years been exploiting our system for criminal purposes. The legislation strengthens the Treasury Departments financial intelligence, anti-money laundering AML, and countering the financing of terrorism CFT programs, modernizing our legal regime and improving communication, oversight, and information-sharing in these areas. The conference agreement requires much more routine and systemic coordination, communication, and feedback among financial institutions, regulators, and law enforcement, to enable them to identify and act on suspicious financial activities, better target bank resources on critical AML tasks, and increase the likelihood of bad actors being caught by law enforcement. It also provides for new whistleblower protections for those reporting BSA violations and provides for payment of whistleblower rewards. It establishes tough new penalties on those convicted of serious Bank Secrecy Act violations, including additional penalties for repeat violators, and imposes a ban on financial-institution board service for those convicted of egregious BSA-related crimes. It would require important new reporting from the Department of Justice and Treasury to better enable Congress to oversee the use of-- and sometimes continuing violations by banks under--deferred prosecution agreements and non-prosecution agreements, which too often are a slap on the wrist by regulators for banks that evade sanctions, violate our AML rules, or otherwise violate banking laws. As I have said, banks cant be too big to jail, and regulators cant treat them that way. To help accomplish all these goals, the conference agreement authorizes additional funding for the Treasury Department, and we expect the Department to insist on strong accountability for results and to be responsive to congressional oversight as its officials work to implement this legislation. In addition, the bill finally requires comprehensive reporting by U.S companies of their actual owners. No more hiding in the dark abuses by anonymous shell companies to commit crimes. Unlike in most areas of reform and transparency, where the U.S has led the way, on this issue of anonymous shell companies we have long lagged behind other nations, and failed to require uniform and clear ownership information for firms at the time of their incorporation in the states. This information is critical to law enforcement. In the U.S investigators often have to spend precious time and resources issuing subpoenas and chasing down leads--sometimes jumping from anonymous shell company to anonymous shell company--to secure basic information about who actually owns a company. That makes no sense. And with this bill, it will end. Treasurys National Money Laundering Risk Assessment estimates that around 300 billion in illicit proceeds from domestic financial crime is generated annually. Criminals have for a very long time abused our financial system to launder funds gained through narcotics trafficking, organized crime, Medicare and Medicaid fraud, weapons proliferation and other criminal activities. Much of this dirty money is laundered through anonymous shell corporations. Over the years we have heard all about these abuses, from the Panama Papers to the Paradise Papers to, more recently this year, the series of news articles called the FinCEN files. These exposures of abuses in our system by dedicated journalists and national and international transparency organizations have highlighted problems involving human trafficking, drug trafficking, terrorism, money laundering, fraud, tax evasion, and other crimes involving illicit finance. None of these abuses are victimless crimes. Money laundering for drug cartels has a direct line to the opioid crisis in Ohio, where Sinaloa cartel actors or fentanyl traffickers have been destroying thousands of families. Combined with the pandemic, these drugs have hurt thousands of Ohio families. Human traffickers who exploit the misery of runaways in truckstops along major interstate highways in Ohio and across the country use the financial system to launder their profits. Medicare fraudsters cost the taxpayers 2.6 billion in one recent year, according to the HHS Inspector General, and tarnish the reputation of this lifeline for seniors. Thats why anti-money laundering and corporate transparency laws are so critical they protect the integrity of our financial system, provide critical intelligence to law enforcement to combat crime and help give victims the tools they need to hold bad actors accountable. Under Treasurys existing rules, banks are already working to secure some of this information from accountholders when they open accounts. And while banks must continue to play a key monitoring role, its also important that we finally, after all these years, require companies to provide basic information on their ownership when theyre formed. The bill contains a strong definition of beneficial owner which includes a two-part test covering individuals who, directly or indirectly, exercise substantial control over an entity or hold or control an ownership interest in the entity. The definition is clear that a nominee, intermediary, custodian, or agent acting on behalf of another individual cannot be the beneficial owner of an entity. Nominees are not beneficial owners neither are trustees or attorneys acting as agents. The definition is also clear that employees do not qualify as beneficial owners of an entity unless, apart from their employment status, they hold an ownership interest in the entity or can exercise substantial control over the entity such as the ability to transfer some or all of the entitys assets or earnings to their personal use. The provision defines beneficial owner as an individual who directly or indirectly owns or controls not less than 25 percent of the ownership interests of the entity. When applying this part of the test, FinCEN must consider what to do if no one individual meets the 25 percent minimum, and how that situation may trigger the second part of the beneficial owner test which requires disclosure of the individuals who exercise substantial control over the entity. To determine whether an individual exercises substantial control over an entity, FinCEN is not intended to devise a numerical, narrow, or rigid test. Instead, the standard is intended to function with flexibility to take into account the myriad ways that an individual may exercise control over an entity while holding minimal or even no formal ownership interest. They include written and unwritten agreements, arrangements, or understandings, instructions to company directors or officers, letter of wishes, Page S7311 control over personnel decisions, economic pressure on company shareholders or employees, coercion, bribery, threats of bodily harm, and other legal and illegal means of exercising control. Evidence that one or more individuals are exercising substantial control over a specific entity is expected to vary widely and may encompass such matters as emailed or telephoned instructions from the individuals suspected of being beneficial owners or their agents, employment or personnel decisions made at the direction or with the approval of such individuals, financial accounts that name such individuals as signatories, investment decisions made at the direction or recommendation of such individuals, or transfers of funds or assets to or at the direction of such individuals. Requiring companies to provide their ownership information and storing it in a secure federal database like FinCENs, alongside account holders banking information, will help address longstanding problems for U.S law enforcement. It will help them investigate and prosecute cases involving terrorism, weapons proliferation, drug trafficking, money laundering, Medicare and Medicaid fraud, human trafficking, and other crimes. And it will provide ready access to this information under long-established and effective privacy rules. Without these reforms, criminals, terrorists and even rogue nations could continue to use layer upon layer of shell companies to disguise and launder illicit funds. That makes it harder to hold bad actors accountable, and puts us all at risk. The bill also contains certain exemptions. The basic justification behind the bills exemptions is that each exempt category refers to entities that already disclose their beneficial owners to the government in one way or another and so dont need to duplicate that disclosure in the FinCEN database. For example, publicly traded companies already disclose their true owners to the SEC, and banks already disclose their true owners to federal bank regulators there is no reason to require those entities to disclose the same information to FinCEN. Each of the exemptions should be interpreted as narrowly as possible to exclude entities that do not disclose their beneficial owners to the government. Exemptions created for pooled investment vehicles, dormant companies, and certain nonprofits require especially narrow interpretations to limit those exemptions to entities that provide some level of ownership disclosure to the government. The exemption for pooled investment vehicles is intended to be available only to PIVs that rely for investment advice and services on a regulated bank or on a securities broker-dealer, investment company, or investment adviser that is registered with the SEC, has disclosed its own beneficial ownership information to the federal government, and has filed a Form ADV disclosing the PIVs legal name and any other information related to the PIV that the federal government may require. In addition, PIVs formed under the laws of a foreign jurisdiction must file with FinCEN a certification identifying every individual that exercises substantial control over the PIV, providing the same information required for beneficial owners. Because evidence shows that criminals, fraudsters, and U.S adversaries are increasingly using PIVs to launder funds and commit other wrongdoing, this exemption is of special concern and should be subject to continuous, careful review by Treasury as provided in the new 31 U.S.C 5336i to see whether it should be retained or removed. The exemption for dormant companies is intended to function solely as a grandfathering provision that exempts from disclosure only those dormant companies in existence prior to the bills enactment those grandfathered entities are also required to immediately disclose their beneficial owners to FinCEN as soon as their ownership changes hands, they become active entities, or they otherwise lose their exempt status. No entity created after the date of enactment of the bill is intended to qualify for exemption as a dormant company. The exemption provided to certain charitable and nonprofit entities also merits narrow construction and careful review in light of past evidence of wrongdoers misusing charities, foundations, and other nonprofit entities to launder funds and advance criminal and civil misconduct. This exemption is intended to apply only to entities that are engaged in charitable or nonprofit activities, and not to entities engaged in for-profit businesses or for-profit activities. The exemption is based, in part, upon provisions in U.S and state laws that enable federal and state officials to regulate and investigate nonprofit organizations to ensure, for example, that the individuals behind them are not using the entitys assets to inappropriately enrich themselves, unfairly compete against businesses that pay taxes, or advance other inappropriate objectives. In addition, the exemption given to entities that operate exclusively to provide financial assistance to or hold governance rights over a charitable entity is intended to be even more restrictive it is confined to entities that qualify as U.S persons under U.S tax law, have only U.S citizens or residents as their beneficial owners, and derive at least a majority of their funds from U.S persons--meaning the exemption is not available under any circumstance for entities formed under foreign laws, established for foreign beneficial owners, or funded primarily with foreign funds. Again, these exemptions are intended to be narrowly interpreted to prevent their use by entities that otherwise fail to disclose their beneficial owners to the federal government. To ensure the bills exemptions function as intended, the Treasury, FinCEN, OCC, IRS, SEC, CFTC, and other federal regulators should review and, if necessary, strengthen their filing forms to ensure that beneficial as well as nominal owners are disclosed to the federal government by the specified exempt entities, including investment companies, investment advisers, pooled investment vehicles, money transmitting businesses, and all entities registered with the SEC, among others. The justification for the exemption of entities that have both physical operations and at least 20 employees in the United States is that those entities physical U.S presence will make it easy for U.S law enforcement to discover those entities true owners. Like other exemptions in the bill, this exemption should be narrowly construed to exclude entities that do not have an easily located physical presence in the United States, do not have multiple employees physically present on an ongoing basis in the United States, or use strategies that make it difficult for U.S law enforcement to contact their workforce or discover the names of their beneficial owners. This exemption should be subject to continuous, careful review by Treasury under the new 31 U.S.C 5336i to detect and prevent its misuse. Extending the disclosure exemption to subsidiaries whose ownership interests are owned or controlled by one or more of certain identified exempt entities is, again, intended to be interpreted as narrowly as possible to exclude subsidiaries that never disclose their true owners to the federal government. The exemption is intended to apply only to subsidiaries that are wholly owned or controlled by one or more of the exempt categories of entities thats why the provision does not contain any reference to the 25 ownership figure that appears in the definition of beneficial owner. The Federal Reserve, Treasury, OCC, SEC, CFTC, FDIC, and other federal regulators should review their filing requirements to ensure that the entities that report to them, such as banks, publicly traded corporations, securities dealers, exchange operators, or commodity brokers, include requirements to disclose the subsidiaries they wholly own or control. This exemption, like others, should be subject to continuous, careful review by Treasury under the new 31 U.S.C 5336i to detect and prevent its misuse. For their part, FinCEN identifiers are intended to simplify beneficial ownership disclosures by eliminating spelling and naming issues that can cause confusion or mistakes related to the precise individuals or entities in an ownership chain. Page S7312 FinCEN should design rules that will encourage both individuals and entities to obtain and use FinCEN identifiers in their beneficial ownership disclosures. When assigning FinCEN identifiers to entities, FinCEN should first ensure that the entity has already disclosed its beneficial ownership information to FinCEN. An entity that has not disclosed its beneficial ownership information to FinCEN does not qualify and should not be granted a FinCEN identifier. It is critical that, from the beginning, FinCEN issue rules that ensure only one identifying number is assigned to each individual and to each entity, including all successors to a specific entity. FinCEN should also establish mechanisms to detect and correct any procedure or database field that may lead to the same individual or entity possessing or using more than one FinCEN identifier. Chairman Crapo and I agreed two years ago that we must get this done in this Congress--we must finally enact sweeping legislation to require complete ownership information--not of front men and women, not of those forming companies on behalf of those who will pull the strings from behind the curtain--but of the actual owners of companies to be available to appropriate law enforcement, intelligence and national security officials in our government who need it to combat crime. This bill lays out a system to do that simply, efficiently and effectively, without unduly burdening small businesses or others, and while providing extensive protections for the information. In Europe, that information is included in a public database. This approach is different, imposing some limits on who will have access, and under what circumstances. For example, it provides that federal agency heads or their designees--and agencies can extend that delegation as far down in their organizational chain as they like--can provide access to the database to appropriate law enforcement authorities once per investigation, so they do not need to keep repeating that authorization for the same investigation. And those delegations can be made on a bulk basis, so groups or classes of employees can be authorized to access the data as needed. For State, local or tribal law enforcement, they must get approval by a tribal, local, or state court of competent jurisdiction, which need not be a judge--it can include an officer of the court like a magistrate, court clerk or other administrative officer. While I saw no reason to treat federal, state and local law enforcement officials differently, my Republican colleagues insisted on this differential treatment, and I am hopeful that the flexibility we have built in should make it workable. It is far more workable than the scheme some had pushed, to require approval by a federal judge each time law enforcement wanted to access the database--an approach which would have gutted the bill, tied up our federal courts, and effectively rendered it inaccessible to state and local law enforcement. But the key here is a robust, functional and effective database at FinCEN to house this information and make it readily available. FinCEN should take immediate steps to create the new database needed to contain beneficial ownership information. It should use state of the art technology, procedures, and safeguards to ensure the database is secure, easy to search, easy to audit, and easy to correct and update. FinCEN should use its new hiring authority to hire the information technology specialists needed to create the new beneficial ownership database. In designing the database, FinCEN should survey other beneficial ownership databases to determine their best features and design, and create a structure that secures the data as required by law. FinCEN should ensure that federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement can access the beneficial ownership database without excessive delays or red tape in a manner modeled after its existing systems providing law enforcement access to databases containing currency transaction and suspicious activity report information. FinCEN should allow federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement to access the beneficial ownership data for both criminal and civil purposes, including law enforcement activities designed to combat terrorism, money laundering, trafficking, corruption, evasion of sanctions, noncompliance with tax law, fraud, counterfeit goods, market manipulation, insider trading, consumer abuse, cybercrime, election interference, and other types of criminal and civil wrongdoing. FinCEN should also provide appropriate access to beneficial ownership data for foreign law enforcement requesting the information for criminal or civil purposes, including appropriate requests made by a prosecutor, judge, foreign central authority, or competent authority in a foreign jurisdiction, keeping in mind that U.S law enforcement will be seeking similar information from those same foreign law enforcement agencies on a reciprocal basis. FinCEN should endeavor to design a system that will provide appropriate beneficial ownership information to foreign law enforcement without excessive delays or red tape. As part of its implementation effort, FinCEN should take immediate steps to work with states and Indian Tribes to determine how to confirm that all covered entities formed or administered by those states or tribes actually file and update the beneficial ownership information required by law. We expect FinCEN to include any resulting procedures or audits in the rule implementing the law. FinCEN should also include appropriate provisions in the implementing rule requiring federal, state, and tribal agencies to cooperate with its efforts to ensure an accurate, complete, and highly useful database of beneficial information and to provide notice of the laws beneficial ownership transparency obligations, as required by the new law. The Treasury IG should take immediate steps to establish a process to accept, store, and analyze information provided by a federal, state, local or tribal agency, foreign government, financial institution, reporting company, civil society group, the public, or others in the form of comments or complaints related to how FinCEN provides notification of the laws beneficial ownership transparency requirements, how FinCEN collects and stores beneficial ownership information, or regarding the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the information in the FinCEN beneficial ownership database. As part of that process, the Treasury IG should establish procedures that will enable comments or complaints identifying false, out-of-date, or incomplete beneficial ownership information in the database or providing correct, up-to-date, or complete beneficial ownership information in the database promptly to reach the FinCEN personnel charged with ensuring the databases accuracy, completeness, and timeliness. In addition, the Treasury IG should establish a procedure to conduct periodic audits to determine the extent to which such information actually reached the proper FinCEN personnel, was logged, stored, and analyzed, led to changes in the database, and actually improved the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the beneficial ownership database. In response to the bill, the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy should take immediate steps to revise the Federal Acquisition Regulation to require covered federal contractors and subcontractors, at an early stage in the federal procurement process, to disclose to the federal government in writing, and to update over time, information on their beneficial owners. To carry out this provision in the law, the Administrator should work with the General Services Administration to add a beneficial ownership disclosure requirement to the database authorizing entities to bid on federal contracts. At the same time it is developing regulations to implement the new law, FinCEN should simultaneously revise the existing customer due diligence rule to bring it into harmony with the new law and all proposed regulations. In doing so, FinCEN should carefully evaluate the existing customer due diligence rule and preserve provisions that do not conflict with the new law. Among other changes, the revised customer due diligence rule must use the new definition of beneficial owner established in the law. Treasury and Page S7313 FinCEN should create a transition period for financial institutions to implement the new beneficial ownership requirements. Lastly, FinCEN should also take steps to establish procedures as needed to administer the revised customer due diligence rule effectively. Updating and strengthening our AML and beneficial ownership laws will give us a 21st century system to combat these crimes. I guarantee you criminals have long been revising, adjusting and amending their tactics to circumvent our current laws. We must get ahead of them, and stay ahead of them. This bill will enable us to do that. I urge my colleagues to support the conference report and this important measure. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.","homeless, homelessness, affordable housing"

Ferr, who led Miami through a defining period of growth and tumult beginning in 1973, died at his home in the Coconut Grove neighborhood. The cause was cancer, according to a family statement. Ferr had been sick for two years, but he still showed up at City Hall in recent years, in one instance to oppose a plan to develop a waterfront park renamed in his honor. RIP Maurice Ferr was Miamis first Hispanic Mayor, and helped shape the city into the modern metropolis it is today. DATELINE TALLY Ron DeSantis makes sales call to Chicago4 via News Service of Florida Gov. DeSantis visited Chicago, less than a month after saying he would pitch Florida to financial-sector companies in the Windy City. A schedule released by the governors office said DeSantis would hold morning meetings with CME Group and Northern Trust Co. DeSantis told the Enterprise Florida Board of Directors last month that he wanted to try to lure companies from Chicago. I think there is an opportunity to talk to some folks and drive some investment here in Florida, DeSantis said during the Aug. 28 meeting. Tim Vanderhoof, senior vice president of business development for Enterprise Florida, has said a return to New York and a trip to Connecticut are also being mapped out. Ron DeSantis is making a sales call to Chicago, with future trips to New York and Connecticut. DeSantis and the war against trial lawyers5 via Michael Moline of Florida Phoenix DeSantis is firmly behind a renewed Chamber of Commerce campaign against lawyers who sue companies on behalf of consumers and said the need for a more business-friendly court system is guiding his appointments to the Florida judiciary. Businesses he has attempted to lure to Florida were aware of the states low taxes and otherwise friendly business climate but sometimes balked at the legal climate. There was a lack of trust and confidence in Floridas judiciary. There was a sense that the Legislature could enact reforms but the chance of that getting rewritten or unwound in the courts, more based on policy reasons than legal reasons, was way too high, DeSantis said. DeSantis announces over 1.4 million to City of Fanning Springs for infrastructure The Governor said more than 1.4 million in awards to tiny Fanning Springs pop. 764 would come through a Rural Infrastructure grant and Community Development Block Grant CDBG to help fund improvements expected to attract new businesses and tourists.

In the past, it was common for lobbyists, reporters and other people to approach lawmakers in the minutes before meetings started to make pitches for budget items, conduct quick interviews, or just to say hello. But the new rule and metaphorical premeeting velvet rope come amid concerns about people doing weird stuff and certain messages sent via social media platforms, according to Senate Appropriations Chair. Rob Bradley. But Bradley stressed the move wasnt because of any individuals or specific threats. There is nothing specific that has happened that I am aware of, period, Bradley said. This is long-term security planning issues. Gary Farmer says there is no conflict of interest over his relationship with lobbyist6 via Gray Rohrer of the Orlando Sentinel Farmer said he hasnt broken any laws or Senate rules by engaging in a relationship with a lobbyist and dismissed any notion of conflict of interest. Look at my voting record and compare it to her clients before you do any kind of story, Farmer said. Farmer also rebuffed the suggestion there could be a conflict of interest over his duties to the Democratic Party. Im still doing my job, man, Farmer said. Ive worked my ass off to get state Rep. Javi Fernandez in there, we got him. But his efforts to recruit a strong candidate in SD 9 have been questioned. Farmer, I dont think, is out recruiting, said Sen. Linda Stewart. I dont know who hes recruiting. GOP lawmakers mull E-Verify issue7 via News Service of Florida Two months ago, Sen. Joe Gruters said he intended to file an E-Verify proposal. But this week, he told The News Service of Florida he is not so sure. I want to hear what people have to say, Gruters said, referring to feedback he was unable to receive because of calling off a planned statewide listening tour on immigration. I will try to make a decision soon on the tour and then will make a decision on E-Verify, Gruters said. While Gruters said his hesitance is tied to the listening tour, Rep. Cord Byrd, told the News Service he would champion an E-Verify bill during the 2020 Legislative Session. Prekindergarten, early education get limelight from House committee8 via Jeffrey Solochek of the Tampa Bay Times This is where it starts. It starts with early learning, Education Committee chairwoman Rep. Jennifer Sullivan said to introduce her panels two-hour workshop. Prekindergarten should put youngsters on a track for success, Sullivan remarked. Are we doing that? That is the question that faces us today. The lawmakers heard reports on how the model currently looks, as well as commentary from providers about how it might be better. Among the things they learned was that the system needs a cash infusion, so centers can afford to pay and train their teachers, and provide the best possible services to their students. Education Committee Chair Jennifer Sullivan says that the road to success starts with prekindergarten.

STATEWIDE Hurricane Jerry gets stronger as the former Imelda dumps up to 45 inches of rain on Texas10 via Brett Clarkson, David Schutz and Tonya Alanez of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel Hurricane Jerry is about 400 miles from the Caribbean and getting stronger, according to the National Hurricane Centers latest public advisory. Beyond those two storms there were another four tropical systems of varying size and intensity scattered throughout the Atlantic tropical region, none of them a threat to Florida or the U.S. as of Thursday afternoon. The remnants of Tropical Depression Imelda are dumping catastrophic amounts of rain on parts of Texas, garnering comparisons to 2017 s Hurricane Harvey. Through Friday, the former Imelda is expected to drop up to 45 inches of rain in some areas, according to the National Weather Service. Hurricane Jerry is one of four tropical systems of various size and intensity scattered throughout the Atlantic. But none are a threat to Florida or the U.S. Dorian spins off insurance claims via News Service of Florida Though Hurricane Dorian stayed off Floridas East Coast, it has led to nearly 4,000 insurance claims and 18.8 million in estimated insured losses, according to the information posted on the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation website. In all, 3,961 claims from Dorian had been reported as of Monday, with more than half 2,288 involving residential property. The information indicates 36.5 percent of the residential-property claims had been closed. The massive Dorian caused widespread fears in Florida early this month before it steered away from the coast, sparing residents, businesses and insurance companies from costly damage. As a comparison, last years Category 5 Hurricane Michael, which decimated parts of Northwest Florida, caused an estimated 6.9 billion in insured losses, according to the Office of Insurance Regulation. Oil company wants to walk away from 30,000 gallon a day spill in the Gulf11 via Chad Gillis of the Fort Myers News-Press The most significant offshore oil leak in the nations history has been belching thousands of gallons of oil a day into the Gulf of Mexico for nearly 15 years, and more platforms may be in danger at a time when the current administration is rolling back offshore regulations and pushing to open new areas for oil exploration. Taylor Energys Mississippi Canyon site, about 19 miles off the southeast coast of Louisiana, was toppled by Hurricane Ivan in 2004 and had since been releasing upward of 70,000 gallons of crude oil a day, recent estimates show. The issue is nobody was holding Taylor accountable, said Chris Eaton with Earthjustice. Felons voting fight ratchets up at Supreme Court12 via News Service of Florida Gov. DeSantis, Secretary of State Laurel Lee, and legislative leaders filed interested party briefs defending a state law that implemented what appeared as Amendment 4 on the November ballot. But critics of the law counter that part of it requiring felons to pay fees and costs to be eligible to have voting rights restored contradicts what Floridians thought they were approving last fall. In one of the briefs filed Wednesday in opposition to the state law, the Fair Elections Center said that costs and fees are categorically not terms of sentence because they bear none of the hallmarks of sentencing, in part because they are non-punitive and simply serve to compensate the government for the costs of administering criminal justice. Theyre not listening to us. Florida families hurt by opioids oppose Purdue settlement.13 Via Ben Conarck of the Miami Herald Since losing her son to an opioid overdose nearly three years ago, Cindy Dodds has been a fervent advocate for educating public officials on addiction and destigmatizing the crisis in Florida. But even though shes been a leading voice on several facets of the opioid issue, Dodds said she and other Floridians personally affected by the epidemic have been shut out of the process as the states attorney general has negotiated to reach a multibillion-dollar settlement agreement in principle with Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin. Were very close to a settlement, and its not something any of the families want to happen, Dodds said. Theyre not listening to us We want them to face their day in court as criminals drug lords in suits. Agencies see good money for drug importation, hepatitis A14 via Christine Sexton of the News Service of Florida Top officials from six health-care-related agencies appeared before the House Health Care Appropriations Subcommittee and made pitches for spending boosts. Some of the wish-list items for next year included 15.2 million to help control outbreaks of diseases such as hepatitis A and address potential infectious-disease threats 25 million to hire a contractor to help get the states Canadian drug-importation program off the ground and 12.6 million to improve health-care data collection. Chad Poppell, secretary of the Department of Children and Families, presented a request that included 156 million in increased general revenue which is the primary funding source for state government. He said the proposal was something that he didnt lightly. DCF Secretary Chad Poppell is asking for another 156 million for drug importation and hepatitis A control. Court allows DOJ lawsuit over fragile kids15 via Jim Saunders of the News Service of Florida In a long-running dispute stemming from concerns about medically fragile children placed in nursing homes, a federal appeals court backed the U.S. Department of Justices authority to pursue a lawsuit against Florida over alleged violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act. A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 2-1 decision, overturned a lower-court ruling that said the Department of Justice did not have legal standing in the case. The issue of care for medically fragile children, who have severe health conditions, drew attention in 2012 after a DOJ investigation found Florida was unnecessarily institutionalizing children with disabilities in nursing homes. Documents Top Florida officials dont know how to verify felon voting eligibility16 via Daniel Rivero of WLRN In a sworn deposition, one of Floridas top voter registration officials repeatedly found herself unable to answer questions about who is legally eligible to vote, signaling ongoing confusion in the state agency tasked with making those determinations. Toshia Brown, the chief of Voter Registration Services At the Secretary of States office, acknowledged that since the passage of SB 7066, the state has been relying on information from the Department of Corrections that may not be reflective or up to date, in determining who is eligible to vote or not. Brown also acknowledged that it was unclear how someone with a felony conviction might be able to verify if they still owe money in fines and fees related to their case. No one regulates CBD vape products in Florida even as usage raises serious concerns17 via Samantha Gross of the Miami Herald A shocking seven deaths and 530 hospitalizations in 38 states have spurred state lawmakers to propose raising the legal age to buy vaping products, and the states health and education departments are readying to roll out a three-hour anti-vaping course for Floridas schoolchildren. While the state Department of Business and Professional Regulation regulates tobacco, and the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Division of Food Safety regulates ingested products like CBD food and drink, the state is left with a major question.

Under state control, Florida Virtual School hires new executives with ties to GOP leaders18 via Leslie Postal and Beth Kassab of the Orlando Sentinel In the spring, Gov. DeSantis and lawmakers disbanded the virtual schools independent board because of allegations of mismanagement and had the schools president report directly to Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran. One of the new virtual school chiefs hired this summer is a former Republican lawmaker from Orange County who served in the Florida House when Corcoran was Speaker. Another worked at the DCF and listed Corcoran, who he knows from church, as a reference on the resume he sent to the virtual school. The two others helped run Republican campaigns in Florida or worked for Republican leaders in the state Capitol. All four were hired outside the online public schools traditional interviewing process, the schools hiring documents show. Floridas courts among nations worst for businesses, survey says19 via Wayne Garcia of WUSF The Harris Poll survey for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said Florida is the fifth-worst for having courtrooms unfriendly to businesses. The poll of more than 1,300 business owners and their attorneys found that the state ranks lowest for what they perceived to be partial trial judges, unfair juries and treatment of class-action lawsuits.

Davis, to establish a longleaf pine forest extending as far as the eye can see.

In Walton County, two deals are being considered that would add just under 2,600 acres to what is known as the Seven Runs Creek Final Phase Florida Forever project. The total price for the state to obtain the two parcels is approximately 2.7 million, according to the Cabinet agenda.

What House Republicans are reading GOPs Medicaid expansion compromise is back on the table22 via The News Observer Medicaid expansion is getting renewed attention after state House Republicans surprised Democrats with a budget vote while most of them were absent. An expansion bill was added to the House floor calendar at the same time as the budget override veto. The issues were tied together Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed the budget primarily because it did not expand Medicaid as the Obama-era Affordable Care Act allows and as 36 states Florida not among them and the District of Columbia have decided to do. What Ken Lawson is reading Audit Maryland Commerce Department failed to verify that companies receiving incentives created jobs23 via The Baltimore Sun The Maryland Department of Commerce oversees a range of taxpayer-funded incentives meant to help spur job creation in the private sector. But the agency has failed to verify that companies receiving incentives actually created the promised jobs, according to a new audit. In many cases, the department relied on information provided by the companies or on infrequent reviews by its internal audits office steps that were insufficient to ensure compliance with program regulations, state auditors found. D.C. MATTERS Let Florida snowbirds from Canada stay longer, Marco Rubio and Rick Scott urge24 via the News Service of Florida The Florida Republicans announced they introduced legislation dubbed the Canadian Snowbirds Act, which seeks to allow Canadian citizens over age 50 who own or rent U.S. homes to spend up to eight months a year in the country. Currently, the annual U.S. stay is capped at six months. The Senators pointed to the impact of Canadians on Floridas economy. Tourism is a crucial part of Floridas booming economy, creating and supporting thousands of jobs all across the Sunshine State, Rubio said in a prepared statement. This bill will be a huge boost to our states economy by allowing the millions of Canadian snowbirds who visit Florida each year to stay two months longer. Marco Rubio and Rick Scott want snowbirds to stay in Florida just a little longer. VA office eviction of Congress members shows nothing is safe from political warfare25 via the Orlando Sentinel Editorial Board Good luck trying to make sense of the political squabble between Florida representatives and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs over an office space. Staffs for U.S. Reps. Stephanie Murphy and Darren Soto, both Democrats, were given free, part-time office space at the Orlando VA Medical Center at Lake Nona. Meeting with their veteran constituents at the hospital created a convenient, one-stop service for people needing help with things like accessing their health benefits. Four additional U.S. representatives including Republican Brian Mast have a similar arrangement with the West Palm BeachVA Medical Center. But the VA gave them all a bipartisan boot. Their arrangement was legal, logical and purposeful. Now, its also defunct. 2020 Legalizing marijuana, with a focus on social justice, unites 2020 Democrats26 via Trip Gabriel of The New York Times The issue today is a pillar of progressive politics, but not because of graying hippies who like their Rocky Mountain High. Rather, for many Democrats, legalization has become a litmus test for candidates commitment to equal treatment for all races in policing and criminal justice as well as fighting economic inequality. A Democrat who is not on board with legalization or addressing it in terms of repairing harms brought by prohibition for decades is going to have a tough time convincing any voter theyre serious about racial justice, said Vincent Southerland, executive director of the Center on Race, Inequality and the Law at New York University Law School.

Biden flexes 2020 muscle with new Black Caucus endorsements28 via Bill Barrow of The Associated Press Biden sought to demonstrate a broad appeal to Democrats on Thursday with new endorsements from leading African American lawmakers and a former governor of a pivotal swing state. The backing from Reps. G.K. Butterfield of North Carolina, Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri and Charlie Crist of Florida reflects Bidens play both for the party establishment and for minority voters who are critical in the early stages of the primary. Crist said Biden offers a moral alternative to Donald Trump and can best serve a fractured electorate. Ive known Joe Biden for a long time, Crist said, describing Biden as an empathetic figure with a keen intellect and a deep soul. Charlie Crist endorses Joe Biden for president29 via Steve Contorno of the Tampa Bay Times The St. Petersburg Democrat said Biden is the best candidate to help the party recruit independent and disaffected Republicans needed to win Florida and deny Trump a second term in office. Joe Bidens record of getting things done speaks for itself, Crist said in a statement. He has always put the American people above party lines and will continue to as President. Biden has won quite a bit of support from Floridas Democratic establishment, including former U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson and former U.S. Senator and Gov. Bob Graham. Cory Booker bags endorsement from DNC Member Nikki Barnes Booker earned support from Barnes in his bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. My cousin committed suicide by a gun when we were 16 years old, Barnes said in a statement announcing her endorsement. The fact that Cory is willing to remove the stigma in his administration and appoint someone who will normalize the conversation about suicide and put forth initiatives that could possibly aid someone else in seeking help means a lot to me. In May, Booker proposed a plan aimed at cutting down on gun suicides. That plan included pushing safe storage laws, appointing a federal coordinator to address the issue, and extreme risk laws to remove guns from individuals showing suicide risk factors. Kamala Harris bets it all on Iowa to break freefall30 via Christopher Cadelago of POLITICO Harris huddled with top campaign officials in Baltimore to discuss the next steps as a series of polls show her plummeting into the mid-single digits. Shes not expected to alter her message significantly. Instead, Harris is planning to make weekly visits to the state and nearly double the size of her 65-person ground operation. The re-engagement in Iowa where the California senator held a 17-stop bus tour in August but hasnt returned since is part of a broader acknowledgment inside the campaign that she hasnt been in the early states enough. Its designed to refocus her campaign and clarify her narrowing path to the nomination. Kamala Harris is betting big on Iowa to save her free-falling campaign. The surprising surge of Andrew Yang31 via Michael Kruse of POLITICO Its a phenomenon hard to figure until you get up close and take in some strange political alchemy. At the heart of Yangs appeal is a paradox. In delivering his alarming, existentially unsettling message of automation and artificial intelligence wreaking havoc on Americas economic, emotional and social well-being, he cracks jokes. He laughs easily, and those around him, and who come to see him, end up laughing a lot, too. Its not that Yangs doing stump-speech stand-up. Its more a certain nonchalant whimsy that leavens what he says and does. Hes attracting support from an unorthodox jumble of citizens, from a host of top technologists, but from penitent Trump voters, too. Sabatos Crystal Ball keeps Florida leaning Republican in latest 2020 prediction32 via Jacob Ogles of Florida Politics While Sunshine State pols gear up for a 2020 battle, one prognosticator maintains Florida wont be a swing state. Sabatos Crystal Ball, run by University of Virginias Larry Sabato, leaves Florida in the Leans R column. Thats not new the outfit colored Florida pink when it issues its first 2020 map in March. But after three statewide races in Florida went to recount, the Sabato ranking still stuns with its stubbornness. Interestingly, the map appears somewhat foreboding for Trump. The incumbent Republican counts 248 electoral votes on the map, including Floridas 29 votes. The map puts Democrats, who have yet to set a contentious nomination process, on equal footing. THE TRAIL Stan McClain endorses Joe Harding for HD 2233 via Drew Wilson of Florida Politics Republican Harding picked up another endorsement for his campaign to succeed term-limited Rep. Charlie Stone in House District 22. On Thursday, Hardings campaign got the nod from Republican Rep. McClain, who represents neighboring House District 23. I have no doubt in my mind that Joe Harding has what it takes to get things done in Tallahassee, McClain said in a news release. His roots in the district, his business experience, and his strong conservative values all make him perfectly suited to effectively serve the people of District 22. McClains endorsement comes a week after Levy County Tax Collector Linda Fugate lined up behind Harding. HD 22 covers all of Levy County as well as southwest Marion County.

Mayor Lenny Curry says Jacksonvilles Cure Violence zones went nearly a month with no shootings or homicides37 via Andrew Pantazi of the Florida Times-Union Even as Jacksonville grapples with the highest number of homicides in decades, Mayor Curry said the city has begun to see success in the two areas where it has implemented new anti-violence measures, with its two zones both experiencing nearly a month of no shootings or homicides. The city began implementing Cure Violence in June of this year with two zones set up. A Times-Union analysis from nearly 15 years of homicide data shows those areas have long led the city in homicides. Cure Violence is having a positive impact on violence in the target areas, Curry said. Both sites have had a stretch of at least 25 days in a row without a shooting or killing.

Pinellas school guardian pawned his gun and body armor, deputies say40 via Kathryn Varn and Brandon Meyer of the Tampa Bay Times A former Pinellas County school guardian is accused of pawning the Glock 17 9 mm semi-automatic pistol he was issued to protect students, according to the Sheriffs Office. Erick Russell, 37, also pawned the body armor and magazines he was issued, deputies said. Those allegations came to light after Russell was arrested Sept. 5 on charges of domestic battery and false imprisonment. That arrest led to his termination from the Pinellas County School District, spokeswoman Lisa Wolf-Chason said. During that investigation, deputies discovered Russell had pawned his sheriff-issued Glock and two magazines on three occasions during a one-month period from July 2 to Aug. 1. Russell admitted to pawning the items while being questioned Wednesday evening. Dunedin mayor faces questions over home conditions41 via Kylie McGivern of WFTS Tampa Bay In early August, the I-Team responded to a tip and found a tarp covering the roof of Mayor Julie Ward Bujalskis Dunedin home and a trailer in the driveway. Dunedins website lists the condition of structures and recreational equipment among the citys top code violations. The tip came as the city of Dunedin defends itself in a legal and public firestorm for fining a man 30,000 for high grass. I think the mayors situation really highlights how easy it is for basically anybody to run afoul of Dunedins very extensive code enforcement ordinances, Institute for Justice attorney Ari Bargil said. You could probably find something wrong with almost everybodys house in Dunedin. Thats how petty some of these violations are. Man spends 8 hours atop 400-foot WKMG-TV tower before climbing down42 via Daniel Dahm of Click Orlando Nearly eight hours after a 43-year-old man scaled a tower outside the WKMG-TV News 6 studios Wednesday, he descended from the 400-foot structure where Orlando police negotiators and first responders were waiting. He was transported to a hospital for a physical and mental evaluation, according to Orlando police. When the man climbed the tower Wednesday morning, authorities closed access in and out of the station as Orlando police crisis negotiators attempted to talk him down.

OPINIONS Legislators dont have a monopoly on wisdom49 via the South Florida Sun-Sentinel editorial board Again this year, there is legislation to abolish the Constitution Revision Commission. Politicians always claim to trust the people, but they dont mean it. This assault is cut from the same cloth as last years House Bill 5, which made it much harder and costlier for citizens to mount initiative campaigns. The initiative process is the only recourse available to people when lawmakers refuse to listen. But legislative leaders think they and the special interests who back them know best. They forget that same arrogance of power is what led to the creation of the revision commission and the initiative process in the first place.

ALOE How The West Wing was won Aaron Sorkin on the shows legacy56 via Joy Press of Vanity Fair The West Wings vision of liberal, populist President Jed Bartlet played by progressive mensch Martin Sheen and his staffers served as a fantasy bubble for battered Democrats.

The idea of a West Wing revival pops up from time to time. Will it happen, and what would it look like? Sure, I would love to do it.

The Sullivan Arena, which provided shelter for hundreds of people nightly for more than two years, closed Thursday. The use of Anchorages Centennial Campground as a place for people to stay is seen as a stopgap measure, with indoor shelters full and Mayor Dave Bronsons administration clearing illegal campsites, citing fire danger, the Anchorage Daily News reports. On Wednesday, the sound of an air horn blasted through the campground as a black bear and two cubs sauntered into the site. Individuals who were camping there and local health department workers tried to scare the bears off with the horn, shouts and claps. Jimmie Hartley said he planned to string cans filled with gravel on a fishing line around his site to warn him of approaching bears. Many of those who were arriving at the campground from Sullivan Arena had minimal gear. One major question is determining how many people the campground can safely accommodate, along with site rules, local Parks and Recreation Director Mike Braniff said. Right now, were not allowing any fires here, he said. Food safety and bear safety is at the top of our list.",homelessness

Sometimes I wanted to commit to people, or them to me, but in the past two years no such interests had fallen into alignment. I had started on this behaviour more or less by accident, still thinking that I would find someone I loved and begin a relationship. Now I sought out sex even when it would lead nowhere. I thought of it as an important way to connect with friends. I saw good sex and bad sex as equally valuable. But there were still some problems, I said. I still didnt feel as free as I wanted to. Sometimes I couldnt cross the barriers that keep people from expressing their desires. Rejection didnt hurt any less, although it didnt hurt more, and I knew better now how to work through it, mostly by having sex with other people.

With communities throughout Massachusetts and the country working to improve the quality of their drinking water, bracing for rising seas and more intense storms, and seeking to be more competitive in the global economy, this legislative package will provide welcome relief and support for critical infrastructure. I have long focused on providing resources needed to improve the maritime linchpin of my States economy Boston Harbor. But this economic engine needs direct Federal funding to fire on all cylinders, especially as we transition to a new, supersized shipping era. Two years ago, the Panama Canal completed an expansion project that allows bigger vessels, called post-Panamax ships, to pass through the canal. These ships, which are the length of aircraft carriers and can carry more than three times as much cargo as their competitors, are too large to dock at Boston Harbor today. That is why, in the 2014 Federal water resources bill, I fought to authorize 216 million in Federal funding for the Boston Harbor improvement project, which will deepen the harbor to accommodate those post-Panamax ships. I am pleased that my provision dedicating an additional 16 million to this crucial project was included in the 2016 water resources bill. The Boston Harbor improvement project is projected to double the harbors container volume, protect and grow 7,000 jobs, and generate 4.6 billion in economic activity throughout the New England region. It is a simple formula Larger ships mean more cargo, more cargo means more commerce, and more commerce means more jobs for Boston and the State of Massachusetts. I am pleased that the Corps has to date allocated 91 million of funding to this critical project thus far, but deepening the harbor alone does not ensure that the Port of Boston can accommodate these new, gargantuan giants of the seas. We must also deepen the berths, the area where the ships dock. That is why I am proud to secure a provision in this bill that will allow the port to construct more expansive berths, and I am pleased to help secure Page S6749 a 42 million Federal grant to expand these berths. By no means is Boston Harbor the only coastal gem in Massachusetts. In 2020, we will be celebrating the 400th anniversary of the voyage of the Mayflower and the settlement at Plymouth, but the celebration wont be complete if the ships cant get into and out of Plymouth Harbor. Regrettably, Plymouth Harbor has filled up with so much sand that ships are having trouble navigating--including the centerpiece of the celebration, the newly restored Mayflower II. That is why I secured a provision in this bill requiring the Corps to dredge this important landmark for the 400th anniversary. Just a few months ago, I helped secure 14.5 million needed to ensure that this hallmark of American history is swiftly deepened. With this statutory requirement and funding, Plymouth Harbor will be able to host a great birthday party in 2020--one that Americans from all corners of the country and people from around the world are going to attend. But those Bay Staters living on Cape Cod will most likely experience a little traffic on the way to the event because Cape Cod is only accessible by two bridges, which span the Cape Cod Canal. If Cape Cod is the arm of Massachusetts, then these two bridges are the vital arteries delivering the islands lifeblood. The strength of those two bridges will determine the strength of the islands economy and health and well-being. Regrettably, these two 80-year-old bridges, which are owned by the Army Corps, are structurally deficient. That is a problem for businesses that need an uninterrupted flow of commerce and residents who must have a safe means of evacuation in the event of an emergency. Imagine if there were an accident at the Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station or the equivalent of a Hurricane Maria. These two bridges are the only way for many Cape Cod residents to escape to safety. I am proud that this bill includes my provision directing the Corps to replace these critical evacuation routes, helping preserve the very safety of island residents. In a time of emergency, Massachusetts residents shouldnt have to think twice about the best way to get their families to safety. The bill also includes legislation that I have authored to help protect consumers from unjust and unreasonable increases in their electricity rates. Right now, if the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has a vacancy--as is currently the case--and deadlocks 2 to 2 on whether to improve a rate increase, the increase goes forward. To make matters worse, the public cant even challenge a decision in this circumstance. That is exactly what happened in New England in 2014, leading to a 2 billion increase for our regions consumers. My legislation would fix that by allowing the public to bring a challenge when FERC deadlocks, as they can for every other FERC decision. In sports, a tie isnt a loss, and the Fair RATES Act will ensure that a tie at FERC wont mean consumers lose with higher electricity rates. We must ensure that ratepayers are protected from unjust and unreasonable increases in energy prices. The legislation will help return the power to the people when it comes to energy prices by providing an outlet for consumers to challenge rate increases. I thank Senators Murkowski and Cantwell for working with me to move this legislation forward, and I thank my great partner in the House of Representatives, Congressman Kennedy, for his tireless work to address this issue and to protect consumers. I am pleased that this legislation contains several other key provisions that increase the funding caps for three coastal protection programs, allowing the towns of Salisbury, Newbury, and Sandwich to implement larger beach-nourishment projects--pumping sand onto the beach--to protect their communities reevaluate the Muddy River environmental restoration project to pave the way for reauthorizing this crucial project permit the town of Sandwich to use sand pumped from the Federal Cape Cod Canal that otherwise would be dumped in the ocean to fortify their town from rising seas ensure that the Corps takes on all the costs to repair the town of Sandwichs beaches, which experience severe erosion due to the jetties at the mouth of Cape Cod Canal and require the EPA to appoint liaisons to minority, Tribal, and low-income communities so these disenfranchised groups can have better access to the resources and tools provided by the Federal Government to improve the quality of our Nations drinking water. From fortifying our communities, to dealing with the present-day impacts of climate change, to eradicating the environmental contaminants of the 20th century from our water infrastructure, this legislation package will provide the funding and direction needed to help modernize the Commonwealths water infrastructure. I thank Chairman Barrasso and Ranking Member Carper for working with me on this important legislation. I was proud to vote in favor of Americas Water Infrastructure Act today. It is something that I think is going to work very successfully for the State of Massachusetts. It is something that, in my opinion, is the quintessential example of how bipartisanship should, in fact, animate the legislative process in this body. With that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. S.J Res. 63 Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, just a little bit ago, a few hours ago, we had a matter before the Senate relating to S.J Res. 63. This was a resolution of disapproval, which would have worked to disapprove of the rule that was issued jointly by the Treasury, Labor, and Health and Human Services regarding these short-term, limited duration insurance plans. I had hoped, actually, to have an opportunity to speak to this prior to the vote but was not able to. I want to take just a couple of minutes this afternoon to weigh in on this issue from an Alaskan perspective. I think there have been some suggestions that with this rule in place, those of us who care about protecting those with preexisting conditions, somehow or another, are taking these protections away. I have weighed this carefully. In fairness, I think some of the arguments that have been made are, perhaps, not quite as clear cut as would be suggested and, perhaps, certainly, in a State like mine, where we still have the highest healthcare costs in the country and some of the highest costs for coverage in the country. I think Members here in the Senate know full well that while I have opposed many aspects of the Affordable Care Act, I have supported and have strongly supported certain parts of it as well. Again, one of those things that I feel very strongly about is the need to ensure that we protect those who have preexisting conditions. That is a debate that, I think, is ongoing in other places as well. Yet I want to make clear that, certainly, my vote this morning is in no way meant to erode or undermine where I am coming from when it comes to preexisting conditions. Back to the situation that we face in Alaska, as I mentioned, we are the highest in terms of the cost of care and the highest in terms of the cost of coverage, and we are still one of those States that has but one insurer on the exchange in Alaska. So our options are, really, pretty limited. As I am speaking to individuals about what they are hoping for when it comes to coverage, they are looking for additional options, but they are looking for affordable options as well. It is true--it is absolutely true--that these short-term plans do not offer as much or, certainly, may not offer as much in the way of coverage as those plans that are offered on the individual exchanges. I understand that, but I have had to come down on this issue on the side of more choice for consumers and more options being a good thing for consumers. In Alaska, our population, as one knows, is relatively small. We have about 720,000 people in the whole State, but we are talking about 18,000 people, give or take, who are enrolled on the individual exchanges each year. The Page S6750 universe here is 18,000 people when we are talking about the exchanges. In the year 2016, which was the most recent year about which the IRS can give us information, there were about 15,000 people who chose to pay the individual mandate penalty rather than to buy the insurance. Think about what that means. They are weighing this, and they are saying I would rather pay a fine, pay that penalty. It is not that I dont want the insurance, but I cannot afford it. So you had 18,000 people on the individual exchanges, and 15,000 people chose to pay the individual mandate penalty rather than buy the insurance. That is because, if an Alaskan does not get the subsidy--and a pretty heavy subsidy--the exchange plans just arent affordable. Even though you want to have that coverage--you want that insurance--wanting it doesnt necessarily get it to you if you cannot afford it. The average premium for plan year 2018--this is according to CMS data--is 804 per month. What am I getting from constituents, from folks who are writing in to me and calling me? They are telling me what they are paying for their plans. For a family of four, the premium was over 2,000 a month, with a 7,500 deductible. Think about what that actually means for this family, for folks with those kinds of bills, who, basically, only have catastrophic coverage, as it is. Again, you think about the number of folks on the individual exchanges, and you think about those who choose not to pay the fines. You look at the numbers of those who receive the subsidies in the State of Alaska, which is quite considerable. We also have about 10,000 or so Alaskans--this is according to the State division of insurance--who have enrolled in healthcare sharing ministries. This is yet another option for people out there. A significant number has turned to these healthcare sharing ministries, and these folks have managed to avoid the penalty in prior years. In fairness, some of the ministry plans do not provide much in the way of coverage, but it is an indicator of what people feel they have to do in the face of just very, very high-cost plans. I understand where those who oppose this rule are coming from, and I have had good, long conversations about this. I guess I would ask that they turn to the realities that we are facing in a State like Alaska and just appreciate where people are coming from when you think about the 15,000 Alaskans who have chosen not to buy insurance over these past few years because it has been too expensive, but they want to have something they can afford. These short-term plans, while not ideal--I am not suggesting that they are--are an option for them to consider. What about the people who dont get subsidies and are paying over 50,000 per year before their insurance covers anything? That too is a situation in which they are looking for alternatives. So perhaps these short-term plans could be a viable option. For the 10,000-some-odd people who are currently using a sharing ministry, again, these types of plans could be an alternative. For the people who may choose to drop off the individual exchanges next year, these plans could be a path forward for some having some level of coverage. Again, I am not saying that this is perfect, and I am not saying that this is ideal. I am saying it offers a limited option in a place in which we have very few affordable options to turn to. Another reason these shorter term plans are helpful for us and why I have heard from so many Alaskans on this is that we are a State in which our employment base is very, very seasonal. You have a construction industry, but it is not like it is back here. Construction is, maybe, 6 months out of the year--longer in some parts of the State and shorter in other parts of the State. Yet you have a seasonal job. Our fishing industry is a great example. If you are working in the processing end of fishing, it may be 3 months. If you are working as a crabber, it may be 212 months. If you are working on a tender up in Bristol Bay, it may be a very truncated 2 months. Then we have the tourist season. Again, we would like to think that we can entice you all to come up year round, but quite honestly, it too is very, very seasonal. So we need to have some level of flexibility for those many, many Alaskans who move between many of these seasonal employment opportunities. Under the prior rule, a short-term insurance plan could only last for 3 months. That is not going to help out, say, those in the fishing or in the tourism industry or, again, in so many of these areas in which you need longer term coverage but you dont need a full year. So flexibility is something that people have been asking for as well. Where that sweet spot is, I am not sure. I am telling you that, for us, 3 months doesnt make it. Maybe 3 years is too long. Maybe we do need to look at that. I happen to think that we do, but that is an area that is open for review. The last point I would make is that I think we have to have some trust in both our States as regulators and in individuals, the consumers. The rule that we were speaking about this morning really does allow States to have a great deal of leeway in regulating at the local level. We are seeing that among many of the States. I had a long conversation with our director of insurance up in the State of Alaska. We talked about where our State might take this and looked again at, perhaps, the length of these short-term, limited duration plans and how they might be regulated. Also, there is the transparency side of this, and this is something that concerns me. Some of the things we have heard are that people have bought these less expensive plans, these shorter term plans, and then, when they need them the most, they realize the coverage doesnt take care of them. That is also not a place we want anyone to be. Making sure that there is a level of transparency, that there is a level of disclosure that is real and not just the tiny boilerplate that nobody can understand--it has to be, again, transparent in that way. I think this is one of those areas where trusting in our laboratories of democracy, which are our States, to tailor plans that fit a State well should not be an action that we here in the Senate are so unwilling to take. As we look to how we do more in this Congress and how we do more to help those for whom healthcare--the cost of healthcare and access to healthcare--is still their No. 1 issue, still the No. 1 subject of discussion, I have come to speak on this particular issue today because there are maybe 25,000 people in my State who could see some benefit from these types of plans being available and also because I believe that trusting the regulators, certainly in my State, to handle the plans intelligently is an important part of how we move forward as well. I wanted to put that on the record today following the discussion from earlier this morning and the vote at noon. Confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh Mr. President, I want to transition really quickly and just take a minute because last week, as we all know, was a very difficult time in the Senate as we processed the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh to serve on the U.S Supreme Court. That vote has concluded. Judge Kavanaugh is now Justice Kavanaugh, and I truly wish him all the best as he begins his new term on the highest Court in the land. But there is a residue--I dont know if it is a residue. I dont know how we make sure we are able to move forward after difficult votes that divide us all and work to come back together. I am going to speak very directly about my friend who sits right here next to me on the Senate floor. She and I went through, probably, a similar deliberative process. It was probably the same as everybody else here on the floor, but we perhaps shared more discussion about it than I did with other colleagues. At the end of the day, we came down on different sides, but both of us--both of us--agonized over the decision and the process. She is now enduring an active campaign against her. It is not just an active campaign against her, but there are protests at her home every weekend, and she cannot travel without a police escort. I made comments as I prepared for the final vote last week. I said We are better than this. We have to set the example here. I am really touched that after I had taken a hard vote within my caucus, Page S6751 there are some who are notably angry at me. But we are working together on the next issue of the day, and we are moving forward. We need to set that example in this body because if we dont set it here, I dont know how we can expect anyone on the outside to follow us. There is a need for civility. It is a hard time for us, but I would urge us all to choose our words carefully. Dont be afraid to speak with kindness toward one another. Dont be afraid to call out the good in somebody else, even though you have voted against them. We are better than what we are seeing right now. I am smiling only because I feel I should recommend that my colleagues watch a movie, a documentary. I dont do that often, but after the vote on Saturday, I just, by chance, picked up a DVD that had been sent to me. It is a documentary about the life and career of Fred Rogers--Mister Rogers--Wont You Be My Neighbor? I figured I needed something kind of calming for the night. It is OK to be good to one another. It is OK to accept people for who they are. It is OK to just find the good. With that, Mr. President, I thank you for allowing me to speak a little bit from the heart. I would ask us to be civil with one another now, not civil when the next election comes. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr. Toomey. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will oppose the pending nomination of Jeffrey Clark to be the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Justice Departments Environment and Natural Resources Division. This is the division that leads the Department of Justices enforcement of environmental laws and regulations. Mr. Clark is not the right person for that job. In 2014, he said the science of climate change is contestable. He represented British Petroleum in litigation over the Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill. He has represented the Chamber of Commerce and other industry groups in challenging EPA greenhouse gas regulations. He is a favorite of the Federalist Society, having chaired that groups environmental law and practice group. But his nomination is strongly opposed by groups that care about protecting the environment. The Sierra Club called him an outspoken opponent of environmental and public health protection. The Natural Resources Defense Council described him as an enemy of the environment. He is exactly the wrong person to be in this job of enforcing regulations to protect our environment. Just during these last few days, the United Nations put out an alert to all of the members around the world. We are going to pay dearly for this current administrations decision to remove ourselves from the Paris Agreement, where literally every country on Earth agreed to try to do something to clean up the mess of our environment and leave our children a better place to live. We decided, under President Trump, to be the only Nation to step away from it. Why? What in the world were we thinking? Can you believe that things that are happening that are easily documented can be ignored? Do you see the flooding that is going on now in Florida on a regular basis? That is just 1 of 1,000 different examples. If we dont accept responsibility in our generation to make this a better world, shame on us. We want to leave our kids a better world, but for goodness sake, do we have the political courage to do it? Will we be able to say to the President You are just wrong. We have to work together with nations around the world. The United States should be a leader, not an apologist. The President said he wants to make America first. How about America first when it comes to cleaning up the environment? There is nothing wrong with that leadership. It is something we should be proud of. This man, Jeffrey Clark, who is aspiring to be the Assistant Attorney General, just doesnt buy into what I just said, and I cant support him as a result. S. 3021 Mr. President, the 2018 WRDA bill--the Water Resources Development Act--that we are considering on the floor this week is an important step in modernizing our Nations water infrastructure and ensuring access to clean drinking water. It goes back to my earlier comment. If we are talking about the environment, one of the first things people say is, I want safe drinking water for myself and my family. Next to that, I want to be able to breathe in air that is not going to make me sick or hurt any member of my family. Our Nations infrastructure is aging and in need of significant investment. Last year, the American Society of Civil Engineers gave our Nations levees, inland waterways, and drinking water infrastructure a D rating in terms of its infrastructure report card. They estimate that 80 billion is needed over the next decade to improve our Nations levees--80 billion. They also estimate that 4.9 billion is needed over the next 2 years to maintain our inland waterways--4.9 billion-- and 1 trillion is needed over the next 25 years to expand our drinking water infrastructure. These are massive numbers, and they are going to require sustained and significant Federal investment if we are ever going to reach these goals. This bill--the WRDA bill--is a step in the right direction. It authorizes 6.1 billion in funding for the Army Corps flood control, navigation, and ecosystem restoration projects around the country. These are critical projects in every State. I just went down a few weeks ago with Senator McConnell to the Ohio River. The Olmsted Locks and Dam that has been under construction for decades is finally completed. It is an amazing investment. It is the most expensive civil infrastructure project in our Nations history, and it is an indication of the kind of investment that is necessary if we are going to try to tame rivers like the Ohio River. There are critical projects like that in every State. They improve our inland waterways to help deliver 600 million in goods and 60 percent of our grain imports each year. If we want the United States to literally lead the world--if we want America first--for goodness sake, we need to be first in investing in our infrastructure. These projects maintain levees and build reservoirs that protect millions of people and an estimated 1.3 trillion in property, and they protect the environment, they restore wetlands, and they prevent the spread of invasive species. I am especially proud that this bill includes an important cost share change for the future operations and maintenance costs at the Brandon Road Lock and Dam in my State of Illinois. I worked with Senator Tammy Duckworth on this project. The Brandon Road project is integral to ensuring that invasive Asian carp never spread to the Great Lakes. Knock on wood. We have held up that carp from going into the Great Lakes and, in doing so, we have preserved an important part of the fisheries and the lake itself. I want to continue those efforts, if not redouble them. While I am proud to support passage of this authorizing bill, I also implore my colleagues to remember that unless we are willing to work together--Republicans and Democrats--to provide these authorized projects with consistent and increased appropriations each year, then we are sending out press releases and not even getting the job half done. Let me say it another way It is not enough to go home and take credit for passing the WRDA bill, which is an authorization bill, if you arent also willing to pass an appropriations bill that actually provides the money to break ground on these projects. An authorization bill is just that It gives you permission to do a project, but then you need to go to the spending bill--the appropriations bill--to come up with the money to actually achieve it. Listen to this number. I want to make this part of the record as we debate water resources and infrastructure. An analysis by the Roll Call newspaper from earlier this year found that while Congress has authorized more than 25 billion toward Army Corps projects in the last decade--25 billion in the last decade--Congress has Page S6752 only appropriated 689 million. So 25 billion authorized, 689 million appropriated. What percentage of money have we actually come up with to finish these projects? We have come up with only 689 million out of 25 billion--2.7 percent. We send out all of these press releases congratulating ourselves about projects that are never going to happen. We send out the releases and say This is going to be great for future generations. We are not doing it. We are not investing in America. Slow and inconsistent Federal funding for these projects results in years of added delay and millions in added costs. Instead of funding new projects, we have to spend more on ongoing projects because Congress just doesnt get its act together--Democrats and Republicans. I am proud of the work of the Appropriations Committee on which I have been honored to serve. Both sides of the aisle do work to get their job done in record time and ensure the Corps has stable funding for the next fiscal year, but this years appropriations process should not be unusual. Unless we as a Congress commit every year to getting our budget work done and appropriating these Federal dollars, we will never get ahead on investing in our infrastructure. Our competitors like China and others around the world are making massive investments in infrastructure not just in their own country but in other countries that are teaming up with them, with an economic vision for the future. What is our goal? What are we trying to achieve right here in the United States, and how are we working to build our economy and create good-paying jobs for the future? Our Nations water infrastructure is in need of significant investment. The good bill we are considering today is just a step in the right direction, but an authorization bill without appropriation is just an empty press release. I hope we can work together to ensure funding gets appropriated each year to actually complete these important projects. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr. Gardner. Without objection, it is so ordered. Remembering Joseph D. Tydings Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I regret to inform our colleagues of the death of Joe Tydings, who died on Monday, succumbing to cancer at the age of 90. Senator Tydings was one of the most outspoken progressive Democrats in this body. He was born to privilege. His father was a Democratic Senator from the State of Maryland--a conservative Democratic Senator. His grandfather was one of our first Ambassadors to the Soviet Union. His paternal grandfather married Marjorie Merriweather Post, who built Mar- a-Lago, which most of us know is in Palm Beach. He came from a family of great privilege. Yet he was known in Maryland as a person of the people, representing the people of our State. His first elected office was president of the Young Democrats of Maryland. From there, he became a member of the Maryland House of Delegates, where he fought the establishment, took on the network in Annapolis, and investigated the savings and loan situation in our State. He really shined a lot of light on what was happening in abuses in that industry. He was chosen by then-Senator Kennedy to head up his campaign for President. Joe Tydings handled his campaign in Maryland for President and helped in other primaries around the Nation, leading to President Kennedys election as President of the United States. President Kennedy asked him to serve as the U.S attorney for Maryland, and Senator Tydings served as the U.S attorney. He was known for his independence at the U.S Attorneys Office. He pursued white collar crime and political corruption. He indicted and convicted a former Member of the House of Representatives, as well as the speaker of the Maryland House of Delegates. He recruited young talent to his office in the U.S Attorneys Office, including Ben Civiletti, who went on to become the Attorney General of the United States, and Stephen Sachs, who continued to become the attorney general for the State of Maryland. In 1964 he ran and was elected to the U.S Senate. He worked on progressive causes, including the Voting Rights Act, which he helped to get enacted under President Johnson, and also gun safety legislation. After leaving the Senate after one term, he continued to be extremely active in our community. He was best known, I believe, for his work at the University of Maryland. He served three terms on the board of regents of the University of Maryland system, giving back to the school where he graduated from both undergraduate and law school, and he was known as one of the most aggressive people in the reform of our University of Maryland System and also in the independence of the university hospital. On a personal note, let me tell you that he helped with my election to the U.S Senate 12 years ago and gave me a great deal of support and friendship and was an adviser and role model for me. I remember his being here when I took the oath of office as a Senator, walking me down the aisle. I had a great deal of pride that he was with me. He is going to be missed by all of us--just an incredible person, a person who put his principles over practical politics. It may have cost him an election, but he did what he thought was right. I can tell you that we are all proud of his service to the people of Maryland and our Nation. Mr. President, we will miss this man, who was determined to help bend the arc of the moral universe toward justice as fast as possible. Joe Tydings was born as Joseph Davies Cheesborough in Asheville, NC, on May 4, 1928, to Eleanor Davies of Watertown, WI, and Tom Cheesborough of Asheville. Tydings sister, Eleanor Cheesborough, was born in 1932. In 1935, his parents divorced, and his mother married Millard Tydings, who was then serving his second of four terms as one of Marylands U.S Senators. Several years later, Millard Tydings formally adopted Joe and his sister, Eleanor. Joe Tydings illustrious family included his namesake grandfather, Joseph Davies, an early adviser to Woodrow Wilson, who later was appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt as Americas second Ambassador to the Soviet Union. While Joe was still a boy, his maternal grandfather married one of the richest women in America, Marjorie Merriweather Post, who owned homes in New York City and Long Island, the Hillwood Estate here in Washington, DC, the Topridge Great Camp in the Adirondacks, and built Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach. Joe sailed home from Europe aboard the Sea Cloud, Posts luxurious 322-foot, four- masted barque, the largest privately owned sea-going yacht in the world at the time. Joe Tydings attended public schools in Aberdeen, MD, before entering the McDonough School in Baltimore County as a military cadet in 1938. After he graduated, he enlisted in the U.S Army in 1946 and served in one of the Armys last horse platoons as part of the postwar occupation of Germany. When he returned to the United States in 1948, he entered the University of Maryland, where he played lacrosse and football and was student body president and then earned his law degree at the University of Maryland Law School in 1953. Joe Tydings was surrounded by tremendous wealth and prestige and political power while he was growing up. The obituary that appeared in the Baltimore Sun notes that, despite the fact that Joe was born into a life of privilege, he was a frugal person and quotes his daughter, Mary Tydings, as saying, He was a man of the people despite how he grew up. His adoptive father was also a Democrat but opposed some of the New Deal legislation because he was a fiscal conservative. Joe, on the other hand, was a progressive from the get-go and attributed his Wisconsin-born mother as the influence, but it is clear that his father, who was known for taking principled, if often controversial, stands on many issues, also shaped Joes approach to politics and to life. Page S6753 As I said earlier, Joe Tydings started his political career by serving as president of the Maryland Young Democrats. While he was president, he confronted a hotel owner in Ocean City who refused to let Black members of the organization stay at the hotel for an event being held there. In 1954, Joe was elected to represent Harford County in the Maryland House of Delegates. Once there, it was clear that he was willing to fight established powers. He started with the States savings and loan, SampL, associations following a banking scandal. In My Life in Progressive Politics Against the Grain, an autobiography cowritten by former Baltimore Sun reporter John W. Frece published earlier this year, Joe reflected, I was appalled no one was doing anything about it. The reason, he argued, was that many too many Maryland politicians were profiting from the schemes that led to the scandal. While Joe Tydings had a famous last name in Maryland political circles, it was his early and enthusiastic association with Senator John F. Kennedy that pushed Joe onto the national stage. In 1960, Joe directed Kennedys Presidential campaign in Maryland and then helped out in other primaries, at the party convention in Los Angeles, and throughout the fall election. After Kennedy won, Tydings was offered a post in the new administration, and he asked to be appointed U.S attorney for Maryland. The Maryland Democratic Party establishment was wary of the young reformer nearly every Democratic Congressman in the State opposed his appointment. President Kennedy questioned his brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy about the opposition, saying how can I appoint him with all these people opposed to him. Robert Kennedy replied, Thats exactly why you are going to appoint him. As U.S attorney, Joe Tydings assembled a staff of neophyte trial attorneys that included a future Attorney General of the United States, Benjamin R. Civiletti, and a future Attorney General of Maryland, Stephen H. Sachs, and many other lawyers who would become judges and successful attorneys with prominent law firms. He worked hard to establish the nonpartisan reputation of the U.S attorneys office in Maryland and build a modern Federal prosecution force that has effectively targeted political corruption in Maryland up to the present day. Joe successfully prosecuted Representative Thomas Johnson, a fellow Democrat, for receiving illegal gratuities. He successfully prosecuted Maryland House Speaker A. Gordon Boone, another Democrat, for mail fraud connected with the SampL scandal. In 1963, President Kennedy visited Oakington, the Tydings 550-acre estate along the Chesapeake Bay in Harford County, to urge Joe to run for the Senate, which he agreed to do. On the November day that Tydings held his farewell luncheon with colleagues to prepare for his Senate run, he learned that President Kennedy had been assassinated in Dallas. Joe ran as a reformer and had to win a primary against the States beloved comptroller, Louis L. Goldstein. Joe, whose campaign slogan was Working for Maryland, Not the Machine, energized reformers within the State party, attracted an army of volunteers, and won. It was Louis Goldsteins only loss during six decades in public office. Joe then went on to defeat the incumbent Republican Senator, James Glenn Beall, Sr., in the general election. As a Senator, Joe Tydings backed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Fair Housing Act of 1968. He supported controversial decisions of the Warren Court, including the one-man, one-vote requirement for apportionment of State legislatures the prohibition of prayer in public schools and the guarantee of the rights of defendants to remain silent and to be represented by counsel. He was an early advocate for family planning and worried all his life about the detrimental health and environmental effects of worldwide overpopulation. He reached across the aisle to get things done, working with Republican colleagues such as then-Representative George H.W Bush. He regularly decried the lack of bipartisanship in the Congress today. Like many of his congressional peers, Joe Tydings came to office supporting American involvement in Vietnam, but as the war escalated, deaths mounted, and protests spread throughout the country, Tydings finally broke with President Lyndon B. Johnson and came out against the war. Although Joe was ranked 100th in seniority when he arrived in the Senate, he authored legislation to make long overdue improvements to the Federal court system, many of which are still in place today. He helped to create the system of Federal magistrates to lighten the workload of Federal judges improved jury selection so that Federal juries more fairly represent the make-up of their communities and worked to keep unfit, unqualified, or mentally or physically incapacitated judges off the bench. Joe became an enemy of President Richard M. Nixon by helping to defeat two of the Presidents Supreme Court nominees, Clement F. Haynsworth, Jr., and G. Harrold Carswell. Joe Tydings was an avid outdoorsman and hunter, but supported sensible gun safety laws, including the Firearms Registration and Licensing Act, which earned him the enmity of the gun lobby and the National Rifle Association. By the time he stood for reelection in 1970, Joe later admitted, he had probably supported one liberal position too many. The country had changed, and Joes progressive outlook had been supplanted by the backlash to new civil rights laws, fear over race riots in American cities, and a deep division over Vietnam. Vice President Spiro Agnew, who had been Governor of Maryland, called Joe a radical. Joe narrowly lost his reelection bid to John Glenn Beall, Jr., the son of the man he had defeated in 1964, 51 percent to 48 percent. I mentioned that Joe was an avid outdoorsman. He was also a great horseman. One of the many causes to which he dedicated his energies after he returned to private life was the protection of Tennessee Walking Horses from the inhumane practice of soring. He sought vigorous implementation of the Horse Protection Act of 1970, which he had authored while still in the Senate, and was honored by the U.S Humane Society for his efforts. After Joe left the Senate, he kept his hand in Maryland politics, supporting various reform candidates and pushing for legislation to protect his beloved Chesapeake Bay. He went on to serve as a member and later as chairman of the board of regents of his alma mater, the University of Maryland. He was appointed to three separate terms on the regents by three different Governors in three different decades. In 1977, Joe called for the board of regents of the University of Maryland to divest its endowment from companies doing business with the apartheid regime in South Africa. In September 2008, then-Maryland Governor Martin OMalley appointed Joe to the board of the University of Maryland Medical System. Joe Tydings was indefatigable. He built a national and international career in law, offering his legal services pro bono in cases challenging the death penalty. As the Baltimore Sun obituary noted, At an age when his peers were considering retirement, Sen. Tydings worked as an attorney with the Washington law firm Blank Rome LLP. He didnt need to be here for the last 20 years of his life, said Jim Kelly, chairman of Blank Romes Washington office. But Sen. Tydings chose to continue to work toward causes he deemed important. It sounds a little trite, but he really was committed to basic notions of justice and fairness, Kelly said. He was not afraid to wear that on his sleeve, and he was not afraid to stand up and be counted.  When I was sworn in as U.S Senator for the first time in the 110th Congress, I was honored to have Joe Tydings join Senators Paul Sarbanes and Barbara Mikulski and escort me to the well to take the oath of office. One of his political slogans was Joe Tydings doesnt duck the tough ones. So true. Joes life of service serves as an example to so many people, including me, particularly in these difficult times. Former Vice President Joe Biden wrote in the forward to My Life in Progressive Politics Against the Grain, In reading this memoir, you cant miss the salient parallels to challenges facing our nation today. The issues on which Joe staked his Senate career a half-century ago are the same ones that still require Page S6754 our advocacy and attention. Protecting voting rights. Safeguarding our environment. Pushing back against the forces of inequality that are hollowing out the middle class. Standing up for common-sense gun safety laws. In the Gospel of Luke, there is the saying, Every one to whom much is given, of him will much be required and of him to whom men commit much they will demand the more, Luke 1248. Joe Tydings was given much he gave back more. I know my Senate colleagues will want to join me in sending our condolences to Joe Tydings family his sister, Eleanor Tydings Russell of Monkton, MD his four children from his first marriage, Mary Tydings Smith of Easton, MD, Millard Tydings of Skillman, NJ, Emlen Tydings Gaudino of Palm Beach, Australia, and Eleanor Tydings Gollob of McLean, VA and Alexandra Tydings Luzzatto of Washington, DC, the daughter of his second marriage. He is also survived by nine grandchildren Benjamin Tydings Smith, Jill Campbell Gollob, Sam Tydings Gollob, Margaret Campbell Tydings, Jay Davies Gollob, William Davies Tydings, Ruby Anne Luzzatto, Emerson Almeida Luzzatto, and Maeve Chaim Luzzatto. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. S. 3021 Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to thank my colleagues for passing Americas Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 and to discuss the importance of it to the State of Washington. This legislation is going now to the Presidents desk, and it is very needed to help make our ports more competitive, to protect thousands of jobs, and to help protect our salmon habitat in the State of Washington. This legislation means the ports of Seattle and Tacoma will be able to deepen their harbors to allow them to meet the much larger cargo demands to compete with other ports on the west coast, specifically in Canada. This legislation also improves the critical habitat for salmon and waterways like the Puget Sound and the Columbia River, and it also helps utilities make commonsense investments for the future and helps to protect our ratepayers and the environment. I am proud to have worked on this legislation with our colleagues because we need to keep moving forward on investments that help make our region competitive. Our ports are essential to our economic growth in the Northwest. I always say ports are us because we have so many along the Columbia River and on the west coast, and trade is a cornerstone of our economy, with 95 billion in exports and 92 billion in imports each year. The fact that this legislation helps us on important maintenance and operations for both large and small ports and for locks, dams, and waterways is so important to our future. It also helps us with the important alliance that Seattle and Tacoma formed together to help our marine cargo operations at the ports, which generate 4.3 billion in economic activity and on which 48,000 jobs are dependent. What happened is that as the world market changed and large containerships could double in size the amount of products they were shipping, it was so important for our west coast ports to be competitive and to be able to serve these large ships. These megaships, which are twice the length of the space needle and wider than a football field, carry twice the number of containers compared to ships that typically call on west coast ports and need deeper waterways. To maintain a top-grade lane through the Pacific Northwest and to compete with the Canadian ports, the Ports of Seattle and Tacoma have to deepen their ports and make the navigational changes to address the large container ships. The Army Corps and the Northwest Seaport Alliance teamed up with the Seattle Harbor Navigational Improvement Project study, the Tacoma Harbor Navigational Improvement Project study, and many other partners to make sure we were making the right investments. In this legislation, the Ports of Seattle and Tacoma are big economic winners. They are economic winners because we are authorizing over 29 million to deepen the East and West Waterways in the Port of Seattle to 57 feet. When the project is completed, the Port of Seattle will be the deepest in the country. It will allow us to serve those megaships. Instead of having just 1,000 to 12,000 cargo containers, it will be 18,000 cargo containers or more. We are expecting to complete a feasibility study at the Port of Tacoma, which is currently at 51 feet. These two projects are going to help us continue to build the reputation of the Ports of Seattle and Tacoma, moving our products throughout the United States to Asia quickly and reliably and reaching critical markets. We dont want our shippers to have to pay more because we havent made these infrastructure investments. Moving freight is what we do. This bill is about making it in our waterways as well. Deepening the waterways in the Ports in Seattle and Tacoma will ensure they can compete with Canadian ports. It will help us to continue to grow our jobs in the maritime sector, and it will help us to continue to be a gateway from North America to Asia and around the world. This legislation also helps us in restoring waters adjacent to Puget Sound and helps us with our salmon recovery efforts. For the last 18 years, the Puget Sound Adjacent Waters Restoration Program has focused on protecting and restoring habitat within the Puget Sound Basin. Using this program, the Army Corps was able to work with places like the city of Burien to remove a seawall on the Seahurst Park shoreline. Now that shoreline is a habitat for endangered salmon and the home to bald eagles and osprey, and it is attracting visitors to the park. The Army Corps was also able to use the program to work with the Tulalip Tribe to restore critical habit along the Snohomish River. That was lost in the early 20th century. The estuary now provides access to spawning, rearing, and feeding areas for salmon. Puget Sound--the second largest estuary in the United States--is home to thousands of species that this bill will also help. Over a dozen of these species are listed as endangered or threatened, and our helping by making these improvements to clean up Puget Sound and restore habitat is so important to the viability of the Pacific Northwest. The bill increases funding for the Puget Sound Adjacent Waters Restoration Program from 40 million to 60 million and the per-project funding from 5 million to 10 million. These are just expanded numbers, but they mean everything to meet the goals of the projects around Puget Sound. We are returning to Puget Sound waterways that are unblocked and providing cleaner habitat for salmon--for threatened juvenile salmon--and opportunities in areas like Spencer Island in the Snohomish River estuary near Everett, WA. Another project will restore tidal flows and create open coastline inlets at the creek originating near Joint Base Lewis-McChord, in South Puget Sound. This will help us to restore spawning habitats for forage fish, support salmon recovery, and improve those shoreline conditions that are so important. These projects are an example of the diversity that our region uses when it helps our ecosystem, known as Puget Sound, and in helping salmon recovery. This legislation also helps in making sure those who make great improvements to water infrastructure, particularly our hydrosystems, get rewarded for doing that and ensures that they dont wait or hesitate to get that done. This legislation provides an early action provision for licensees on hydrosystems to make improvements and makes sure they will be recognized later. This provision would remove an impediment, and it encourages people to take corrective action sooner rather than later. That is good for our environment, and it is good for taxpayers and helps us save on energy. Most importantly, it does not take away any regulatory oversight from the agency but simply rewards people earlier for doing the right thing. Page S6755 I know that Chelan PUD is a good example of this and will take advantage of this as they plan to rehabilitate units at Rock Island hydro project--a significant investment of over 500 million. This area needs to have these upgrades, and this provision will help them get them done sooner. In this legislation, we are also helping with one of the most challenging things we see in our waterways, and that is protecting the physical infrastructure and waterways in our hydro system from invasive species. The highly invasive Quagga and Zebra mussels have invaded our waterways in 20 different States. If invasive mussel populations invade the Pacific Northwest, it is estimated that it could cost our region over 500 million in annual costs. That would be devoting way more of our resources just to manage that infestation. The Columbia Basin is the last major uninfected watershed in the United States, much of it to the credit of watercraft inspection stations on the Columbia River. The Columbia River inspection stations help inspect the boats that travel up and down the river for such invasive species, and an inspection of all watercrafts is required. I am pleased that this bill authorizes money specifically for the Columbia River inspection stations. This helps us because, as I said, with a river that hasnt seen these invasive species, the fact that we still do these inspections is critical. Last year, over 9,000 boats were inspected throughout Washington, and because of the funding for the Columbia River, these invasive species were kept out of our waters. That means they were kept out not just in Washington but in other parts of the Pacific Northwest as well. This legislation also continues the great downpayment on the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, which was created in 1997 and has helped our State--millions of dollars in annual grants. This is so important. As we saw with the many problems in Flint, MI, and other places, many of our colleagues know that this Drinking Water State Revolving Fund is necessary for us to keep clean water in the United States. These funds helped the city of Lynden replace its 1926 surface water treatment plant and ensured a reliable water supply to the Lynden community and surrounding area. The funds also helped the city of Prosser make improvements to its aging water system to ensure that communities have access to a clean water supply. At the end of this week, the city of Kelso will be celebrating the completion of the Minor Road Reservoir, which replaced two aging reservoirs that were leaking and that would have failed in the event of a natural disaster in the area. The city was able to complete the project with the help of the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, and I am so glad that is going to help secure more resources for that part of our State. This also provides States and communities with additional financial resources to make investments in their economies for the future, and it also helps to right wrongs from the past. I am pleased that the bill also delivers on an 80-year-old promise from the Army Corps to complete the Tribal Village Development Plan for four Tribes who were displaced when the dams of the Columbia River were constructed. The Yakama, Nez Perce, Umatilla, and Warm Springs Tribes all signed treaties with the Federal Government in the 1850s, and these treaties reserved the right of the Tribes to fish, hunt, and gather at all usual and accustomed fishing places. The Army Corps and treaty Tribes entered into agreements on fishing access. These sites were designed for day-to-day fishing, but out of need and the desire to be close to the Columbia River, they have turned into permanent housing. This has resulted in very challenging and unsafe living conditions along the river. I am so glad that my colleague Senator Murray and my colleagues from Oregon, Senator Merkley and Senator Wyden--that we have been able to make it crystal clear to the Army Corps of Engineers that we need to correct this problem. This bill ensures that those families will get what they were promised years ago. In closing, I want to thank our colleagues Senator Barrasso and Senator Carper, as well as the leadership of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, for all the hard work on this bipartisan legislation. When it comes to our waterways, infrastructure investment means jobs. It means the continued protection of clean water, and for us in the Northwest, it means helping us preserve our salmon populations. I am so happy that we have finally taken another step to strengthen the competitiveness of our ports in the Northwest. These are real jobs. In the future--near future--with this deepening, we will be able to serve larger cargo container ships, which will help us keep our competitiveness in moving product. While we move about 77 billion worth of products in Washington, we move much more than that from all States of the United States, moving through our ports. So while it sounds like an investment in two very large port infrastructures on the west coast, I guarantee you that it affects many Midwestern States and many products and the ability to cost-effectively ship to other parts of the world. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan. Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, before my friend from Washington State leaves, I want to thank her for her advocacy on water infrastructure, and I agree with her that this is a great bipartisan bill. The distinguished Senator from Washington State mentioned Flint, MI, and I just want to thank her one more time. No one stood stronger with me and Senator Peters in trying to help the people in Flint, and I greatly appreciate her help, support, and advocacy. Healthcare Mr. President, in addition to praising the water resources bill, which was a great bipartisan effort--there are some wonderful wins in there for Michigan--specifically at this moment, I want to speak about my deep regret that a little while ago, a very important resolution did not get the bipartisan votes necessary to pass on the Senate floor. That resolution, which failed, would have stopped the administrations short-term plan rule, which is gutting comprehensive healthcare and undermining people with preexisting conditions getting the healthcare they need and deserve. About half the families in Michigan have someone in their family with a preexisting condition. It could be anything from high blood pressure, to diabetes, to something like cancer or whatever other illness it might be. They are in a situation now, with these junk plans, as we call them, where they are going to be undermined, and they either wont be able to get any health insurance, or it will cost much, much more. I have often said that healthcare isnt political it is personal. It is not political. We all care about being able to get the healthcare we need for ourselves, our children, our moms, and our dads. When a family has a child born with a seizure disorder, they arent wondering whom their pediatrician voted for in the last election. When a single mom of two teenagers learns she has breast cancer, she is not concerned about who is up in the polls and who is down in the polls. When a senior is forced to make a decision between buying the medication that helps him breathe better or keeping his heat on, he is not interested in what is happening on Twitter. Healthcare isnt political--not to any person I represent or to me or my own family it is personal, and it affects every one of our families, whether we are Democrats, Republicans, urban, rural, red States, and blue States. I wish we could come together and work on ways to provide more healthcare and reduce costs based on that premise--that it is personal, not political. When people tell me their healthcare stories, I can assure you that they dont start with their political affiliation because it doesnt matter they simply want to know that the healthcare they depend on for themselves and their families will be there. That is why I am so concerned about the short-term, limited-duration insurance plans, which we are calling junk plans because that is what they are. They may be cheap, but they dont cover much, if anything, and you dont know until you get sick. Many of them are medically underwritten, meaning Page S6756 that insurance companies can charge whatever they like based on the applicants health, their gender, their age, their health status. Remember when being a woman was considered a preexisting condition? I certainly do. These plans are coming back. They are coming back through these junk plans. One recent study found that none of the plans cover maternity care. As a member of the Finance Committee, I led the fight to cover maternity care and birth control services and other preventive services for women. That is pretty basic for the women of this country. And if, as a man, you think you didnt need it, well, just ask your mom whether she did. On top of that, these plans can exclude people with preexisting conditions or impose yearly or lifetime caps on care. As I indicated, it is estimated that half of Michigan families include someone with a preexisting condition--everything from diabetes, to asthma, to arthritis, to cancer. Under the Affordable Care Act, we didnt have to worry about people with preexisting conditions being covered--until it began to be undermined through these new administrative rules put forward by the administration. Louisa is a beautiful little Michigan girl who was born with half a heart. I was so fortunate to meet her and her parents earlier this year. Louisa didnt ask for half a heart. She and her parents didnt do anything to cause it. Louisa didnt have a choice. She needs comprehensive health insurance. Unfortunately, that kind of insurance is getting less and less affordable. Thanks to short-term plans and other health insurance changes, comprehensive health insurance will cost over 12 percent more next year in Michigan than it would otherwise cost, and it is only getting worse. Louisa should be able to focus on starting school, growing up, learning to drive, going to college, and having a family of her own, not whether she will pay more for insurance, if she can get it, because she was born with a preexisting condition. Louisa isnt alone. She is just one of the estimated 130 million people in our country with preexisting conditions. That is 130 million people who could be hurt either directly or indirectly by these short- term junk plans. Perhaps you are incredibly lucky, and nobody in your family has a preexisting condition. These short-term policies are a good choice, then, right? Well, just ask Sam, who came to DC earlier this year to share his story. Sam is self-employed. He owns a small landscape design business. In 2016, Sam was shopping for health insurance. He had been healthy, aside from some back pain. He told his insurance broker that he had been to the chiropractor a number of times and that the chiropractor had taken x rays but had not been able to make a diagnosis for his back pain. The broker assured Sam that as long as he didnt have a diagnosis, he would be wasting his money if he bought anything other than a short-term insurance plan. Sam took her advice, thinking he was signing up for a quality health insurance plan that would meet his needs. Fast-forward to 2017 when at age 28 Sam was diagnosed with stage IV non-Hodgkins lymphoma. What he thought was simply back pain turned out to be an aggressive form of blood cancer. After 6 months of chemotherapy and radiation, Sams cancer was in remission however, his doctors told him that a bone marrow transplant was his only hope for a long-term cure. Then Sam heard from his insurance company. They refused to pay for any of his treatment--any of his treatment--even though he had insurance, including the bone marrow transplant, because they claimed the cancer was a preexisting condition even though his broker had told him that was not the case. Sam appealed this decision and endured nine additional rounds of chemotherapy to keep his cancer in remission. After months of waiting--months of waiting--his appeal was denied. Sam was left with no health insurance, no way to pay for a lifesaving bone marrow transplant and about 800,000 in medical bills, even though he had bought an insurance policy. Sam eventually was able to buy some real health insurance--the kind that covers you when you get sick--and get the bone marrow transplant he needed. He is healthy again, thank goodness, but his finances arent. In his words Instead of planning a life together with my girlfriend and a future for my business, I am kept up at night worrying about staying afloat, how to pay the next bill, how to avoid bankruptcy. This is the story of too many people before the Affordable Care Act passed, requiring comprehensive coverage and requiring people with preexisting conditions to be able to get affordable coverage. As I said before, healthcare isnt political it is personal. People with preexisting conditions deserve to know their insurance will be there when they need it. Families with a sick child deserve to focus on getting her better, not how they are going to pay the bill for the doctor, and small business owners like Sam deserve insurance that covers them while they are sick or hurt and doesnt leave them on the verge of bankruptcy. That is what we are talking about. These current plans undermine the capacity for people to be able to get real coverage. They are less expensive, but they dont cover much, if anything, and the problem is you dont know until you get sick. What we need and what everyone needs is the confidence that they are buying affordable insurance that will actually cover them and cover their families. Everyone deserves that kind of insurance. This isnt about politics it is about protecting what is most precious--our families and our health. Unfortunately, because of the administrations actions, we are seeing tremendous rollbacks that are putting more and more power back into the hands of insurance companies that are making their decisions based on what is best for their profits, not what is best for families. I am very disappointed that we werent able to stop that today, but I am going to continue to try, as are my Democratic colleagues. We are committed to doing everything we can to ensure that people in the greatest country in the world know they can have affordable healthcare coverage that actually covers their healthcare needs. Thank you. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan. Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, the topic of healthcare affordability should unite us as a common cause. We all need healthcare, whether young or old or male or female, rich or poor. Not one of us will go through life without experiencing a major health concern. Even if we have a clean bill of health today, we all face the prospect of accidents, illnesses, and the inherent universal health challenges of aging. The Affordable Care Act is not perfect, but it has moved us toward a shared goal of making healthcare more affordable for everyone. Most significantly, the Affordable Care Act prevents insurers from denying coverage or increasing premiums because of a preexisting condition. This critical protection has been widely and wildly popular, and rightly so. If you dont have a preexisting condition, you probably have a family member who does. The Affordable Care Act also requires plans to cover a full set of benefits that enrollees will realistically need over the course of their lives, and, overall, it encourages Americans to get their health insurance so that they will have the appropriate support when they need it the most. I will be the first to recognize that there is room for improvement in our healthcare law, but we need to be working together to fix it, not allowing the Trump administration to continue its relentless push to undermine the affordability of healthcare. Since the beginning of his administration, President Trump has taken every possible step to weaken consumer protections in health insurance, all the while misinforming the public about what the real impact will be on their daily lives. But Americans right now are feeling the impact. For too many hard-working families, health insurance and healthcare costs are still not affordable. Today, premiums are going up, healthcare prices are soaring, and the burden of cost is increasingly shifted to the patient. We should be focused on ways to strengthen our healthcare system so that it lowers out-of-pocket costs, removes barriers to healthcare, and Page S6757 incentivizes cost efficiency. But the flawed Trump administration policy the Senate voted on earlier today is a step in the wrong direction. It is a step toward terrible coverage for consumers who will not understand what their plan fails to cover until they need it. We are seeing yet another Trump administration effort to roll back parts of the Affordable Care Act that are actually working every day to help Americans. President Trump is creating a new loophole for some insurers to ignore the Affordable Care Acts central patient protections. This is moving us back toward a period where insurance companies could discriminate against Americans based on their conditions, such as diabetes, cancer, arthritis, and even pregnancy-- yes, even pregnancy. Millions of Michiganders rely on the Affordable Care Acts safeguards for preexisting condition coverage. Americans should have the power to choose their own healthcare, but unfortunately this administration has it backward. President Trump wants to give more power to insurers to not only choose who they cover but also what they cover. The Affordable Care Acts 10 essential healthcare benefits are truly just that they are indeed essential. The list includes things like prescription drugs, hospitalizations, and preventive care. Before the Affordable Care Act, we saw insurance companies neglect to cover services like maternity care, substance abuse disorder treatment, and mental health care. These are all truly essential elements of any true plan. The Trump administration is allowing for risky plans that make insurance companies money while shifting costs to taxpayers and Michiganders who choose to cover these essential health benefits. The Trump policy will create a parallel market that targets only relatively healthy, less costly individuals, and that is why I am deeply disappointed by todays vote and the actions of this administration. The true message President Trump is sending to the public is that he wants you to be misinformed. He wants you to make bad decisions and buy these flawed plans, increasing the profits of insurers. American taxpayers will be left with the bill when patients find out that their insurance and all of the money they have put into that insurance over so many years simply does not cover their healthcare needs when they need it the most. No matter where you live, how much money you make, or what your health record looks like, no one should be forced to make the impossible choice between seeking medical assistance or paying the bills for other basic necessities. Regardless of what the health condition is or when it arises, all Americans deserve certainty that their decision to go to a doctor will not push them into bankruptcy. Lets be clear that any Member who voted to support the Trump administrations efforts to undermine the ACA casts a vote today against coverage protections for preexisting conditions and against affordable, quality healthcare for all American families. Thank you. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada. Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Thank you, Mr. President. I rise today to share the story of one of my friends, Jesse Kleinedler. Jesse and her husband own and operate one of Renos most successful small businesses--the Under the Rose Brewing Company. They are also the proud parents of a beautiful baby boy. Jesse, her family, and their business are doing great. But when I met Jesse last year, she told me her path to this point in life had not been easy. In 2012, Jesse left her job at a large firm--and the health insurance it provided--to pursue her dream of starting a brewery with her husband Scott. About 1 year later, she learned that she was pregnant. During a routine checkup 9 weeks before her due date, Jesses midwife advised her to see an OBGYN. Jesse didnt feel sick, so she hesitated, but the midwife urged her to go see a specialist anyway. Midway through her visit, the OBGYN became concerned that Jesses life was in danger. He diagnosed her with preeclampsia and rushed her to the hospital. Jesses son was born a few hours later via emergency C-section. The doctors who delivered her baby agreed that had Jesse waited even 24 hours to see an OBGYN, both she and her son would have died. In no uncertain terms, Jesse told me that she and her son owe their lives to the Affordable Care Act. Without the affordable coverage having been purchased on the Silver State Health Insurance Exchange, Jesse would not have been able to have seen a specialist, and she and her husband, certainly, would not have been able to have afforded the 1 million in medical costs Jesses son incurred over the course of a months-long stay in the NICU. Jesses son is now a happy, thriving toddler, but he has a medical issue that interferes with his growth. Jesse and Scott, her husband, fear that President Trumps efforts to roll back protections for people with preexisting conditions will make it impossible for them to afford their sons health insurance. Donald Trump has not yet been able to get the support in Congress he needs in order to repeal protections for people with preexisting conditions, but he has taken steps to circumvent the wheel of Congress and hack away at these protections bit by bit. In August, he signed an Executive order to expand access to what are called junk plans. These are health insurance plans that dont cover essential services like prescription drugs, emergency room visits, or maternity care. These plans are designed for short-term use only and dont include protections for people with preexisting conditions. That means, if you sign up for one of these plans and are a cancer survivor or are a pregnant woman or are a war veteran, you could be charged a higher rate. It also means you could be forced to pay tens of thousands of dollars out of pocket for the care you receive in an emergency. Junk plans come in all shapes and sizes, but none of them comply with consumer protections established by the Affordable Care Act. The Kaiser Family Foundation looked at junk plans in 45 States and found that 43 percent did not include coverage for mental health services, that 71 percent did not cover outpatient prescription drugs, and that not a single one covered maternity care. Junk plans appear to be cheaper than comprehensive health insurance plans--that is, until you read the fine print. Junk plans have low monthly premiums and astronomical out-of-pocket costs. President Trumps Executive order allows insurance companies to trick consumers into signing up for these plans. Consumers think they are getting a good deal, only to find out, as soon as they get sick, that their medical bills are not covered. The American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network says junk plans pose a serious threat to cancer patients ability to access quality, affordable health coverage. It also says the present administrations rule will likely leave older and sicker Americans in the individual insurance marketplace, with few, if any, affordable health coverage choices and that patients who are living with serious conditions will be left paying more for the coverage they need if they can afford coverage at all. President Trumps Executive order to expand access to junk plans is not just an attack on our healthcare system, it is an attempt to send us back to the days when families like Jesses could not afford the healthcare they needed. Jesse told me she owes her life to the health insurance she purchased through the ACA. Where would Jesse and her family be without it? What if she had not been able to afford a comprehensive plan? What if she had purchased a junk plan instead? There are 1.2 million Nevadans who live with preexisting conditions. That is nearly one in two. That number includes nearly 159,000 children and nearly 270,000 people who are nearing retirement. The junk plans rule directly threatens their healthcare. Heather Korbulic, who is the executive director of the Silver State Health Insurance Exchange, summed up the risk junk plans pose. She said Junk plans are designed to basically take your preexisting condition and charge you more or tell you that you cant be on those plans at all. Page S6758 She continued If they find that youve not disclosed a preexisting medical condition . . . then youre left high and dry with no insurance. I dont want to go back to a world where Nevadans with preexisting conditions cant get the care they need or where insurance companies arent required to cover basic services like maternity care. I was a proud cosponsor of Senator Tammy Baldwins resolution to overturn President Trumps Executive order. In failing to pass this resolution, the U.S Senate has done a profound disservice to families and communities all across the country. I will continue fighting to restore protections against junk plans, and I encourage all of my colleagues to do the same. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota. Economy Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, 2 years ago, when Republicans took control of the White House as well as of Congress, we promised the American people that growing the economy was going to be our No. 1 priority, and we got right to work. Under the Obama administration, American workers and businesses faced a lot of obstacles, including burdensome regulations and an outdated Tax Code that acted as a drag on economic growth, so we immediately focused on removing burdensome regulations. Then we focused on developing a historic, comprehensive reform of our Tax Code, which was signed into law last December. Now, the Tax Code isnt necessarily the first thing people think of when they think of economic growth, but the Tax Code has a huge impact on our economy. It helps to determine how much money individuals and families have to spend and save. It helps to determine whether a small business can expand and hire. A small business owner who faces a huge tax bill is highly unlikely to be able to expand her business or hire a new employee. The Tax Code helps to determine whether large businesses hire, grow, and invest in the United States. A large business is going to find it pretty hard to create jobs or improve benefits for employees if it is struggling to stay competitive against foreign businesses that pay much less in taxes. A large business is also unlikely to keep jobs and investment in the United States if the Tax Code makes it vastly more expensive to hire American workers. Prior to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act last December, our Tax Code was not helping our economy or American families. It was doing just the opposite so we took action. We cut tax rates for American families, doubled the child tax credit, and nearly doubled the standard deduction. We lowered tax rates across the board for owners of small and medium-sized businesses, farms, and ranches. We lowered our Nations massive corporate tax rate, which, up until January 1, was the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world. We expanded business owners ability to recover the cost of investments they make in their businesses, which frees up cash that they can reinvest in their operations and their workers, and we brought the U.S international tax system into the 21st century so American businesses would not be operating at a competitive disadvantage next to their foreign counterparts. Now we are seeing the results. The economy is thriving. Our economy grew at a robust 4.2 percent in the second quarter of this year. The unemployment rate is at its lowest level since 1969--almost 50 years ago. Think about that. In other words, it has been almost 50 years since the last time unemployment was at this low level. More than 1.8 million jobs have been created since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law. Wages are growing at the best rate in years, and incomes are up 4.2 percent. Businesses are bringing money back into the United States, and business investment is up--from an average of 1.8 percent before the 2016 election to an average of 10 percent so far this year. Small business optimism is at historic levels. Consumer confidence is at an 18-year high. The list goes on. Those are a lot of stats, but they basically boil down to one thing that is, that life is getting better for American families. Incomes are growing, and families have access to more jobs and opportunities and better benefits. That means fewer families have to live paycheck to paycheck, that an unexpected car repair or doctor bill is less devastating, that it is easier to afford that family vacation or the fees for piano lessons, and that more families have money to save for their kids college or for their retirement. That was the goal--getting the economy thriving again so American families can thrive. I am proud to say, we are succeeding. I am proud that our policies are making life better for American families. Yet we are not stopping there. We are going to keep working to secure the gains we have made for the long term and make sure every American has access to a future of security and opportunity. Tribute to Chuck Grassley Mr. President, I want to take a brief moment to express my gratitude to the Judiciary Committee chairman, Senator Chuck Grassley, for his leadership over the past months as we worked to confirm Judge--now Justice--Kavanaugh. Every Supreme Court confirmation process is a somewhat arduous affair, but Chairman Grassley had to contend with more than an increased workload. He had to contend with Democratic colleagues who did everything they could to delay and disrupt the process and to taint Justice Kavanaughs confirmation. Yet no matter what tactics the Democrats resorted to, from interrupting the confirmation hearing to withholding critical information, Chairman Grassley stayed above the fray. He carried on with what needed to be done, whether that was compiling information from Justice Kavanaughs time in the White House or interviewing witnesses. He made sure the entire confirmation process was thorough and fair, and he ensured that Dr. Ford and Justice Kavanaugh were treated with dignity and respect. I am grateful we had him at the helm of the Judiciary Committee during this process, and I am grateful that, once again, he helped to put an outstandingly qualified Justice on the Supreme Court. Tribute to Nikki Haley Mr. President, I also want to take just a minute to recognize the outstanding work that Nikki Haley has done as the U.S Ambassador to the United Nations. Ambassador Haley has been a terrific ambassador and a real leader on the Presidents foreign policy team. She has been a clear, unequivocal voice for the principles our country values, and she has been a tough and outspoken critic of the tyrannical regimes that threaten our country and the free world. I am sure the President will choose an excellent replacement, but Nikki Haley will be a tough act to follow. I wish her all the best as she begins her next chapter. She will be missed. I yield the floor. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr. Lee. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my remarks, the Senator from New Hampshire, Senator Shaheen, be recognized. She will be picking up at the end of my remarks. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Climate Change Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, it is a real pleasure to be joined here today on the Senate floor by Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire. Senator Shaheen has been a tireless advocate for clean energy and is the Senates bipartisan champion on energy efficiency, alongside Senator Portman. The U.N Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a major warning last week. Ninety-one authors and editors from 40 countries reviewed more than 6,000 scientific papers to assess what it would take to hold global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. The report says that we will need to invest roughly five times what we do now in low- Page S6759 carbon energy and energy efficiency by 2050. The Shaheen-Portman energy efficiency legislation would help move us toward that target. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy says that the bill would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by about 650 million metric tons over a 15-year period. The cumulative net savings from the bill would reach nearly 100 billion. My State of Rhode Island is a national leader in promoting energy efficiency, so we know how good programs like the Shaheen-Portman reforms are for consumers, for businesses, and for the environment. Rhode Island has consistently ranked among the top States for energy efficiency. This year, we are in the top three on the State Energy Efficiency Scorecard. To keep global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the IPCC tells us we need renewables to grow to about half of the worlds energy mix by 2030 and to perhaps 80 percent of the worlds energy mix by midcentury. Coal in the global electricity mix needs to be mostly phased out by 2050. The fossil fuel industrys front groups, of which there is a considerable legion, tell us that this will raise costs on consumers, but renewables are now beating fossil fuel power on cost, and renewable costs are still falling. In a recent report on global energy trends, Deloitte notes Solar and wind power recently crossed a new threshold. . . . Already among the cheapest energy sources globally, solar and wind have much further to go. The Deloitte report shows the top solar States here in yellow, the top wind States here in blue, and these two--Texas and California--are in green because they are leaders in both wind and solar. If you look at the top 20 U.S solar and wind States, three-quarters of those States have electricity prices below the national average, so clearly renewables dont hurt energy costs. By the way, these States include some of the reddest politically, including Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, Iowa, and Texas. The cost transition with renewables coming down through the price of fossil fuel is showing up in U.S solar projects purchased-power agreements. You can see in this chart from Greentech Media that over time, solar generation costs have come down in line with new-built natural gas generation. That is what this band is. This is the price for new-built natural gas generation. This dot here represents a new project by NextEra Energy to sell power to the southern Arizona utility, Tucson Electric Power, from a 100-megawatt solar array with an accompanying 30-megawatt energy storage system for 45 per megawatt hour, right in line with new natural gas plants. One industry analyst suggested that this facility effectively took the place of a peak-demand gas plant. Defenders of old, dirty energy sources paint renewables as unreliable, as intermittent, but Deloittes report finds that renewables have actually proven to strengthen grid resilience and reliability. Integrating renewable capacity into the grid has gone well in practice, and FERC analyses predict increased renewable uses to improve grid security and resiliency. The grid operator in Iowa, the most heavily wind-powered State, figured out a while ago the algorithms to treat wind across its grid as baseload. When you pair wind or solar projects with battery storage, like that NextEra project, then individual renewable projects become baseload power sources. You dont have to aggregate and run algorithms that is a new baseload source. The transition involves batteries, and batteries are booming. Wood Mackenzie Power amp Renewables projects worldwide storage capacity currently around 6 gigawatt hours to grow tenfold, to at least 65 gigawatt hours by 2022 2022 is right around the corner--a tenfold growth. Costs are falling fast. Lithium-ion batteries are down in price 80 percent since 2010, just in these 7 years. That is an 80-percent drop in price. Regulators are adapting. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission just finalized a new rule--a unanimous and bipartisan new rule--for energy storage on Americas electric grids. One study has predicted the rule could spur 50 gigawatts of additional energy storage across the United States, enough to power roughly 35 million homes. Energy storage is actually coming to market already. The Colorado State Public Utility Commission just unanimously approved an Xcel Energy Program to build 2.5 billion in renewable energy and battery storage, to retire 660 megawatts of coal-fired power, shutting down ongoing plants for cheaper, new renewable battery combinations. The request for bids didnt just smoke out this one bid it brought out a flood of renewable energy proposals at costs that beat out existing coal and natural gas facilities. The IPCC warning was particularly serious and specific about the urgent choices before us, and we, too, need to be serious about a new direction to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change. Renewable energy and energy efficiency are our pathways in that direction, along with a new technology--trapping carbon emissions to use or store them, even pulling carbon dioxide straight from the air. These carbon-captured technologies have been starved without revenue because of a failure in energy market economics, which is that there is no revenue proposition for capturing carbon pollution. Which brings me to the Nobel Prize in economics just won by William D. Nordhaus of Yale University. Nordhaus aligns with the well-established market economics that polluters should pay for damage to the environment and to public health. That is econ 101. Without that, the price signal, which is at the heart of market economics, is off, and subsidies result. The market fails. And when the International Monetary Fund estimates the fossil fuel subsidy at 700 billion per year just in the United States, that is a massive market failure. Nordhaus recommends that we correct the enormous market failure which the fossil fuel industry now so busily protects politically. There is basically no alternative to a market solution, Nordhaus said in response to the Nobel Prize award. The incentives, he said, are market prices--to raise the price of goods and services that are carbon intensive and lower the ones that are less carbon intensive. The science on this, as I think most of us understand, is firmly established, and the economics are widely understood. It is the politics that keep getting in the way--the fossil fuel industry dark money politics. This is the last frontier of climate change, said Nordhaus. I think we understand the science, he said. I think we understand the economics of abatement, he said. He said We understand pretty much the damages. But we dont understand how to bring countries together. That is where the real frontier work is going on today. America should be leading at this frontier, not lagging. Lost in our fossil fuel politics, we are failing in leadership. History will not be kind with our failure. It is well past time for Congress to wake up. Mr. President, I yield the floor to my distinguished colleague from New Hampshire, saluting her once again for the leadership that I remarked on at the beginning of my remarks in working with Senator Portman to be the Senates bipartisan leader on energy efficiency. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire. Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague Senator Whitehouse, not just for those kind words but for all of the work he has done and continues to do. For the last 6 years, Senator Whitehouse has come to the floor of this Senate week after week, every week, to talk about climate change and to talk about its effects throughout the United States and around the globe and our need to take action to address this crisis. Thank you very much, Senator Whitehouse, for your leadership. Climate change is real, and it is a present threat to our planet. Senator Whitehouse talked about some of the science involved with that. It is very clear to anybody who has looked at the science who doesnt have a political agenda that this is real. It is a threat, and we need to address it. In New Hampshire, we are already seeing the impacts of climate change in so many ways. Rising temperatures Page S6760 are shortening our fall foliage season, they are disrupting our maple syrup production, and they are shortening our ski seasons and our snowmobiling. Ice-out occurs earlier each year on our lakes. They are causing sea level rise that can imperil businesses and homes along our seacoast. The strains on our fisheries and the increases of insect-borne diseases that endanger our wildlife can all be tied to the effects of climate change. I have here a photo that I think it is important for people to see. Moose have been one of New Hampshires iconic wildlife representatives, to put it, I guess, the easiest way. The moose are something that we are very proud of in New Hampshire. We have seen them in the wildest parts of our State, some even as far south as where I live in southern New Hampshire. What we are seeing as the result of climate change is a 40-percent reduction in the moose in New Hampshire. As I said, that is happening because of increases in insect-borne diseases. If we look very closely at this picture, it looks like there are little round balls on this moose. Those are ticks. Those are ticks that have been able to attach to the moose and, in so many cases, kill the moose. They are there because it is not getting cold enough in our winters to kill off those ticks, so they multiply in such numbers that they attach to the moose and they kill them. You can see this is a distressed moose that has been affected by those ticks. She shouldnt look like this, but it is the ticks. Those insect-borne diseases are also responsible for something called brain worm that affects moose as well. So for our hunters and the people who enjoy the outdoors and wildlife viewing, that is being threatened now because of climate change. The beautiful maples that produce maple syrup and that produce such beautiful colors in our fall foliage are being threatened because of climate change. The estimate is that in several decades, we will no longer see either moose or maple trees in New Hampshire because they will have been forced out because the warming temperatures will mean they can no longer survive. Climate change is also affecting the public health of New Hampshire citizens. Rising temperatures increase smog levels. They heighten the effects of allergy season. They increase the number of children with asthma. New Hampshire has one of the highest childhood asthma rates in the country, and that has gotten worse because of climate change. Scientists have proven without a doubt that CO2 and other greenhouse gases are the primary culprits for the climate changes that we are seeing and that human activity has increased the concentration of these greenhouse gases. If we are going to stop global warming, the United States must reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in every sector, starting with how we produce and consume energy. One of the things that I have learned since my days as Governor is that the easiest, fastest way to reduce our energy use is through energy efficiency. It is without a doubt Americas largest energy resource. It has contributed more to our Nations energy needs over the last 40 years than any other fuel source. Without the economy-wide improvements in energy efficiency that have occurred since 1973, it is estimated that todays economy would require 60 percent more energy than we are now consuming. In fact, savings from energy efficiency improvements over the last 40 years have reduced our national energy bill by an estimated 800 billion--with a b--all while growing and expanding our economy. Put another way, in the last 40 years, we have saved more energy through energy efficiency than we have produced through fossil fuels and nuclear power combined. So think about that. Think about the potential of energy efficiency in addressing our energy needs. Energy efficiency is also the largest sector within the U.S clean energy economy. It employs nearly 2.25 million Americans nationwide, and the majority of those people work in our small businesses. We know that small businesses create about two-thirds of the new jobs in this country. They are overwhelmingly responsible for innovation. Sixteen times more patents are produced by small businesses. So this is where innovation is going on, and it is going on in energy efficiency. Just to reiterate, energy efficiency measures have proven time and time again to be the easiest and most cost-effective way to address climate change, while reducing energy costs and creating private sector jobs. The thing that I like about energy efficiency is that you dont have to live in a certain part of the country and you dont have to be a proponent of other types of fuel sources to appreciate and to support energy efficiency. Everyone benefits from energy efficiency. Unfortunately, since he took office, President Trump and his administration have proposed policies that seek to undermine Americas clean energy economy and delay our progress toward addressing climate change. The administration has proposed rollbacks to clean car standards that will force Americans to pay more at the gas pump and harm our environment. Here is a chart that shows very clearly what rolling back CAFE standards--the vehicle emissions requirements--would do. By 2035, the rollback would add at least 158 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually. It would increase U.S fuel consumption by 13.9 billion gallons per year. This is according to the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. If we think about that in terms of fossil fuels--this fuel consumption--that is more fuel than we import from Iraq or Venezuela each year. Think about what that will mean for increased consumption. The administration has also proposed to replace the Clean Power Plan with regulations that would relax standards for powerplants at the expense and well-being of current and future generations. Appliance efficiency standards have been frozen in place. After four decades with energy efficiency as a bipartisan cornerstone of Federal energy policy, the President has once again proposed profound cuts to energy efficiency and to renewable energy programs at the Department of Energy. For those of us who support energy efficiency, there can be only one response to these rollbacks We must address them head-on, and we must redouble our efforts to keep America on the right track. As a result of bipartisan efforts in the House and Senate--as I said, energy efficiency is one thing that we can get behind, Republicans and Democrats--last month the President signed into law a spending bill that includes increased investments for clean energy programs at the Department of Energy--something that has enjoyed strong bipartisan support. In addition to increasing those investments, this appropriations bill marks the first time since 2009--so the first time since I have been in the Senate--that the Department of Energy will secure its funding before the start of a fiscal year. This financial certainty will strengthen these programs and the industries they support. The passage of the Energy and Water appropriations bill that we did today demonstrates that Congress remains committed to advancing commonsense, bipartisan policies that will strengthen our Nations energy efficiency. Just last week, this Senate adopted a bipartisan resolution that was sponsored by Senator Portman of Ohio and me, along with 19 of our colleagues, that recognizes the economic and environmental benefits that energy efficiency has contributed to this country. Senator Portman and I are also committed to advancing our legislation to spur energy efficiency innovation and other initiatives across the most energy- intensive sectors of our economy. Senator Whitehouse talked about the efforts that we have engaged in over the last 7 years. We have introduced our bill into Congress in each Congress over the past 7 years. Each time, we are getting a little more momentum in getting this through. We have gotten certain provisions of the bill through in the last two Congresses. It has been far too long since Congress passed a comprehensive energy bill, so it is time for us to work together to pass an energy bill that includes energy efficiency. This is bipartisan legislation. If it were brought to the floor today, I guarantee you it would pass overwhelmingly, and it would improve our Nations energy policies and help to grow the economy. Page S6761 We have some great examples of what is being done, and Senator Whitehouse talked about some of what is being done around the country to address energy efficiency and reduce our energy use. New Hampshire, like Rhode Island, is one of the States that are part of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. At the State, local, and grassroots levels, individuals, businesses, and governments are rising to the challenge by intensifying their efforts to advance energy efficiency and clean energy. This chart shows what has happened in the States that have been part of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. Carbon pollution has gone down 51 percent, and electricity prices are down 6.4 percent. For us in New England, where we have very high energy costs, that is very positive. So if you dont support energy efficiency for any other reason, you should support it because it reduces costs. Look at how much in energy savings to consumers 773 million. Since 2009, the nine States in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative have outperformed the national average in terms of all of these measures. Because the majority of proceeds are invested in energy efficiency, they have allowed electricity prices to fall, and they have saved consumers millions on their energy bills. As we look in the outyears, billions more are expected in savings, thanks to those investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy under the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. In August of 2017, RGGIs nine States agreed to strengthen their program by reducing greenhouse gas emissions at least 30 percent more by 2030. New Hampshire and other RGGI States have shown the Nation that States can make smart clean energy choices that benefit the environment while strengthening the economy. For those who say we need a market- driven approach to addressing climate change, this is a perfect example of that. Climate change represents an enormous challenge, but solutions are within reach if we put into place policies that will allow for swift action. We have a responsibility to help protect our children and grandchildren from the severe consequences of global warming. We have to start now, and we have to start with energy efficiency. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note that my allergies are a result of that climate change. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Tribute to Lisa Sauder Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, as the Presiding Officer knows, I have been coming down here nearly every week--usually Wednesday or Thursday--for the last 2 years to talk about somebody who is making a big difference in my State, the great State of Alaska. I call this person our Alaskan of the Week. Most of the people who visit Alaska do so in the summer--I was honored the Presiding Officer and his family came up to visit this summer--and we know that is understandable, to come up when the Sun is high in the sky, but this time of year is truly magnificent in my great State. To borrow a phrase that is no doubt familiar to many, including some of the pages Winter is coming. Winter is coming. Every day, the Sun comes up later and sets earlier. Snow is already on the ground in some places in Alaska. In some places in the State, the mountains are dusted--termination dust, we call it--and that dust is quickly turning into deep snow and making its way down the mountains. It will not be long before it spreads out all throughout our communities in Anchorage and other cities. The whole State is crackling with energy to get ready for the long winter, like we do every year. For some, though--particularly for the hungry and the homeless-- winter in Alaska can be incredibly difficult and incredibly challenging. Actually, as we all know here, for the hungry and the homeless any time of the year can be incredibly difficult and challenging. In Anchorage, there is a place where everyone, no matter who you are, is greeted with dignity, respect, and a hot meal. The place is called Beans Cafe, and the person who makes sure it all happens and comes together is Lisa Sauder, the executive director of Beans Cafe, and Lisa is our Alaskan of the Week. Let me tell you a little bit about Lisa. She was born in Anchorage and moved to the west coast with her parents when she was a young teenager. When she graduated from Pepperdine University with a degree in communications and political science, she was on her way back home to Alaska. Alaska always calls you when you leave it, she said. Its always the place that feels most like home. She worked at a local bank and the Anchorage Convention and Visitors Center, where she was able to travel all around the country to talk people into visiting our great State, particularly in the off seasons like fall, like now. Then her husbands job took them to the east coast, where they stayed for some time, but, once again, Alaska beckoned, and they returned. Shortly after coming back home again, Lisa saw an ad to help run Beans Cafe, and she knew she had to go for it. She knew that passion was in her heart. The fact that it is completely local and completely community supported was a huge lure to her, she said but so was helping and working with the homeless throughout the State. Lisas uncle, for example, was a Vietnam veteran with mental health challenges after serving in Vietnam. For decades, he lived on the streets in Seattle. She saw the pain that her uncles homelessness caused her mom and the rest of the family, and of course her uncle, but then he got help at a place like Beans Cafe, and she also saw the positive impact that not only had on her uncle but the entire family, the entire community. Beans is an Anchorage institution. It serves breakfast and lunch every day--about 950 meals a day--to the hungry and the homeless. This requires the work of about 120 volunteers a day. People from all across the community come to help out. On any given day, you will see a business executive, maybe a pastor, a construction worker, politicians--so many, from all walks of life--serving food to the homeless and hungry. We have also seen the recipients of that generosity of food volunteering themselves, all of them--such a supportive community--working together to help one another. Beans is so much more than a place for a meal. It serves as a mailing address for their clients. It is a place where you can call a loved one, a place to get some dry socks, a hat and a coat, warm clothing for the cold winter. You can get help with your VA benefits. You can get help finding a job or it is a place to get out from the cold for a few hours. Lisa said Oftentimes, the day that someone walks into Beans Cafe is the worst day of that persons life. And were there to greet them with compassion and respect. Lisa has also expanded the program to include a very popular program now in Anchorage called Childrens Lunchbox, which provides after- school and weekend meals for children. All told, between the meals served at Beans and for the Childrens Lunchbox, under Lisas guidance, leadership, and passion, more than 700,000 meals were served last year. Lisa loves her job. She loves how supportive the community is. She loves watching people grow and helping them get the help they need--and then their coming back to help others. She said Were all very fortunate here. We get to help people, which is a passion. Not everybody can say that. Lisas work extends far beyond Beans Cafe and the Childrens Lunchbox. She is also very involved in Alaskas recovery community-- recovery from addiction, particularly in the past few years. Anchorage, AK, like the rest of the community, isnt immune to what is happening all across the country with regard to the opioid and heroin crisis. The good news is, we are working in the Senate and in the House on this issue. We just passed a bill, a very important bill, that will help States and communities address this, but we have a long way to go. Too many young people--people of all ages--are being lost to us because of this horrible epidemic, and, unfortunately and very tragically, Lisas son Page S6762 Tucker, 23 years old, was one of those we lost. She has put the pain-- the deep pain of losing her son--to good work. She has turned into a fierce advocate for those suffering from addiction. She talks about Tucker often, wanting people to know that this can happen to anyone. That is why we need to continue to focus. Through her work and the work of so many advocates across the State, people are finally getting the help they need. Lisa said The peer mentorship that is going on right now is saving lives. So much progress has been made. There are so many people who have really helped to shine a light on the issue. Lisa is such a force for good in my State. She has tenacity, grit, courage, and a huge heart. She is doing so many things. For that, we want to thank Lisa for all she is doing. Congratulations on being our Alaskan of the Week. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. Healthcare Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, today in the Senate we were faced with two opportunities to side with cancer patients over insurance companies. In our country, almost everybody would say that we ought to side with the cancer patients over the insurance companies, but the Senate failed again in both cases. Let me explain. Today, as we considered this, we wanted to make clear whose side we are on. The side the Senate chose, and it looks like the Judiciary Committee chose, is not the side of patients. This morning, I testified at the Judiciary Committees hearing on the White Houses two nominees to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, Chad Readler and Eric Murphy. Both of these men have a troubling record of stripping Ohioans of their rights, and Mr. Readlers actions on healthcare are particularly threatening to millions of Americans--not just the 5 million Ohioans who have preexisting conditions but millions of Americans with preexisting conditions. Five million Ohioans under age 65, as I said, have preexisting conditions. That is half the population in my State. Because of the Affordable Care Act, these Ohioans can rest a little easier, knowing they cant be turned down for health coverage or have their rates skyrocket because their child has asthma or their husband has diabetes or their wife has been diagnosed with breast cancer. Mr. Readler is willing to take that peace of mind away and throw those families into financial chaos. This summer, he did what three career attorneys with the Department of Justice refused to do. He filed a brief challenging the law that protects Americans with preexisting conditions. The next day, the White House appointed him to a Federal circuit court judgeship. Filing this brief earned him rebukes from across the legal community. Three attorneys withdrew from the case, and one actually resigned in objection to the Department of Justices unprecedented action. Our Republican Senate colleague from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander, called the brief as far-fetched as any he has ever heard. Mr. Readler had no problem putting his name right at the top and filing it. We should not be putting on the bench for life anyone who puts partisanship ahead of cancer patients or ahead of people with diabetes or ahead of someone with high blood pressure or ahead of Americans healthcare. Unfortunately, the White House is also chipping away at the ability of Ohioans with preexisting conditions to get affordable coverage that actually covers their conditions. Again, we are talking about 5 million Ohioans, tens of millions of Americans. You can talk about anxiety and autism. You can talk about heart disease or heartburn, cholesterol, stroke, thyroid issues. We are talking about families. We are talking about neighbors. We are talking about some of the people in this body. Everyone here, by the way, takes care of themselves. We all have good health insurance. We dont mind, apparently, denying it to millions of others. Some Senators think it is fine to let insurance companies sell junk to our constituents back home. These insurance policies are just that They are junk. They are insurance until you need the insurance. Allowing insurance companies to sell these plans drives up healthcare for everyone. They weaken protection for anyone with a preexisting condition. Under their new rules, insurance companies could force Americans with preexisting conditions into these junk plans--and junk is the right word--that barely cover anything. They can charge exorbitant, unaffordable rates for a decent plan. Half of my colleagues--exactly half--voted for Senator Baldwins motion. Senator Baldwin, from Wisconsin, has been a hero on this. Half of my colleagues--all with health insurance paid for by taxpayers--have told the people Sorry, you are on your own. We are letting the insurance companies do whatever they want--rip you off, hike up your costs. That is the way it goes. It all comes down to whose side you are on. Chad Readler, the Presidents nomination for the Sixth Circuit, has made it clear He stands with insurance companies, not with cancer patients. The administration has made it clear They stand with insurance companies, not kids with asthma. Today, the Senate chose to stand with those insurance companies over their constituents who need prescription medicines. Honoring Journalists Mr. President, a free, independent press is critical to our democracy. Reporters do vital work, not just in Washington but around the country. They shine a light on the important issues in our communities. Right now, that means covering the addiction crisis that grips our country. Today alone--if today is an average day in Ohio, as I assume it is-- 11 people will die of an opioid overdose. Yesterday, 11 died. Tomorrow, 11 will die. Friday, 11 will die. We have been working bipartisanly to help get communities the resources they need. This month we passed a bipartisan package to fight opioid addiction. It is a start. We need more help from a generally disengaged White House. We need a State government to get out from under its corruption, day to day, that afflicts it and get out and do what they should be doing to fight opioid addiction. Everyone has a role to play. Local journalists do vital work keeping Ohioans informed of all the resources we have in our State. That is why, this week, I want to highlight another story in an Ohio paper informing the public, reported by a journalist serving his community. I remind my colleagues that the media are not the enemy of the people, as the White House likes to say, but they serve our communities. They live in our communities. They are part of our communities. They fight for our communities. Joshua Keeran reported for the Delaware Gazette about Maryhaven, a local addiction and mental health treatment center. Maryhaven is Central Ohios oldest and most comprehensive treatment center. It has been a great partner to my office in our work, along with Senator Portman, to help Ohioans fighting addiction. In my conversations with Maryhaven clients, it is clear what a difference this organization makes in so many lives in Central Ohio. Mr. Keeran reported on Maryhavens Families in Recovery Program, which provides education, training, and counseling support to families confronted with substance abuse problems. Through its reporting, the Delaware Gazette is raising awareness about this important local resource. This kind of reporting is what journalists do every day in every community in Utah, Rhode Island, Ohio, and across the country. That is why they are deserving of respect. We should reject the out-and-out attacks by the President of the United States and others who call journalism and journalists in the media enemies of the people. They serve their readers. They serve their viewers. They serve their communities. They deserve our respect. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island. Russian Hybrid Warfare Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I rise to continue my series of speeches on Russian hybrid warfare and the threat it poses to our national security. Russian hybrid warfare occurs Page S6763 below the level of direct military conflict, yet it is no less a threat to our national security and the integrity of our democracy and our society. We must reframe our thinking to understand that these are attacks from a foreign adversary on our democratic institutions, our free markets, and our open society. We recently honored our fallen and observed the attacks of September 11, 2001. The 911 Commission Report, which looked into what happened after the attacks, assessed that one of our governments failures in preventing those attacks was a failure of imagination. Now, too, we have the Director of National Intelligence telling us that the system is blinking red, akin to the threats we received before 911. We must be focused on the current problem as a national security threat. This threat requires that the United States defend itself against hybrid attacks with the same level of commitment and resolve as we would against a military attack against our country. For far too long, we have failed to recognize that hybrid attacks are the new Russian form of warfare. As laid out in the Russian National Security Strategy of 2015, the Kremlins approach to conflict includes weaponizing tools and resources from across government and society. The Russian strategy states Interrelated political, military, military- technical, diplomatic, economic, informational, and other measures are being developed and implemented in order to ensure strategic deterrence and the prevention of armed conflicts. The Russian strategy describes the conventional and nonconventional arenas of warfare as the Kremlin envisions it and how Russia has utilized all of the tools of statecraft to engage an adversary without, in many cases, firing a shot. These different disciplines make up a Russian hybrid approach to confrontation below the threshold of direct- armed conflict, a method that has been developing and escalating since the earliest days of Putins rise to power in Russia. The main tenets of the Kremlins hybrid operations are these information operations with cyber tools, which people commonly think of as hacking propaganda and disinformation manipulation of social media and malign influence, which can be deployed through political, legal, or financial channels. A further characteristic of Russian hybrid warfare is denial and deception used to obscure its involvement. The Kremlin deploys more than one hybrid warfare tactic simultaneously to provide maximum effect. A look at the Russian hybrid warfare doctrine also illuminates that the Kremlin sees deterrence and prevention differently than we do. This is a critical point. We see deterrence as a way to avoid conflict. They are not merely using these tactics as deterrence or strategic prevention in the way we think about these conflicts. Instead, they are deploying these tactics aggressively but below the threshold of where they assess we will respond with conventional weapons. One such example was the hybrid warfare operations the Kremlin deployed in Crimea, including covert forces sometimes referred to as little green men and the use of coercive political tactics, including an illegitimate referendum. Now, previously I have addressed aspects of Russias hybrid warfare operations against the United States dealing with tactics of financial malign influence and multiple hybrid tools they have deployed against our democratic elections. Today I will discuss another Russian tactic and its hybrid warfare arsenal the use of assassination, politically motivated violence, intimidation, or detention to pursue the Kremlins objectives. These tactics are sometimes referred to as dirty active measures. With dirty active measures, the immediate attack is deployed against an individual who is working counter to the Kremlins strategic goals by challenging Putins power base, exposing corruption, or unearthing hybrid warfare operations. But the damage of these hybrid warfare tactics goes well beyond the individual killed, hurt, threatened, or jailed by the Kremlin. These tactics cause chaos, fear, and instability to bystanders and have a deterrent effect, sending a chilling message to others that might seek to challenge the Kremlins rule. Further, the reach with which Putin has deployed these weapons inside Russia, across Ukraine, Europe, and even in the United States instills fear that if the Kremlin wants to get rid of you, there is nowhere to hide. Like all aspects of Russian hybrid warfare, dirty active measures are part of a pattern of behavior that serve Russias strategic interests. Putins highest strategic objective is preserving his grip on power. He also seeks to operate unconstrained domestically and in the near abroad. Finally, Putin seeks for Russia to be seen equal to the United States and to regain the great power status it lost at the end of the Cold War. He knows he cannot effectively compete with the United States in conventional ways and win. Instead, he seeks to use tools from his hybrid warfare arsenal in order to divide us from our allies and partners in the West and weaken our democratic societies from within. The Putin regime has been engaged in a pattern of dirty active measures for more than a decade, and the tempo has only increased since he retook the Presidency in 2012. These tactics have increasing implications for the United States and allied national security. I want to address this tactic of dirty active measures because it has taken on greater urgency due to recent events. In particular, I am thinking of the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, a former Russian military intelligence officer, and his daughter on British soil and Putins threat against Ambassador McFaul and other U.S Government officials at the Helsinki Summit. These events may seem unrelated, but they are actually part of a pattern of malicious and threatening Russian behavior. Today, I will explain the connection and make recommendations for how we can deter and counter Russias use of dirty active measures as part of its hybrid warfare operations below the level of military conflict. Dirty active measures have a long and sordid history in Russia and the Soviet Union, dating back to czarist times. For assassinations, poison was often the weapon of choice, including the attempted cyanide poisoning of Rasputin in 1916. In 1921, Lenin opened a poison laboratory to test methods to be used against political enemies named the special room, which was also known as the lab of death. At this lab, they developed the nerve agents known as novichoks, which were designed to be undetectable and were recently deployed against the Skirpals. These tactics were amplified under Stalin and featured killings by hired assassins, staged automobile accidents, and poisonings, used inside Russia and deployed abroad. Stalin notoriously said Death solves all problems. No man, no problem. Given President Putins background as a spy master, it should come as no surprise that Russias use of dirty active measures have continued under his regime. Before becoming Prime Minister and President, Putin spent the majority of his career in the KGB, the states security service, and its successor, the FSB. As Russian journalist Andrei Soldatov wrote, the KGBs main task was always to protect the interests of whoever currently resided in the Kremlin. In this system, loyalty and fidelity to the state is prized above all, and Putins values were shaped by it. In 2005, Putin lamented that the breakup of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical tragedy of the 20th century. When he assumed power, he resurrected a system that reflected Soviet methods. He employed all of the instruments of the state, including the Parliament, the courts, and security services, to protect his power base and to allow him to pursue strategic objectives in the foreign arena unconstrained. Putins use of hybrid warfare tactics of assassination, political violence, intimidation, and detention--the dirty active measures--are tenets of this system he created to cement his hold on power. Putin has also manipulated the Parliament and the court system to make and enforce laws that manufacture legal consent for tactics of dirty active measures. As opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza, who survived being Page S6764 twice poisoned, wrote recently in the Washington Post, in Vladimir Putins Russia, laws are often passed with specific people in mind, whether to reward or punish. Notably, in July of 2006, the Russian Parliament gave President Putin permission to use Russian armed forces and security services to perpetrate extrajudicial killings abroad on people that Moscow accused of extremism. Companion legislation passed about the same time expanded the definition of extremism to include libelous statements about Putins administration. This legislation effectively gave those who carry out dirty active measures immunity. In addition to the use of the legislative and legal mechanisms at their disposal, the Kremlin unleashes a barrage of propaganda against those targeted for dirty active measures. These information operations contribute to a climate of fear targeting both the individuals the Kremlin is trying to silence and the broader population. Propaganda campaigns are also deployed after the dirty active measure is carried out, in order to sow confusion and make people doubt whether Russia is culpable. Putin and his inner circle have drawn a distinct narrative, branding those who oppose the Kremlin as criminals, thus deeming them as deserving of punishment. They are often also accused of being part of the so-called fifth column, Russians that Putin defines as advancing foreign interests. Worse than criminals in Putins mind are those the Kremlin viewed as having been loyal in the past but who are now working against the interest of the state. These people are branded as traitors, and as the New York Times reported last month, traitors hold a special status for Putin. Putins disdain for traitors stems from the early days of the end of the Cold War, when dozens of former Soviet intelligence officers became defectors or informants for the West. According to the Times, Mr. Putin cannot speak of them without a lip curl of disgust. They are beasts and swine. Treachery, he told one interviewer, is the one thing he is incapable of forgiving. It could also, he said darkly, be bad for your health. Putin publicly threatened those considered traitors on multiple occasions. One of those episodes occurred in 2010. After a spy swap between Russia and the United States, which included the recently poisoned Skripal, Putin stated ominously A person gives his whole life for his homeland, and then some . . . blank comes along and betrays such people. How will he be able to look into the eyes of his children, the pig? Whatever they got in exchange for it, those thirty pieces of silver they were given, they will choke on them. Believe me. For Putin, labeling his political opponents in these stark terms helps to justify the dirty active measures deployed against these individuals. These tactics of dirty active measures have been used with impunity inside Russia to silence and intimidate Kremlin critics and preserve the system of power Putin created. They have been unleashed against journalists, opposition leaders, oligarchs, and others seen as betraying the system. A Senate Foreign Relations minority staff report from January detailed more than two dozen Kremlin critics who died under mysterious circumstances in Russia since Putin took power in 2000. The report separately compiled violent attacks and harassment on human rights activists and journalists. Russian opposition activists are also a target of dirty active measures inside Russia. One example was the assassination of Boris Nemtsov, a popular regional Governor and Deputy Prime Minister under Yeltsin, who became disenchanted with Putins political system. He publicly exposed extensive corruption and covert use of Russian hybrid warfare tactics in Ukraine. Arkady Ostrovsky, a Moscow correspondent for the Economist, described the tactics of intimidation deployed against him, including that he was stigmatized as a national traitor and an American stooge. He was demonized on television and on the streets banners with Nemtsovs face were hung on building facades framed by the words fifth column--aliens among us. These threats were followed with Nemtsov being brazenly assassinated steps from the Kremlin. Nemtsov appears to have been killed for exposing corruption in Putins inner circle and trying to serve as a constraint on his ability to conduct hybrid warfare operations in Ukraine. These acts were clearly seen as a threat to Putins power and his ability to act with impunity. Attacks of dirty active measures inside Russia continue unabated. This April, Russian journalist Maxim Borodin fell to his death after investigating the Wagner paramilitary forces linked to a close Putin ally and Russian troll farm patron, Yevgeny Prigozhin. Three additional Russian journalists who were investigating Prigozhin-sponsored, Kremlin-linked military activities, particularly in the Central African Republic, were killed under suspicious circumstances in August. Just a few weeks ago, the publisher of a website that exposes Kremlin abuses in the criminal justice system fell ill from apparent poisoning. This attack occurred on the same day he expected to receive the results of an investigation he commissioned into the deaths of the journalists in the Central African Republic. As I have detailed here, these attacks are not officially linked back to the Kremlin, allowing for plausible deniability, but are part of a clear pattern of tactics deployed against those who work to expose activities that may hurt Putins base of power. Putin has resorted to using dirty active measures beyond Russias borders, which demonstrates the willingness of the Kremlin to use these tactics not only for domestic political purposes but also as part of its hybrid warfare operations to advance Russias strategic interests against other countries. Similar to other tactics of hybrid warfare operations, Ukraine is usually where Russia deploys these tactics first, a testing ground for tools that may be deployed in the West at a later time. We see these tactics of dirty active measures deployed in Ukraine as far back as 2005, when the more Western-oriented Viktor Yushchencko was poisoned after he won the Presidency, beating Victor Yanukovych, the preferred pro-Russian candidate. The Kremlin continues to deploy dirty active measures, including assassination, in Ukraine with impunity. Last May, Denis Voronenkov, a former FSB colonel and a former Russian Parliament Member, was shot in the head on a crowded Kiev sidewalk in broad daylight. Voronenkov was once a close Putin ally who used his position to promote key Kremlin priorities, including, ironically, annexing Crimea. He fled to Ukraine in October of 2016 and began to criticize Putins government. He was slated to provide testimony to Ukrainian authorities that would expose Kremlin deliberations prior to hybrid warfare operations against Ukraine. Forebodingly, a few days before his murder, he told the Washington Post They say we are traitors in Russia. Again, the idea that he could be shot brazenly in broad daylight served as a warning to others who might want to expose hybrid warfare operations to think twice, and that they cant escape even if they leave Russia. Similar tactics were deployed against Montenegro as it considered and ultimately chose to join NATO in 2015 and 2016. The Kremlin saw the Montenegrin Governments decision to move closer to the West as a threat to its strategic interests, including Russias ability to operate in Eastern Europe unconstrained. When several other hybrid warfare operations, including propaganda and information operations, failed to keep Montenegro from joining the alliance, Russian military intelligence officers planned and attempted to execute an election day coup that included a plan to assassinate the Montenegrin Prime Minister. The attempt on the Prime Ministers life was unsuccessful, fortunately. However, it showed the extremes to which the Kremlin would go and the methods that were used to try to maintain its strategic interests. Beyond Ukraine and Montenegro, the Kremlin has increasingly demonstrated a willingness to use dirty active measures in the West, suggesting a sense that Russia feels it can operate with impunity even in these countries. One Western country where a pattern of Russian dirty active measures appears prominently is in the United Kingdom. Investigative reports have Page S6765 unearthed an estimated 16 suspicious deaths over the past 12 years, and that may not even be the totality. The most well-known measure of Russian dirty active measures inside the UK is Alexander Litvinenko, a former KGB and FSB officer who blew the whistle on corrupt practices of the FSB. While Litvinenko had retired from spying, he did consulting work with the British and Spanish intelligence services, helping both governments understand connections between the Russian mafia, senior political figures, and the FSB. Further, he continued to speak out against the Putin government and expose Kremlin corruption. Because of these actions, the Kremlin branded Litvinenko a traitor. He received threatening emails from a former colleague who told him to start writing a will. Litvinenko was later poisoned with polonium- 210. The poisoning also served as a deterrent to others. The day after Litvinenkos death, a member of the Russian Parliament stated The deserved punishment reached the traitor. I am sure his death will be a warning to all the traitors that Russian treason will not be forgiven. Litvinenkos poisoning served as a prologue for the poisoning of Sergei Skripal 12 years later. Skripal was a former Russian military intelligence officer who was convicted of being a double agent and sentenced to prison. As I mentioned earlier, he was traded as part of a spy swap in 2010. He was given asylum in the United Kingdom. Press reports indicate that, similar to Litvinenko, Skripal appeared to have been working with the Spanish, Czech, and Estonian intelligence services. This March, he and his daughter were poisoned by novichok sprayed on the door handle of his Salisbury, England, home. In conjunction with the assassination attempt, Kremlin officials deflected, denied, and deployed absurd propaganda and disinformation. They unleashed an estimated 2,800 bots to cast doubt on Prime Minister Mays assessment that Russia was responsible and to amplify divisions among the British people. They blamed the West for the poisoning and suggested it was a hoax. Once the UK named suspects and pointed a finger at Russian military intelligence, the two alleged perpetrators went on TV and absurdly claimed to be sports nutritionists with a yearning desire to visit a Salisbury cathedral. Again, these killings are part of a pattern. Both Litvinenko and Skripal were part of security services. They turned on the state and were deemed traitors. Even when they appeared to be safe, they were targeted for dirty active measures, sending the message that the Kremlin was the ultimate arbiter and that they could reach traitors anytime or anywhere. This message was also directed at others who might wish to expose Putins secrets in the future or try to constrain or challenge his power. The pattern of dirty active measures also extends to the United States. This includes Mikhail Lesin, a former Kremlin insider who was crucial to Putins consolidation of the Russian media. Lesin was also responsible for the rise of Russian TV and internet platform RT, a tool the Kremlin uses to deploy propaganda and disinformation across the world, including against the United States during the Presidential election in 2016. Lesin was reported to have had a falling out with two members of Putins inner circle, including a longtime friend known as Putins banker. Lesin was found dead in a Washington, DC, hotel room in November of 2015. The DC coroner concluded that the death was accidental and that he died alone, despite noting that Lesin had sustained blunt force injuries to his neck, torso, and upper and lower extremities. Lesin was allegedly planning to tell the secrets of a major component of the Kremlins hybrid warfare operations to the Justice Department when he appeared to have conveniently died before he could explain its inner workings. Similar to other dirty active measures campaigns, the Kremlin unleashed a disinformation campaign to ensure plausible deniability and generate confusion about the circumstances surrounding his death. Here, too, Lesin appears to fit the pattern of being targeted for revealing aspects of the hybrid warfare campaigns that the Kremlin has come to rely on. In what appears to have been an even more brazen move for Putin, he engaged in dirty active measures while the whole world was watching. While standing next to President Trump in Helsinki, President Putin proposed that he would allow Special Counsel Mueller to interview the 12 Russian military intelligence officers indicted on charges of large-scale cyber operations to interfere with the 2016 Presidential election. But there was a catch. Putin announced that in return, he would expect that Russian authorities would be able to question current and former U.S Government officials whom Putin described as having something to do with illegal actions on the territory of Russia. President Trump stood next to President Putin during this disinformation operation and endorsed it as being an incredible offer that he and his administration actually considered. The very next day, Russian officials announced a list of 11 accused criminals whom they wanted to interrogate because, in the course of doing the work of the United States of America, they took stances that the Kremlin opposed. Among those listed was a congressional staffer who helped write the Magnitsky sanctions act and former U.S Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul, who served as the point person during the Obama Administration and as Ambassador to Russia from 2012 to 2014. During McFauls time as Ambassador to Russia, the Kremlin unleashed its hybrid warfare playbook against him. They denounced him as an enemy and had security forces follow his family. The Kremlin also deployed a disinformation campaign against him that accused him of being a pedophile. The Kremlin was using these active measures in an attempt to instill fear in him and others that they could be killed, hurt, or jailed for doing the work of the U.S Government. The United States and Western countries more broadly must understand that these attacks are not random they are part of a pattern, a doctrine of hybrid warfare being expressed across the globe. We need to understand that assassinations, violence, threats, and intimidation are tools and tactics that Putin is using to achieve strategic or foreign policy goals, and these activities are harming our national security. For instance, the New York Times reported in August that vital Kremlin informants have gone silent, leaving our intelligence community in the dark about what Russias plans are for Novembers midterm elections. The report continues that American officials familiar with the intelligence concluded they have gone to ground amid more aggressive counterintelligence by Moscow, including efforts to kill spies. These are not just brutal tragedies or incidents the use of dirty active measures are purposeful and are intended to advance Putins agenda short of using tools of conventional warfare. The United States must lead with strong denouncements against dirty active measures and all other hybrid tactics used by Russia or any other country. It is particularly critical that the President denounce Russian threats against U.S officials for their actions in carrying out U.S foreign policy or advancing our national security interests. Instead, the Presidents deference to Putin at Helsinki sent the wrong signal to Putin in the face of his threats. Fortunately, the Senate has taken some action, including voting 98 to 0 to protect our diplomats and other government officials implementing U.S policy after Putin requested they be turned over for questioning. However, our government must speak with one voice and send consistent messages that this kind of action will not be tolerated and that Putin will pay consequences for his behavior. While it is important that we respond to these attacks, including with unequivocal denouncements of these tactics by the President and by the Congress, we should not be in the business of trying to respond to these attacks symmetrically. Putin resorts to using these tactics because he believes they give him an advantage over the West. We need to stay true to our ideals of democracy, human rights, and liberty. Page S6766 We dont need to normalize or legitimize these methods by engaging in them ourselves. Doing so would simply create a false moral equivalence that plays right into Putins hands. Instead, we must employ responses that play to our strengths. We stand for transparency and accountability in the United States. We stand for the rule of law. We must develop and implement a comprehensive strategy that deploys tools that are consistent with and showcase these values. We must shine a light on corruption at the highest levels of the Putin regime. We must shine a light on how Putins cronies are hiding their ill-gotten gains in the West. We must deploy a systematic and strategic messaging campaign that counters the base of Putins power, reputation, and funding. We must take these actions in concert with our allies and partners. In response to the Skripal poisoning, the United States expelled 60 Russian diplomats, joining with more than 25 ally and partner nations in applying diplomatic pressure on Russia. This action sent a strong signal that the world would not allow Putin to act with impunity. When we act together with our allies and partners to push back against these hybrid operations, it imposes a cost to Putins reputation on the world stage, which thwarts one of his major strategic interests. While these steps were in the right direction, they have been undermined by the Presidents words and actions. Despite punitive measures in response to the Skripal poisoning, the Kremlin thought that the Helsinki summit erased that damage. Press reports indicate that Western and U.S intelligence agencies assessed that the Kremlin was pleased with the outcome of the summit at Helsinki and is confused as to why President Trump is not implementing more Russia-friendly policies. One important tool in our arsenal for holding the Kremlin accountable is sanctions, including those on Putins inner circle. In particular, sanctions implemented under the Magnitsky Act appear to be particularly threatening to him. This act was passed in response to the death of Sergei Magnitsky, who uncovered massive tax fraud and corruption that was traced back to Kremlin officials. He was arrested in Russia and placed in jail, where he was tortured until he died. The origins of the Magnitsky Act were to hold accountable those in the Russian Government who were complicit in Magnitskys abuse and death by sanctioning their assets and barring them from receiving American visas. Subsequently, the Magnitsky Act has been expanded to include others who are culpable of acts of significant corruption and abuse. Russia expert Heather Conley of the Center for Strategic and International Studies testified recently at a Banking Committee hearing about the significance of the Magnitsky sanctions to Putin. She said Because the Kremlin has based its economic model and its survival on kleptocracy, sanctions and other policy instruments dedicated to preventing the furtherance of corruption--or worse yet in the minds of the Kremlin, to providing accurate information to the Russian people of the extent of this corruption--are a powerful countermeasure to Russias malign behavior. The Magnitsky sanctions, along with those designated under the Countering Americas Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, or CAATSA, threaten Putins power structure and present a counter-narrative of corruption and abuse by the Kremlin. We need to continue to use these sanctions to hold those who are complicit in dirty active measures and those who are responsible for aggression, corruption, and interfering in our elections accountable. Ratcheting up sanctions on those in Putins inner circle is a way to make Putin and his cronies feel pain and has the potential to change their behavior. Additional sanctions should be imposed on oligarchs and high-ranking government officials to target Putins base of power and further expose the corrupt nature of their sources of income. We should also consider declassifying the so-called 241 report compiled by the intelligence community along with the Departments of Treasury and State. This report required an assessment of the net worth of senior Kremlin officials and oligarchs, their relationship to Putin and his inner circle, and evidence of corrupt practices. If we were to release such a report--with redactions for portions with national security implications--to the public, it would further expose malign activity and unexplained streams of wealth. Congress has provided many tools for the administration to implement, and it is time to utilize them fully. Implementing them in a transparent, public manner is likely to cause reputational harm to Putin himself and restore a level of confidence in the administration here at home. However, specifically targeting sanctions this way is unlikely to cause large-scale harm to the Russian people or to our European allies. It is very clear that implementing sanctions is far more effective when done with the cooperation of the international community. The most effective sanctions regimes are those that are implemented in a multilateral fashion. I urge the administration to engage with our allies and partners to coordinate sanctions enforcement and further escalatory steps as warranted. That includes working through diplomatic channels to ensure that the sanctions placed on Russia by the European Union remain in place. A coordinated front of the United States and our European allies provides the greatest chance of successful implementation of sanctions and deterring further aggression by Russia. The administration must also place a premium on exerting diplomatic pressure to isolate those who flout or do not enforce sanctions on Russia. Another form of pressure should be an increase in assistance to pro- democracy and civil society groups in Russia and in nations of the former Soviet Union. Working with these groups in conjunction with our allies, partners, and the private sector would provide another means of raising the costs of Putin and his oligarchs. Putin is threatened by the success of democracies and private enterprise. In addition to sanctions, we must continue to play a strong role in law enforcement, along with our allies and partners. That includes aggressive prosecution of murders and threats of violence to limit the impunity. With Litvinenko, it took almost 10 years for the United Kingdom to have an official inquiry into the assassination. The United Kingdom has acted quicker in the wake of the Skripal poisoning, moving to identify suspects and hold the Kremlin accountable for these actions. We need to adopt UKs lessons learned to ensure that those who seek to use these weapons will be prosecuted fully and without delay. We have missed too many of these dirty active measures operations for far too long. We must recognize this is an element of Russias hybrid warfare. We must not fail to have the imagination to see what is happening right before our eyes. We must do more to identify and attribute these attacks from Russia. These attacks have only grown more brazen and will not stop unless we take strong measures to counter them and send the message that dirty active measures are unacceptable and will be costly to Russia or any other country which uses them.

In fact, Tribune Publishing  which owns dozens of newspapers including the LA Times and the Chicago Tribune  spent 140 million just on newsprint and ink in 2014, according to Brooks.ltnlgt YouTubeAll told, Brooks projects that if Tribune Publishing goes from the current model to the Netflix of news model, the company would drastically reduce revenue, that would be more than offset by the increase in its earnings.ltnlgt Given these cost cuts and forecast revenues, our estimated 2019 EBITDA estimate is over 70 higher than under our base case, said Brooks. This is due to the higher assumed margins for a digital news platform - we think margins in print are held down by the ball and chain that is the printing press.ltnlgt Part of the cost savings would come from lower staffing related to print production, but Brooks points out that those jobs would probably be lost anyway as the print product declines on its current course.ltnlgt Brooks concludes that this sort of drastic move is an opening for any newspaper company, they just have to seize it.ltnlgt As yet there is no digital company that dominates the news category in the same way as Amazon in retail, Netflix in video and Google in search. We therefore see an opportunity for newspapers to invest with a view of becoming the Netflix of News.ltnlgtNOW WATCH This is nuts Watch Russian adrenaline junkies perform daring tricks atop a 40-story building2ltnlgtSee Also Japanese children as young as 6 or 7 take the subway and run errands alone  heres why3Elon Musk The Model X is so advanced we probably shouldnt have built it423 romantic photos of Michelle and Barack Obama on their 23rd anniversary5 SEE ALSO Here are the 14 most affordable housing markets in the US6ltnlgt  1  2  3  4  5  6",affordable housing
baltimore,Being Black in America Can Be Hazardous to Your Health,2018-06-11T00:00:00Z,The Atlantic,The Baltimore Sun,"To Kiarra, the weight sometimes felt like a great burden, and at other times like just another fact of life. She had survived a childhood marred by death, drugs, and violence. She had recently gained control over her addiction to alcohol, which, last summer, had brought her to a residential recovery center in the citys Sandtown neighborhood, made famous by the Freddie Gray protests in 2015. But she still struggled with binge eating-so much so that she would eat entire plates of quesadillas or mozzarella sticks in minutes.To hear more feature stories, see our full list or get the Audm iPhone app.As the bus rattled past rowhouses and corner stores, Kiarra told me she hadnt yet received the Cpap breathing machine she needed for her sleep apnea. The extra fat seemed to constrict her airways while she slept, and a sleep study had shown that she stopped breathing 40 times an hour. She remembered one doctor saying, Im scared youre going to die in your sleep. In the haze of alcoholism, shed never followed up on the test. Now doctors at Bon Secours were trying to order the machine for her, but insurance hurdles had gotten in the way.Kiarras weight brought an assortment of old-person problems to her 27-year-old life sleep apnea, diabetes, and menstrual dysregulation, which made her worry she would never have children. For a while, shed ignored these issues. Day to day, her size mostly made it hard to shop for clothes. But the severity of her situation sank in when a diabetic friend had to have a toe amputated. Kiarra visited the woman in the hospital. She saw her tears and her red, bandaged foot, and resolved not to become an amputee herself.Kiarra arrived at the hospital early and waited in the cafeteria. Bon Secours is one of several world-class hospitals in Baltimore. Another, Johns Hopkins Hospital, is in some respects the birthplace of modern American medicine, having invented everything from the medical residency to the surgical glove. But of course not even the best hospitals in America can keep you from getting sick in the first place.It was lunchtime, but Kiarra didnt have any cash-her job, working the front desk at the recovery center where she lived, paid a stipend of just 150 a week. When she did have money, she often sought comfort in fast food. But when her cash and food stamps ran out, she sometimes had what she called hungry nights, when she went to bed without having eaten anything all day.When Id first met Kiarra, a few months earlier, Id been struck by how upbeat she seemed. Her recovery center-called Maryland Community Health Initiatives, but known in the neighborhood as Penn North-sits on a grimy street crowded with men selling drugs. Some of the centers clients, fresh off their habits, seemed withdrawn, or even morose. Kiarra, though, had the bubbly demeanor of a student-council president.She described the rough neighborhoods where shed grown up as fun and familylike. She said that although neither of her parents had been very involved when she was a kid, her grandparents had provided a loving home. Regarding her diabetes, she told me she was grateful that its reversible. After finishing her addiction treatment, she planned to reenroll in college and move into a dorm.Now, though, a much more anxious Kiarra sat before her doctor, a young white man named Tyler Gray, who began by advising Kiarra to get a Pap smear.Do we have to do it today? she asked.Is there something youre concerned about or nervous about?, Gray asked.Kiarra was nervous about a lot of things. She deals by not dealing, as she puts it, but lately shed had to deal with so much. Ever since the diabetes thing, I hate hearing I have something else, she said softly, beginning to cry. Ive been fat for what seems like so long, and now I get all the fat problems.I dont want to be fat, she added, but I dont know how to not be fat.Kiarras struggles with her weight are imbued with this sense, that getting thin is a mystery she might never solve, that diet secrets are literally secret. On a Sunday, she might diligently make a meal plan for the week, only to find herself reaching for Popeyes fried chicken by Wednesday. She blames herself for her poor health-as do many of the people I met in her community, where obesity, diabetes, and heart disease are ubiquitous. They said theyd made bad choices. They used food, and sometimes drugs, to soothe their pain. But these individual failings are only part of the picture.In Baltimore, a 20-year gap in life expectancy exists between the citys poor, largely African American neighborhoods and its wealthier, whiter areas. A baby born in Cheswolde, in Baltimores far-northwest corner, can expect to live until age 87. Nine miles away in Clifton-Berea, near where The Wire was filmed, the life expectancy is 67, roughly the same as that of Rwanda, and 12 years shorter than the American average. Similar disparities exist in other segregated cities, such as Philadelphia and Chicago.These cities are among the most extreme examples of a national phenomenon Across the United States, black people suffer disproportionately from some of the most devastating health problems, from cancer deaths and diabetes to maternal mortality and preterm births. Although the racial disparity in early death has narrowed in recent decades, black people have the life expectancy, nationwide, that white people had in the 1980s-about three years shorter than the current white life expectancy. African Americans face a greater risk of death at practically every stage of life.Except in the case of a few specific ailments, such as nondiabetic kidney disease, scientists have largely failed to identify genetic differences that might explain racial health disparities. The major underlying causes, many scientists now believe, are social and environmental forces that affect African Americans more than most other groups.To better understand how these forces work, I spent nearly a year reporting in Sandtown and other parts of Baltimore. What I found in Kiarras struggle was the story of how one persons efforts to get better-imperfect as they may have been-were made vastly more difficult by a daunting series of obstacles. But it is also a bigger story, of how African Americans became stuck in profoundly unhealthy neighborhoods, and of how the legacy of racism can literally take years off their lives. Far from being a relic of the past, Americas racist and segregationist history continues to harm black people in the most intimate of ways-seeping into their lungs, their blood, even their DNA.When Kiarra was a little girl, Baltimore was, as it is today, mired in violence, drugs, and poverty. In 1996, the city had the highest rate of drug-related emergency-room visits in the nation and one of the countrys highest homicide rates.Related EventWatch the author, Olga Khazan, discuss her story and persistent health disparities in Baltimore.With her father in and out of jail for robbery and drug dealing, Kiarra and her mother, three siblings, and three cousins piled into her grandmothers home. It was a joyous but chaotic household. Kiarra describes her grandmother as Gods assistant-a deeply religious woman who, despite a house bursting with hungry mouths, would still make an extra dinner for the addicts on the block. Kiarras mother, meanwhile, was the hood princess, a woman who would do her hair just to go to the grocery store. She was a teen mom, like her own mother had been.Many facets of Kiarras youth-the fact that her parents werent together, her fathers incarceration, the guns on the corners-are what researchers consider adverse childhood experiences, stressful events early in life that can cause health problems in adulthood. An abnormally large proportion of the children in Baltimore-nearly a third-have two or more aces. People with four or more aces are seven times as likely to be alcoholics as people with no aces, and twice as likely to have heart disease. One study found that six or more aces can cut life expectancy by as much as 20 years. Kiarra had at least six.She and others I interviewed recall the inner-city Baltimore of their youth fondly. Everyone lived crammed together with siblings and cousins, but people looked out for one another neighbors hosted back-to-school cookouts every year, and people took pride in their homes. Kiarra ran around with the other kids on the block until her grandma called her in each night at 8 oclock. She made the honor roll in fifth grade and got to speak in front of the whole class. She read novels by Sister Souljah and wrote short stories in longhand.Yet Kiarra also describes some jarring incidents. When she was 8, she heard a loud bop bop bop outside and ran out to find her stepbrother lying in the street, dead. One friend died of asthma in middle school another went to jail, then hanged himself. Other people I spoke with around Penn North and other recovery facilities had similarly traumatic experiences. It seemed like every second person I met told me they had been molested as a child, and even more said their family members had struggled with addiction.Kiarra told me she got pregnant by a friend when she was 12, and gave birth to a boy when she was 13. Within a year, the baby died unexpectedly, and Kiarra was so traumatized that she ended up spending more than a month in a psychiatric hospital. When she came home, her boyfriend physically and sexually abused her. He slapped me so hard, I was seeing stars, she said.She took solace in eating, a common refuge for victims of abuse. One 2013 study of thousands of women found that those who had been severely physically or sexually abused as children had nearly double the risk of food addiction. Kiarra ate everything, anything, she said, mostly bad foods, junk food, pizza, along with chicken boxes-the fried-chicken-and-fries combos slung by Baltimores carryout joints.At first, she thought the extra weight looked good on her. Then she started feeling fat. Eventually, she said, it was like, Fuck it. Im fat. As her high-school graduation approached, she tried on the white gown shed bought just weeks earlier and realized that it was already too tight.Kiarra didnt know many college-educated people, but she wanted to go to Spelman, a historically black college in Georgia, and join a sorority. Her family talked her out of applying, she said. Instead, she enrolled in one local college after another, but she kept dropping out, sometimes to help her siblings with their children and other times because she simply lost interest. After accumulating 30,000 in student loans, she had only a years worth of credits.So Kiarra put college on hold and worked at Kmart and as a home health aide-solid jobs but, as she likes to say, not my ceiling. She longed for a purpose. Sometimes, she had an inkling that she was meant to be an important person she would picture herself giving a speech to an auditorium full of people. But she remained depressed, stuck, and, increasingly, obese.She began doing ecstasy, and, later, downing a pint of vodka a day. She remembers coming to her home-health-aide job drunk one time and leaving a patient on the toilet. Did you forget me? the woman asked, half an hour later. Kiarra broke down crying.Soon after, she checked into Penn North for her first try at recovery. This past years attempt is her third.Sandtown is 97 percent black, and half of its families live in poverty. Its homicide rate is more than double that of the rest of the city, and last year about 8 percent of the deaths there were due to drug and alcohol overdose. Still, its top killers are heart disease and cancer, which African Americans nationwide are more likely to die from than other groups are.The way African Americans became trapped in Baltimores poorest-and least healthy-neighborhoods mirrors their history in the ghettos of other major cities. It began with outright bans on their presence in certain neighborhoods in the early 1900s and continued through the 2000s, when policy makers, lenders, and fellow citizens employed subtler forms of discrimination.In the early 1900s, blacks in Baltimore disproportionately suffered from tuberculosis, so much so that one area not far from Penn North was known as the lung block. In 1907, an investigator hired by local charities described what she saw in Meyer Court, a poor area in Baltimore. The contents of an outdoor toilet were found streaming down the center of this narrow court to the street beyond, she wrote. The smell within one house was osickening No provision of any kind is made for supplying the occupants of this court with water. Yet one cause, the housing investigator concluded, was the residents low standards and absence of ideals.When blacks tried to flee to better areas, some had their windows smashed and their steps smeared with tar. In 1910, a Yale-educated black lawyer named George McMechen moved into a house in a white neighborhood, and Baltimore reacted by adopting a segregation ordinance that The New York Times called the most pronounced Jim Crow measure on record. Later, neighborhood associations urged homeowners to sign covenants promising never to sell to African Americans.For much of the 20th century, the Federal Housing Administration declined to insure mortgages for blacks, who instead had to buy homes by signing contracts with speculators who demanded payments that, in many cases, amounted to most of the buyers income. As a result, many black families never reaped the gains of homeownership-a key source of Americans wealth. Housing discrimination persisted well beyond the Jim Crow years, as neighborhood associations rejected proposals to build low-income housing in affluent suburbs. In the 1990s, house flippers would buy up homes in Baltimores predominantly black neighborhoods and resell them to unsuspecting first-time home buyers at inflated prices by using falsified documents. The subsequent foreclosures are a major reason so many properties in the city sit vacant today.Some of Baltimores rowhouses are so long-forsaken, they have trees growing through the windows. These dilapidated homes are in themselves harmful to peoples health. Neighborhoods with poorly maintained houses or a large number of abandoned properties, for instance, face a high risk of mouse infestation. Every year, more than 5,000 Baltimore children go to the emergency room for an asthma attack-and according to research from Johns Hopkins, mouse allergen is the biggest environmental factor in those attacks.The allergen, found in mouse urine, travels through the air on dust, and Johns Hopkins researchers have found high levels of it on most of the beds of poor Baltimore kids they have tested. When kids inhale the allergen, it can spark inflammation and mucus buildup in their lungs, making them cough and wheeze. These attacks can cause long-term harm Children with asthma are more likely to be obese and in overall poorer health as adults. Getting rid of the mice requires sealing up cracks and holes in the house-a process that can cost thousands of dollars, given the state of many Baltimore homes.The mice, of course, are just one symptom of the widespread neglect that can set in once neighborhoods become as segregated as Baltimores are. One study estimated that, in the year 2000, racial segregation caused 176,000 deaths-about as many as were caused by strokes.All summer, Penn Norths aging air conditioners strained against the soupy heat outside. For Kiarra, the first few months at the recovery center felt like boot camp. The staff woke the residents before 7 a.m., even if they didnt have anywhere in particular to be. Kiarras days were packed with therapies acupuncture in the mornings, meant to help reduce cravings individual meetings with peer counselors Narcotics Anonymous sessions, in which dozens of strangers slumped on metal folding chairs and told stories of past drug binges.Once a week, Kiarra would leave her post at the front desk and walk across an empty playground for an appointment with her psychotherapist, Ms. Bea who asked that I not use her full name. Kiarra would climb the steep, narrow staircase of Penn Norths clinical building, then stop at the landing to catch her breath.Healing the Divide Kiarras StoryMs. Beas goal was to help Kiarra understand how her substance abuse, her weight, and her difficult childhood were interconnected. Like many young people in Baltimore, Kiarra had spent her life trying to attain ordinary things-love, respect-that seemed always to skid beyond her grasp. She wanted male attention, but then she got pregnant. The baby made her happy, but the baby died. Her siblings started having kids and she loved them, but she was jealous. She fell into a deep-sink depression. Shed eat a second dinner, then get so drunk that shed scream at her friends. Shed realize that she was going to wake up to a blistering hangover and would keep drinking. It was coming anyway, so why not? Struggle days, she called these times.During one appointment in August, Kiarra told Ms. Bea that she had been attending Overeaters Anonymous meetings by phone. Something another member had shared, about why people are sometimes reluctant to shed weight, had stuck with her. He was saying when you lose the fat, you lose a part of you, Kiarra recalled.A few years earlier, she had founded a club for plus-size women called Beautiful Beyond Weight, with some of her best friends. The goal was to help overweight women feel better about themselves. They put on fashion shows that she described as Beyonc big, but on a Christina Aguilera budget. She worried that if she lost too much weight, the other girls in the club would think she was a hypocrite. She decided she would aim to be slim-thicc-not too skinny.So imagine if you were a size 14, Ms. Bea said. What would be happening here-with you?Ms. Bea was trying to help Kiarra see how she sometimes uses her size as a form of protection, a way of making her feel invisible to men, so that she could eventually work through her fear.In Kiarras experience, disappearing could be useful. She told me that once, when she was 17, before she had gotten so big, she met a guy in an online chat room. She went over to his place, where they watched TV and started having sex. But then-the skid-his three friends barged into the room and raped her. She fled, half-dressed, as soon as she could.Yeah, Kiarra said, envisioning herself many sizes smaller. I wouldnt be able to take it.Kiarra has trouble concentrating sometimes, and she thinks the reason might be that she and her brother were exposed to lead from old paint. When Kiarra was 6, her grandmother heard that a girl living in another property owned by the same landlord had been hospitalized. She took Kiarra to get tested. The results showed that the concentration of lead in her blood was more than six times the level the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers elevated-an amount that can irreversibly lower IQ and reduce attention span. Kiarra, too, was hospitalized, for a month.Scientists and industry experts knew in the 19th century that lead paint was dangerous. Lead is a merciless poison, an executive with a Michigan lead-paint company admitted in a book in 1892. It gradually affects the nerves and organs of circulation to such a degree that it is next to impossible to restore them to their normal condition. But as late as the 1940s and 50s, trade groups representing companies that made lead products, including the Lead Industries Association, promoted the use of lead paint in homes and successfully lobbied for the repeal of restrictions on that use. Lead-paint companies published coloring books and advised their salesmen to not forget the children-some day they may be customers. According to The Baltimore Sun, a study in 1956 found that lead-poisoned children in the slums of Baltimore had six times as much lead in their systems as severely exposed workers who handled lead for a living.In speeches and publications, Lead Industries Association officials cast childhood lead poisoning as vanishingly rare. When they did acknowledge the problem, they blamed slum children for chewing on wood surfaces-gnaw-ledge, as Manfred Bowditch, the groups health-and-safety director, called it-and their ignorant parents for allowing them to do so. In a letter to the Baltimore health department, Bowditch called the lead-poisoned toddlers little human rodents.Even after stricter regulations came along, landlords in segregated neighborhoods-as well as the citys own public-housing agency-neglected properties, allowing old paint to chip and leaded dust to accumulate. Some landlords, seeking to avoid the expense of renovating homes and the risk of tenant lawsuits, refused to rent to families with children, since they would face the greatest risk from lead exposure. Poor families feared that if they complained about lead, they might be evicted.Partly because of Marylands more rigorous screening, the states lead-poisoning rate for children was 15 times the national average in the 90s the majority of the poisoned children lived in the poor areas of Baltimore. In some neighborhoods, 70 percent of children had been exposed to lead. The citys under-resourced agencies failed to address the problem. Clogged by landlords who hid behind shell companies, Baltimores lead-paint enforcement system had ground to a halt by the time Kiarra was poisoned. According to Tapping Into The Wire, a book co-authored by Peter L. Beilenson, the citys former health commissioner, Baltimore didnt bring a single lead-paint enforcement action against landlords in the 90s. A subsequent crackdown on landlords has lowered lead-poisoning rates dramatically.When Kiarra was 14, her family sued their landlord for damages, but their lawyer dropped the case because the landlord claimed he had no money and no insurance with which to compensate them. Kiarra remembers her grandmother not wanting to give up, demanding of the lawyer, What do you mean theres nothing you can do?-only to get lost in a tangle of legal rules she didnt fully understand.On a hot Saturday this past August, Kiarra brought her nieces with her to work and corralled them in the front office. She was babysitting that day, and staffing was short at the center. The girls climbed restlessly on the stained office chairs and under the tables.Kiarra is close with her family. She spends much of her free time texting her favorite sisters on her cracked cellphone, and she talks to her grandmother every few days. Any familial strife upsets her deeply She can vividly recount a long list of times her mother disappointed her. Then again, sometimes she feels like shes the one who has let everyone down, with all her drinking and dropping out.Near the end of the day, Kiarras cellphone rang. It was her father, calling to yell at her because she hadnt come to see him recently. Ive been busy, Kiarra told him.When Kiarra was little, and when her father wasnt incarcerated, he had provided for his children-unlike many dads she knew. Shed sought his approval by researching Islam, his religion, and trying to reconcile it with the strict Christianity of her grandmothers home. A few years ago, she tried to impress him by joining a tough-seeming social club that turned out to be too much like a gang. It wasnt a good fit, she told me.On some level, she still respected her father. But he had an explosive personality and struggled with depression and addiction. Kiarra told me he taught her what men are supposed to be fierce protectors who sometimes turn their wrath on the women in their lives.Kiarra usually tried to see her fathers outbursts as a cry for help. But today, she decided to confront him. Their conversation escalated as they accused each other of failing at fatherhood and daughterhood.How many of my plays have you been to?, Kiarra demanded.Her father launched into a tirade. I will come for your fucking dumb ass!, I overheard him yell at one point. You going to respect me!Respect works both ways, Kiarra said. Im not that little girl thats gonna let you slap the shit out of me.What bothered Kiarra most was that her father had never hit his other daughter that way, so why her? Why did it feel like he was always rejecting her? Her father later confirmed that he had hit her as a child, saying, Discipline is a must, whatever form you choose.As he continued screaming-Im gonna put your fuckin head in the dirt-Kiarras eyes glazed over. Death gotta be better than here, she said.She hung up, then wiped away tears. Just today, he had called her at 1230 a.m., 348 a.m., 747 a.m., 1124 a.m., 333 p.m., and 444 p.m. One time when she didnt answer the phone, Kiarra said, he showed up in person at Penn North.Her father called back, rambling less coherently than before. How much of my life did you spend incarcerated?, Kiarra asked him. When she was little, she would go out hustling with him. I was 14 fucking years old seeing dead fucking bodies, and youre talking about where the fuck did this drinking shit come from?Kiarra hung up, this time for good. Then she wept. As long as Im fucked up, this man is cool, but as soon as I decide I want to get my fucking life together its like  Her voice trailed off. She turned and told me she wanted to go to McDonalds. McDonalds is killing me, she said, but its a special treat.She ordered her usual-a McDouble and a McChicken, along with a sweet tea-and waited silently amid the beeping of the cash registers.Most of the people I met at Penn North were optimistic and surrounded by fiercely loyal friends. But their lives also seemed, like Kiarras, unrelentingly stressful. Between the hugs and handshakes, I heard a lot of trepidation. I have to move again Where will I go? Will I get this job at Target? Will I ever walk again? Will I get to eat today?Research shows that this kind of day-in, day-out worry can ravage a persons health. Certain stressful experiences-such as living in a disordered, impoverished neighborhood-are associated with a shortening of the telomeres, structures that sit on the tips of our chromosomes, which are bundles of DNA inside our cells. Often compared to the plastic caps on the ends of shoelaces, telomeres keep chromosomes from falling apart. They can also be a measure of how much a body has been ground down by life.Some researchers think stress shrinks telomeres, until they get so short that the cell dies, hastening the onset of disease. Different kinds of prolonged emotional strain can affect telomeres. In one study, mothers who had high stress levels had telomeres that were as short as those of a person about a decade older. Another study found that children who spent part of their childhood in Romanian orphanages had telomeres that shortened rapidly.Arline T. Geronimus, an expert on health disparities at the University of Michigan, has found that African Americans have more stress-related wear and tear in their bodies than white people do, and the difference widens with age. By measuring telomere length in hundreds of women, Geronimus estimated that black women were, biologically, about seven and a half years older than white women of the same age.Unrelenting stress also affects our daily behaviors Stress causes some people to eat more, especially calorically dense foods, and to sleep less. On average, African Americans get about 40 minutes less sleep each night than white people do. Among women in one recent study, poor sleep alone explained more than half the racial disparity in cardiovascular-disease risk.Living in a dangerous neighborhood like Sandtown requires a vigilance that can flood the body with adrenaline and cortisol. These hormones are supposed to kick in only long enough for us to get away from an immediate threat. If they trickle through us constantly, they can raise the risk of heart disease and compromise the bodys immune system.These kinds of changes in body chemistry arent limited to people living in poverty. Even well-off black people face daily racial discrimination, which can have many of the same biological effects as unsafe streets. Thomas LaVeist, the dean of Tulanes School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, has found, for example, that even among people earning 175,000 a year or more, blacks are more likely to suffer from certain diseases than whites are.In an emerging field of research, scientists have linked stress, including from prejudice, to compounds called methyl groups attaching to our genes, like snowflakes sticking to a tree branch. These methyl groups can cause genes to turn on or off, setting disease patterns in motion. Recently, a study linked racial discrimination to changes in methylation on genes that affect schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and asthma.Several studies also show that experiencing racism might be part of the reason black women are about 50 percent more likely than white women to have premature babies and about twice as likely to have low-birth-weight babies. Researchers think the stress they experience might cause the body to go into labor too soon or to mount an immune attack against the fetus. This disparity, too, does not appear to be genetic Black women from sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean are less likely to have preterm births than African American women are, possibly because theyve spent less time living in Americas racist environment.Throughout the fall, Kiarra kept her doctor appointments, and she began working out at the small gym at Penn North, placing a picture of Chrissy Lampkin, the curvaceous girlfriend of the rapper Jim Jones, on her treadmill as motivation.But Kiarra still wasnt losing much weight. Like most Americans, she got advice from her friends on what to eat-but that advice at times proved confusing and contradictory. She tried a boiled-egg diet, which left her with hunger pangs and a lot of leftover eggs in the fridge. She went seven days without meat but wound up eating more starches, which sent her blood sugar soaring.One bright day in late September, Kiarra returned to Bon Secours to see Ebony Hicks, a behavioral-health consultant who, like Kiarras doctor, works through Health Care for the Homeless, a Baltimore nonprofit that cares for the very poor. Hicks began by asking Kiarra what her goal was. Kiarra said getting down to an even 200 pounds would be awesome. Her weight remained, stubbornly, about 150 pounds higher than that. But she stayed optimistic, writing down Hickss aphorisms about needing to be patient and not expecting immediate results-Anything overnight usually lasts about a night!-in a notebook shed brought with her.Gently, Hicks asked Kiarra what she had eaten that day.French fries, Kiarra said.All youve had is french fries?, Hicks asked.Mm-hmm.It was 330 in the afternoon.They walked to a room across the hall, and Kiarra stepped onto a scale.I gained two pounds, she said quickly, so now Im depressed. I eat too much.We have to work on getting you more regularly eating throughout the day, Hicks said.Kiarra asked whether detox tea, something shed heard about from a friend, was healthy.You can detox with lots of fiber-filled vegetables, Hicks said.Whats that?, Kiarra asked.Hicks pulled up a web page describing fruits and vegetables that contain fiber. She listed them off one by one.Would Kiarra eat avocados?No.Coconut? Also no.I do eat berries, Kiarra said. Lets put that down. Kiarra doesnt know why she dislikes so many fruits and vegetables. Her grandmother cooked healthy meals, putting turkey in big pots of greens for flavor. She had a rule that you could never leave the table without eating your vegetables. Kiarra would fall asleep at the table.Hicks gamely pressed on. Peas? You like peas?I think Im going to throw up, Kiarra said, grimacing.Chickpeas, Hicks offered. You ever ate hummus?What is hummus?Fried food has long been Kiarras legal high-cheap, easily acquired, something to brighten the gloomiest day. It is also one of the few luxuries around.Predominantly black neighborhoods tend to become what researchers call food swamps, or areas where fast-food joints outnumber healthier options. Food deserts, by contrast, simply lack grocery stores. One study in New York found that as the number of African Americans who lived in a given area increased, so did the distance to the nearest clothing store, pharmacy, electronics store, office-supply store. Meanwhile, one type of establishment drew nearer fast-food restaurants.Thats not a coincidence. After the riots of the 1960s, the federal government began promoting the growth of small businesses in minority neighborhoods as a way to ease racial tensions. What we need is to get private enterprise into the ghetto, and put the people of the ghetto into private enterprises, President Richard Nixon said around the time he created the Office of Minority Business Enterprise, in 1969. As Chin Jou, a senior lecturer at the University of Sydney, describes in her book, Supersizing Urban America, fast-food companies were some of the most eager entrants into this ghetto market.Fast-food restaurants spent the next few decades rushing into urban markets, as one Detroit News report put it, seeking out these areas untapped labor force and concentrated audience. In the 1990s, the federal government gave fast-food restaurants financial incentives to open locations in inner cities, including in Baltimore. The urban expansion made business sense. The ethnic population is better for us than the general market, Sidney Feltenstein, Burger Kings executive vice president of brand strategy, explained to the Miami Herald in 1992. They tend to have larger families, and that means larger checks. Supermarket chains didnt share this enthusiasm in part because the widespread use of food stamps causes an uneven flow of customers throughout the month, they have largely avoided expanding in poor areas.Fast-food executives looked for ways to entice black customers. Burger King made ads featuring Shaft. KFC redecorated locations in cities like Baltimore to cater to stereotypically black tastes, and piped rap, rhythm and blues, and soul music into the restaurants, Jou writes. Employees were given new Afrocentric uniforms consisting of kente cloth dashikis. A study from 2005 found that TV programs aimed at African Americans feature more fast-food advertisements than other shows do, as well as more commercials for soda and candy. Black children today see twice as many soda and candy ads as white children do.The marketing and franchising onslaught worked, and the diets of low-income people changed dramatically. Before the rise of fast food and processed foods, many low-income black families grew their own food and ate lots of grains and beans. In 1965, one study found, poor and middle-income blacks ate healthier-though often more meager-diets than rich whites did. But over the next few decades, the price of meat, junk food, and simple carbohydrates plummeted, while the price of vegetables rose. By the mid-90s, 28 percent of African Americans were considered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to have a poor diet, compared with just 16 percent of whites.At Carver Vocational-Technical High School, which Kiarra and Freddie Gray attended at the same time, only about a third of students go on to enroll in college-yet another factor that could be contributing to the areas low life expectancy, given that college graduates outlive high-school dropouts in every racial category.One reason college graduates live longer, researchers believe, is that education endows people with the sense that they control their own destiny. Well-educated people seek out more nutritional information because theyve been told they can achieve anything-why not perfect health, too?Kiarra, by contrast, wasnt yet sure what she could accomplish. She wanted to live up to an image in her mind of a fly, crazy, daring, dream-chasing girl, but she cycled between getting excited about new possibilities and being flattened by setbacks. Sometimes, she would dream of turning Beautiful Beyond Weight into a business-one that would sell T-shirts and caps with empowering messages for plus-size women. But she wasnt really sure how to do that.When Kiarra felt especially adrift, she would visit Steve Dixon, Penn Norths director, in his tiny office at the end of the hall, and ask him for advice on finding her purpose. He would tell her to pray and meditate. When you pray, its like youre talking to God, Kiarra told me once. But when you meditate, its God talking to you.In November, some combination of prayer, meditation, and research led Kiarra to enroll in a medical-assistant training program. The class added another 7,000 to her student-loan debt, but Kiarra seemed to thrive in it, and a few weeks before Christmas, she was excitedly planning her postPenn North life. Once she had her medical-assistant certificate in hand, she would move to Philadelphia, get a job at Temple University, and take classes to become a registered nurse. Eventually, she hoped to become a nursing professor. That future held everything she wanted helping people, being a leader, making her own money, having her own place.Feeling chipper, she decided to browse the wigs at a nearby store, stroking the hairpieces and whispering to the best ones that she would be back for them on payday. She had a new reason to get dolled up a truck driver, fine as wine and with no kids-and, accordingly, no messy entanglement with another woman. She tried to boss him around, but he told her to mind her own business, and she kind of liked that. His birthday was approaching, and she wanted to take him someplace fancy. She would wear a black dress, and he would wear a black suit.To help pay for everything, Kiarra decided to register as a Lyft driver. All that was required was a 250 deposit she began calling around to different relatives to raise the money.Twenty-seventeen, she thought, had been her best year yet.A few weeks later, a bitter cold settled through the East Coast, and Kiarras sunny mood had faded. Things had ended with the truck driver over some mean Facebook posts and the fact that hed lied to her about not having kids. She was also reconsidering her plans for the future, now thinking that instead of setting her sights on Temple, she should focus on graduating and finding a job-any job-that would pay well enough and provide insurance that would cover her extensive health-care needs. Her grandmother said driving for Lyft in Baltimore was too dangerous. She might not move to Philly after all.But a new opportunity presented itself. Because of a change in her insurance plan, Kiarra had to switch doctors. Right away, her new doctor asked her whether she had considered bariatric surgery. Kiarra said she was scared of the complications, such as digestive problems and infections, but the doctor reassured her that complications are rare. She was interested in the gastric sleeve, a procedure that would dramatically reduce the size of her stomach, causing hormonal changes that would help her lose much of her body fat.Kiarra still felt conflicted about losing her identity as an overweight woman. She couldnt relate to the people on the Overeaters Anonymous calls who said they hated their bodies. She liked hers. People say, Hey, youre fat,o she said. And Im like, Thats obvious.o But she was motivated by her diabetes-which was already causing her vision to blur and her feet to tingle-along with the looming threat of other fat diseases, as she called them, frightening ones like heart failure. She figured that if she really wanted to have a successful plus-size clothing brand, shed at least have to live long enough to see it happen.She decided on the spot to go forward with the surgery, worried that she might change her mind otherwise. She signed up for the mandatory pre-op classes that prepare participants to eat just half a cup of food for every meal, at least initially, after the surgery. Her mother was nervous, but her sisters were all for it. Her grandmother told her to put it in Gods hands.Earlier that month, Kiarra had organized a birthday party for her 2-year-old niece, Brooklynn, in Penn Norths community room, decking out the dingy yellow walls with pink balloons and ribbons. Within a few weeks, it was decided that Kiarra would gain custody of Brooklynn for a while so that Kiarras sister could go back to get her high-school diploma.Kiarra was happy with this arrangement-she already sometimes referred to Brooklynn as her daughter-girl-and she began to see Brooklynn as a reason to stay on track. Juggling coursework and single parenthood exhausted her at times, but she wanted to be the successful role model for Brooklynn that she never had herself. In the chatty toddler who loved dress-up and Moana, Kiarra had found, if not her purpose, at least a purpose. It feels like the Earth is full, you know? she told me one day this spring.Her new status as the childs guardian meant that her stay at Penn North could be extended, through some alchemy of program definitions, for nearly another year. Staying on would mean cheap housing for Kiarra and Brooklynn, two people who desperately needed it.With that settled, Kiarra turned her attention to the six-month process of hoop-jumping that was required to qualify for the gastric-sleeve surgery. The first pre-op class was an hour and a half long and took place at a hospital 30 minutes from Penn North. Kiarra thought the time commitment seemed excessive with a smirk, she wondered aloud why the doctors couldnt just tell her and the other patients, Yall fat. We gonna cut you up.But the doctors needed Kiarra to understand that the surgery was not something to take lightly. To qualify, she would have to get her sleep apnea and diabetes under control. She would have to keep a food journal, submit to behavioral evaluations, write an essay explaining why she no longer wanted to be morbidly obese. For the rest of her life, shed need to wait 30 minutes between eating a meal and drinking a beverage. When one of Kiarras classmates said that after the surgery, eating too much would cause you to get violently sick for an hour, Kiarra recoiled a little.All of the rules and obligations seemed more intense than Kiarra had expected. Six months, youre going on like 16 appointments, she said. Whoo, thats a lot. Given all she had to contend with, I wondered whether she would end up meeting the requirements-and, given the stakes, what might happen to her if she didnt.Tony Conn, a Penn North staffer with whom Kiarra is close, calls her a wonderful, brilliant person. Early on in my reporting, he told me her biggest flaw is that she sometimes doesnt see things through to the end. As soon as something looks like its gonna come to light, shes like, Okay, I did that. So lets find something else,o he said.But lately, Kiarra had shown a new sense of calm and dedication. One day while she worked the front desk, an older man flirted with her as he signed the attendance sheet.When you look in the mirror, he said, and see how beautiful you are, what do you say to yourself?Weve come a long way, she said quietly. Lets stay there.",homeless

Operation Home Alone 2 was a monthslong operation aimed at combating child sexual exploitation in Pinal County, Arizona. The operation included agencies at all levels, including Immigration and Customs Enforcements Homeland Security Investigations, Arizona Department of Public Safety, Pinal Criminal Targeting Unit, Casa Grande Police Department, Maricopa Police Department, and the Pinal County Attorneys Office.88 A Criminal Enterprise, a.k.a. The Democratic Party89 Somewhere within the last few decades, the United States was taken over by a clandestine criminal enterprise working under the radar to infiltrate and gain control of our media, schools, universities, unions, Hollywood, military and our halls of governance at the local, state, and federal level. They did so in conjunction with a new American oligarchy composed of billionaires seeking a One World Order and all too willing to fund their operations, along with the aid of foreign financiers such as Red China and parts of the oil rich Islamist world. Within time, and with much of its funding coming from a billionaire oligarchy, they were able to hijack the entire Democrat Party who were only too willing to sell out the United States to the highest bidders while lining their own pockets with sweetheart deals made with Red China, Iran, and Ukraine. The admittance of Red China in 2001 into the World Trade Organization, backed and supported by Bill Clinton and Joe Biden, was the beginning of Chinas advance and the decline of the United States on the world stage. As American companies moved overseas along with the millions of lost jobs in cities throughout the United States, Democrats and some Republicans, sold us a bill of goods. They advanced the notion that we were moving towards a service economy and that cheap labor overseas meant cheaper products here at home. They failed to mention that the loss of our manufacturing industry to China, and in particular our pharmaceutical industry, posed a national security threat since China could threaten to stop selling essential goods to us. Nor did they mention that certain minerals, now mined in China, were critical to our military defense. These decisions were made against our national interests yet, no one in Washington protested.90 Baltimore on Pace for Deadliest Year Ever 46 Shot, 12 Killed Last Week91 As social unrest, wildfires, and hurricanes dominate the headlines, a surge in violent crime across major US metropolitan areas has also been observed since the virus-pandemic began in March.

Owens asked in a tweet, further explaining Because pea-brained celebrities that are idolized like LeBron James tell young black men that they are literally being hunted.96 Cher Dubs Trump a Mass Murderer,  Calls for His Execution97 In a now-deleted tweet, pop singer Cher appeared to call for the legal execution of President Trump, before continuing in an online rant that culminated with her expressing shame for her words.

The two officers were left fighting for their lives after being ambushed and shot at point-blank range through their patrol car window on Saturday night by an African-American gunman.110 How to Steal an Election, Part 2 The Rights Response111 The very publication of the Transition Integrity Project TIP report and the subsequent news media reporting about it are components of psychological warfare within the broader information warfare campaign aimed at spreading demoralizing rumors to Trump supporters. The goal is to break down and weaken support before, during and after election day. Demoralized and unmotivated supporters do not make their support for their candidate public. They do not campaign in neighborhoods or post yard signs. They do not vote. They do not volunteer at polling places. They become convinced their hopes are lost, and highly controversial cause. They do not wish to be called a racist, or a hater, or identified with other fringe elements. They stay at home and watch TV. Having been psychologically conditioned through the COVID-19 pandemic to withdraw, isolate, and lock-down  on largely fiat orders of various government officials  many Americans will react to the irregular and extra-legal tactics of the Left. The Left relies on this reaction to suppress voter turnout and use varying forms of terror, such as reprisals and the threats of reprisals, against those who do not cooperate or who challenge the projected accusations detailed in the TIP report. The TIP report is careful not to engage in sedition. They are a whisper away from advocating violence  but these are very sharp political operatives that are all lawyered-up, so they speak in code. Here are some examples for you to read between the lines112 ISIS Celebrate 911 Attacks as Pivotal Moment For Islam in First-Ever Statement on Twin Towers Anniversary113 ISIS has celebrated the 911 attacks that killed 2,977 people and injured 25,000 more as a pivotal moment in Islamic history.

US District Judge William Stickman IV, a Trump appointee, ruled on Monday in a 66-page opinion that the restrictions were overreaching, arbitrary, and violated citizens constitutional rights. Plaintiffs in the case include hair salons, a farmers market vendor, a horse trainer drive-in movie theaters, and several GOP lawmakers, according to 6ABC. The ruling means that the current restrictions  including limitations on the size of all gatherings, cannot be enforced.126 President Trump Sending Out 80M Unsolicited Ballots is Unfair, Total Fraud127 President Trump has continued to slam mail-in voting as a growing number of states are set to send out ballots. He has warned the process opens up the door for voter fraud. During a campaign rally in North Carolina earlier this week, he slammed states which are sending out unsolicited ballots and advised voters to confirm their ballot is counted. Make sure you send the ballot in, and then go to your polling place and make sure it counts, he stated. Make sure it gets in because the only way they can win is by doing very bad things, thats the only way. President Trump has previously said he supports absentee voting, where a ballot is sent to voters who request them. However, hes been highly critical of universal mail-in voting, where ballots are sent to voters regardless if they requested them or not.128 Report Meghan Markle Plans Netflix Doc on Marxist Black Lives Matter Founder129 The Duchess of Sussex, actress Meghan Markle, has reportedly pitched a documentary to Netflix on the life of the co-founder of the Black Lives Matter movement, after signing a 120 million deal with the American streaming giant according to a British newspaper.

David Peterson and his wife, who also happens to be an art professor at the same college, observed the protest on July 30th in Saratoga Springs. When students saw social media posts of them on the sidelines of the protest, they demanded the professor be fired. The college, however, has announced that it will not cater to the whims of the students and decided to ignore calls for the professor to be dismissed. But the president Marc Conner said that they were going to deal with such issues through ongoing community dialogue and that the college is committed to addressing both the subtle and the overt forms of racism that persist in every part of the American project.134 Texas Billboard Cautions Drivers to Enter Austin At Your Own Risk After City Reduces Police Budget135 The Texas Municipal Police Association launched a billboard campaign last week warning drivers to enter the state capital of Austin at your own risk after city officials reduced the police department budget.136 Top Democratic Fundraising Group ActBlue Took in Half of 2019 Donations From Untraceable, Unemployed Donors137 A major Democratic Party fundraising group called ActBlue has come under intense scrutiny from conservative watchdog groups after an analysis by the Take Back Action Fund found that more than half of the donations coming into the liberal organization came from people claiming to be unemployed.138 Trump Calls for Death Penalty for Cop Attackers139 President Trump called for the Death Penalty for a gunman who carried out a cold blooded attack on two Sheriffs Department deputies in LA, as sick protesters chanted we hope they die.

As the chants grew, Trump again brought up Clintons email scandal.146 Violent Protest Erupts in Lancaster Over an Obviously Justified Police Shooting147 Weve come a long way since the death of George Floyd. The initial outrage over Floyds death in late May was at least justified, but now, the violent protests rocking city streets are increasingly unmoored from any just cause or actual victim. Lancaster, Pennsylvania, offers the latest grim example of baseless unrest turning violent. More than 100 protesters took to the streets of Lancaster on Sunday night after a police shooting once again provoked viral outrage, and it wasnt peaceful. Agitators vandalized the police station, smashed windows, and threw bricks. Vandals also damaged several random private businesses and looted. They also damaged a post office and defaced city streets. Death to cops was spray-painted memorably on one building during the unrest.148 Watch Douglas Murray  America Has All the Bases Set for Civil War149 America has all the bases set for civil war, says author Douglas Murray. Those radicals seeking to destroy the U.S . from within should be careful what they wish for if they think the Anglo-American hegemony was bad, theyre going to have a hell of a time when they discover what the Chinese hegemony looks like.150 What Happened to Matt Drudge?151 Did he sell the Drudge Report? Or did he just sell out?152 Wildfires to Get Worse Thanks to Clinton Policies, Says Fire Expert Who Predicted Uptick in Blazes153 Former President Bill Clinton made a significant change to federal land management nearly 30 years ago that created the conditions necessary for massive wildfires to consume portions of the West Coast, according to one fire expert who predicted the problem years ago. Shortly before leaving office in 2001, Clinton limited the ability of the United States Forest Service to thin out a dense thicket of foliage and downed trees on federal land to bring the West into a pristine state, Bob Zybach, an experienced forester with a PhD in environmental science, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. The former presidents decision created a ticking time bomb, Zybach argues. If you dont start managing these forests, then they are going to start burning up. Thirty years later, they are still ignoring it, said Zybach, who spent more than 20 years as a reforestation contractor. He was referring to warnings he made years ago, telling officials that warding off prescribed burns in Oregon and California creates kindling fuelling fires.154 Yet Another Poll Oversamples Democrats as Pollsters Fail to Learn From 2016155 As weve noted numerous times over the past several years, a trick commonly employed by pollsters to achieve a desired outcome is oversampling  including more Democrats and left-leaning independents than Republicans and right-leaning independents in surveys in order to make it appear as though a candidate is doing better than they actually are.156 YouTube Censors White House Coronavirus Advisor Professor Scott Atlas for Contradicting WHO157 The latest instance of coronavirus-related censorship taking place on YouTube is shedding light on the giant as not only vigorously suppressing opposing voices, but also opposing science. At the same time, YouTubes decision to remove a video uploaded in June of an interview with Professor Scott Atlas, a senior fellow at Stanford Universitys Hoover Institution, and advisor to The White House, is shrouded in mystery. The justification given by the video giant is that Atlas failed to properly align his views with that of the World Health Organization WHO or local health authorities.158 Coronavirus Why You Are Now in Great Danger159 by Dr Vernon Coleman MB ChB DSc FRSA Today, it is clear that the cure, not the problem, is causing the crisis. Right at the beginning of the coronavirus affair I pointed out that according to the World Health Organisation, the ordinary flu kills between 250,000 and 600,000 people a year  most of them in the winter months. I said that if the coronavirus hadnt killed between 100,000 and 150,000 people around the world by the middle of April then it would be clear that it was not as dangerous as we had been told and, indeed, not as dangerous as the flu. Well, the authorities are claiming that the death rate from the corona has now reached 100,000. So is the coronavirus as deadly as the mathematicians and the politicians said it was? No  because they have fiddled the figures. Today, anyone who has the coronavirus, or is thought to have it even though they have not been tested, will be put down as having died of the coronavirus. Time and time again, the authorities report that someone died with the disease. Not of the disease. And yet those patients are put down as having died as a result of the coronavirus. So, if you fall downstairs and break your neck, but you had a cough before you died, then you will be classified as a coronavirus death. If you had a heart attack but were thought to have the coronavirus then you officially died of the coronavirus rather than the heart attack. A lack of widespread testing makes this possible. And post mortems have been abandoned for many patients.

She was 93. The photograph which was seen by millions around the world was taken by American journalist Julian Bryan on Sept. 13, 1939, and it depicts Kazimiera Mika, then a 12-year-old girl, kneeling over her fallen sister Anna. She had been killed in Warsaw by gunfire from a German fighter plane. The young 14-year-old who died had gone into a field to pick potatoes. She was shot by a Luftwaffe pilot in what was a gratuitous attack on civilians who were of no threat to the aircraft.164 French Philosopher Eric Zemmour We Know Where the Savagery Comes From But the Media Covers it Up165 While referring to Frances large migrant population, French philosopher and journalist Eric Zemmour said that even though the country is aware who is committing assaults and violent crimes, the media refuses to report on it. Zemmour made his remarks as a part of a guest panel for the Face lInfo television program, in which he discussed the influx of migrants to Europe and a corresponding increase in crime. Zemmour, an Algerian-born French Jew who works as a columnist for one of Frances top newspaper, Le Figaro, mainly pointed out that mainstream media ignores the stories of French citizens when they become the victims of migrant crimes, while the government would in many cases take the migrants side and the victims would become prosecuted by the authorities.166 Germanys Navy to Add New Warships  For Financial Purposes167 by Thomas O. Falk The German Navy is in the process of obtaining five new warships. However, the purchase, despite Germanys latest aspirations, is not intended to initiate a paradigm shift within the Bundeswehr but is instead about German efficiency  unfortunately. The Currently Subpar Status of Germanys Military Germanys armed forces are currently in a sorry state. Foreign missions that would require combat operations are out of the question. The troops reputation in their own country is practically non-existent, and allies know that German soldiers can, at best, be utilized for basic and routine services abroad. For the first time last year, the countrys leaders opened a serious discussion making the Bundeswehr fit to face the new challenges in the world, but the majority of the population still does not support the idea, and thus the grand coalition remains divided over the forces future. 168 Italys Election Day A Preview169 Italy will hold a series of elections and a constitutional referendum on 20-21 September. Leonardo Carella previews the votes and highlights some of the key things to watch out for when the results come through. On 20-21 September, Italians will head to the polls to vote for the presidency of seven regions, the mayoralty of over 1,100 municipalities, two Senate by-elections, and a constitutional referendum over the reduction of the number of MPs. The ballot, held over two days, comes as the first democratic test for the government following the Covid-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdown, which disrupted plans to hold some of these elections earlier this year. The massive election day has already given authorities headaches in terms of ensuring the safety of the procedures, as well as drawing criticism for using school facilities as polling places, cutting short what for many pupils will be the second week back in the classroom since March. The constitutional referendum is the only vote on which all the country will have a say. The proposal to reduce the number of MPs in the Chamber of Deputies from 630 to 400 and Senators from 315 to 200 is widely expected to pass, though with a low turnout and with little enthusiasm. The measure, sponsored by the largest government party, the Five-Star Movement M5S, has no real opponents outside of a few very vocal Twitter accounts parties of the right have expressed lukewarm support for it, while the centre-left junior coalition partner, the Democratic Party PD, has remained neutral. The latest IPSOS poll, published on 4 September on Corriere della Sera has Yes at 71, with a turnout estimate of 52. Conversely, the national conversation has so far focused intensely on the regional elections in Campania, Liguria, Marche, Apulia, Toscana, Valle dAosta and Veneto. These votes are a big deal regions have extensive powers on key policy areas like healthcare, infrastructure, agriculture and education, and the seven that will vote make up more than a third of Italys population. Moreover, regional presidents have been some of the most visible policy-makers during the coronavirus crisis, and it is expected that their performance will weigh heavily on voters decisions alongside judgements of the national response. Figure 1 Current polling for the upcoming regional elections Note Compiled by the author. But ultimately regional elections always have a strong national political significance. The electoral system, which returns a clear winner with a guaranteed majority, encourages voters and commentators to think of regional contests in party political terms, as high-stakes horse races. In short, voters cast two ballots one for a coalition of parties supporting a candidate for the presidency and one for an individual party. The highest-polling coalition gets the presidency, 80 of seats in the regional council are attributed proportionally according to party votes, plus a 20 top-up that ensures that the winning coalition holds a majority in the council. If regional elections are a thermometer of national party standings, Italy is in the grip of a right-wing fever. Since the last general election, the coalition of the right  headed by radical right parties Lega and Brothers of Italy FdI, plus Silvio Berlusconis Forza Italia FI  snatched the presidency from PD in eight out of nine regional races, with the M5S trailing the two main coalitions by miles in virtually every election and plummeting into single-digits in the last two. Figure 2 Presidential coalitions in Italian regions Note Compiled by the author. Although regional election polls in Italy are notoriously unreliable, this time around the left can be reasonably confident of holding onto the presidency of Campania. The southern region is not historically their home turf, but here the PD can count on an unlikely saviour incumbent regional president Vincenzo De Luca. A colourful character with a dozen court cases to his name and ostensibly a relic of the reviled partitocrazia of old  he became secretary of Salerno provinces Communist Party chapter in 1975  De Luca is wildly popular in his home region. Much of De Lucas appeal is due to his sheriff-like handling of the response to the coronavirus, which saw footage of him threatening to send police to stop unauthorised gatherings with flamethrowers go viral on social media. Yet his unconventional style seems to have worked Naples province has 3 million people and is one of the most high-density areas in Europe, but it only registered 4,000 Covid-19 cases. And the polls are clear that the meme president is comfortably leading his main rival, former regional president Stefano Caldoro FI, by over 20 points Winpoll, 27 August. Campania President De Luca, armed with a flamethrower, features as the main character in an arcade-style online game where he incinerates university graduates wishing to celebrate unauthorised and potentially infectious graduation parties. Holding onto the presidency of Marche is poised to be a much harder task for the lefts coalition. Though sometimes considered part of the Red Belt in Central Italy, Marche is one of the regions where Lega has made the most inroads since it expanded its appeal beyond the North, and was the epicentre of anti-migrant violence in the run-up to the 2018 election. The PD incumbent is stepping down, and the right is supporting a Brothers of Italy candidate, Francesco Acquaroli. The polls have Acquaroli ahead by somewhere between eight Istituto Noto, 25 June and fifteen percentage points Winpoll, 25-27 August. All in all, the race seems to be a re-run of the rights triumph of last October in Umbria a mid-income former left-wing heartland peppered with small towns, politically and demographically very similar to Marche. Matteo Salvini and Giorgia Melonis new right has been more successful than its Berlusconi-led predecessor in winning over areas like these  often building, as argued in a recent working paper by Moreno Mancosu and Riccardo Ladini, on a pre-existing far-right minority political culture in the Red Belt. Figure 3 Change in support for Lega in Italian regions Note Compiled by the author. The presidency of Tuscany, however, would be the rights most highly prized target wealthier, more urban and more left-leaning than Marche, former PM Matteo Renzis home region has been ruled by left-wing administrations for all 50 years of its existence. But this time, Legas candidate, Susanna Ceccardi, has a genuine shot at breaking the streak. Earlier this summer, polls had the lefts candidate and current speaker of the regional council, Eugenio Giani, leading Ceccardi by three to six points, but a poll published by Winpoll on 1 September had the gap down to just half a percentage point. The possibility of a run-off  Tuscanys twist on regional election rules requires a second round if no coalition reaches 40 of the vote  seems unlikely at this point, as the left and right have largely squeezed the M5Ss vote. It is hard to overstate how shocking it would be for Tuscany to fall to the right, and even a narrow victory for the left shouldnt be of much comfort to the PD and its allies. However, the precedent of Emilia-Romagna, another core Red Belt region that had its election in January this year, suggests caution there, some polls even had the right slightly ahead, but the left won by seven points on election day. A similar result in neighbouring Tuscany, with Giani and the left eking it out in the end, is still the most likely outcome. Alongside Tuscany, the other close regional election is in Apulia, where incumbent Michele Emiliano faces MEP Raffaele Fitto FdI, freshly acquitted of corruption charges related to his tenure as president of Apulia between 2000 and 2005. In this case, the left has been working pretty hard at self-sabotage. Emiliano, a former member of the PD now running as an independent, has alienated the centrist components of the lefts coalition Renzis Italia Viva and liberal Europa, who are running their own candidate against him. At the same time, while Emiliano is close to the M5S on many issues  his opposition to the TAP pipeline, his support for judicial activism and crucially his burning hatred of Matteo Renzi  attempts to form a joint list with the M5S fell through. The latest opinion polls have Emiliano trailing Fitto by one Winpoll, 3 September to six points EMG, 11 August, though Emiliano came slightly ahead of his rival in other polls earlier this summer. In sum, the race is wide open. Much will be determined by the decisions of M5S voters M5S candidate Antonella Laricchia is still projected to win around 15 of the vote, but the left will be aiming to capture some of that vote as it becomes clearer Laricchia doesnt have a real shot to the presidency. Only in Liguria, the slender strip of land that stretches across the northwestern shore of Italy, have the PD and M5S agreed to run a joint candidate, after M5S members gave their seal of approval to pre-electoral alliances in an online vote. The alliance, however, is unlikely to make a difference Liguria seems safely in the bag for the right. Incumbent president Giovanni Toti, a close ally of Berlusconi who had at one point been anointed as his presumptive political heir, is polling at 60 Winpoll, 28 August, 25 points ahead of Ferruccio Sansa, the joint PD-M5S candidate. An even more lopsided victory for the right is to be expected in Veneto. Not only is the wealthy North-Eastern region a traditional reservoir of votes for Lega, but the incumbent president Luca Zaia Lega is the most popular regional administrator in the country, even ahead of De Luca and his flamethrowers. Again, performance during the coronavirus outbreak seems to have been decisive Zaias early and extensive testing initiatives have been widely credited with stopping a Lombardy-like outbreak in its tracks. Zaia, the most prominent of Legas old guard of northern autonomists who are queasy about Salvinis turn to Italian nationalism, is projected to win over 70 of the vote in Veneto Winpoll, 20 August, with some even suggesting a record-breaking 80 Fabbrica Politica, 7 August. The real question here is just how much political capital Zaia has  and, in the medium-to-long term, how he wants to use it in the eventuality that Salvinis leadership of Lega starts to flounder. Figure 4 National polling August 2019 to August 2020 Note Compiled by the author. Tiny Valle DAosta is something of a standalone case the French-speaking region has its own party system dominated by regionalist parties and its own proportional electoral rules, which do not entail direct election of the regional president. The election wasnt even supposed to happen this year. After the last vote in 2018, a Lega president was elected the first one from a national party rather than a regionalist one in 70 years. But the administration collapsed within a year, and the regionalists formed a caretaker administration in 2019. In the meantime, the region was rocked by a corruption scandal over links between politics and the Calabrian mafia attentive readers might have spotted that this is something of a theme in Italian regional politics. We dont have any poll to go by, and Valle dAostas regional politics is very idiosyncratic, so theres little to be said about it with certainty. Lega has been on its way up there, while the regionalists have been affected the most by the mafia scandals, so a strong performance by the right is to be expected. At the same time, the PD will be looking to get back into the regional council, as the party did not clear the threshold in the 2018 election. The regional presidency will be a matter of jockeying in the council, so it may not be known for some time after the election. What to look out for on election night Its easy to get lost in the fractured landscape of Italian regional politics. So heres a quick round-up of what to keep an eye on when the results come through to help you bluff your way through election night a.. The winning coalition in Apulia and Tuscany. Assuming that the right has three regions in the bag Veneto, Liguria and Marche and the left has one Campania, a few votes in the two closest elections can make the difference between a final tally of 3-3 narrative the PD is alive and kicking and a thumping 5-1 win for the right narrative landslide for Salvini, government in disarray. b.. The performance of the M5S-PD alliance in Liguria. The parties are shackled in an uneasy coalition at national level, but they must be aware by now that they must come to some sort of arrangement if they wish to stem the right-wing tide. If the M5S-PD joint list in Liguria flops as it did in Umbria last year, will prospects of a full-fledged alliance recede for the foreseeable future? c.. The overall performance of the M5S. The party has underperformed badly at local level, squeezed by the left and the right alike, and its now polling around the 10 mark in most regional races. Can Prime Minister Giuseppe Contes uptick in popularity help M5S candidates, or has support for the M5S become essentially a personal vote for Conte? d.. The size of Zaias victory in Veneto. How much political capital does Zaia have, and how will he decide to wield it? e.. The balance of power within the Rights coalition. The individual party vote tally will also allow us to take stock of one of the most significant and underappreciated trends of the last year the ascent of Brothers of Italy at the expense of Lega. To what extent is Giorgia Meloni a serious threat to Salvinis leadership of the right?170 Key Architect of Hungarys Pro-Family Policies Katalin Novak Promoted to Ministerial Position171 A key architect in Hungarys attempt to increase its countrys birth rate, Hungarian State Secretary for Family Affairs Katalin Novak, has been promoted to the rank of minister without portfolio, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Saturday in an interview with national television channel M1. We are creating a position of minister without portfolio for family affairs, Orban said. There is no one else more suited for this position than Katalin Novak, who has been working as state secretary for family and youth affairs since 2014. The Hungarian population had been steadily declining since 1981, so Prime Minister Viktor Orbans government decided in 2010 to build a family-friendly country where young people about to have children and families with children are a priority.172 Poland Cringe Liberal Warsaw Mayor Trzaskowski Demands Nightclub DJ Change the Music, Says, Its My City.173 A video recording showing liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski demanding that a DJ changes the music at a nightclub has produced an avalanche of comments and criticism in the Polish press and on social media. The former Civic Platforms candidate for Polish president was attending a birthday party of one of his friends, which was organized in a fashionable club on the banks of the Vistula river. At around 1 a.m. all eyes at the club were focused on Trzaskowski as he attempted to intervene with the DJs about the music they were playing.

Using the Governments own figures, he shows that deaths from covid-19 have been falling for weeks, while extra deaths due to the lockdowns and hospital closures are more than ten times as numerous as covid-19 deaths. Dr Coleman also explains how it is possible that serious side effects associated with the Astra Zeneca vaccine could result in 450,000 healthy people becoming permanently paralysed.

The information was accessible to any individual for at least 20 hours before it was removed. Public Health Wales itself provided the information on what happened. The agency indicated that the personal data of more than 18,000 people affected by COVID-19 were erroneously uploaded to a public access database for more than 20 hours. Among the data included are the sex, geographic area, and date of birth of individuals.188 Your Government Wants You Dead189 by Dr Vernon Coleman MB ChB DSc FRSA I find it impossible to believe that administrators around the world all made the same terrible mistake in sending hospital patients into care homes. No, there has been a coordinated, massive extermination programme. The only logical conclusion is that thousands of old people around the world have been murdered. As a result, governments around the world have saved themselves billions in long-term health costs. And those same governments will also save themselves billions of pounds a year because of the pensions they wont have to pay. By sending elderly people with the coronavirus into care homes, the health care officials were sending them in as Trojan Horse killers. And it has been a holocaust. Incidentally, the dictionary defines a holocaust as slaughter on a mass scale. And I cannot think of a more appropriate word because that is what this has been.

RIPJKRowling Trends Ahead of Release of Mystery Novel Featuring Transvestite Serial Killer251 JK Rowlings latest book, written under pseudonym Robert Galbraith, includes a male serial killer who dresses as a woman to murder his female victims. Trans advocates, already out for Rowlings blood, killed her via hashtag. After the Telegraph described Troubled Blood, the fifth installment in Rowlings mystery series, as a book whose moral seems to be never trust a man in a dress in its Sunday review, it was perhaps inevitable that her detractors would latch onto the novels plot as proof of her alleged transphobia  despite not having read it. The book, set for release on Tuesday, centers on a cold case investigation where the victim  a female doctor  is believed to have been killed by a man who dresses up as a woman in order to kill other women. While the killer isnt actually transgender, that didnt stop Pink News  an LGBT-focused UK outlet  from hyperventilating that it was the second time in the series Rowling had portrayed a trans character negatively, after its second installment depicted a trans-woman as unstable and aggressive.252 Is There Life Floating in the Clouds of Venus?253 Its an extraordinary possibility  the idea that living organisms are floating in the clouds of Planet Venus. But this is what astronomers are now considering after detecting a gas in the atmosphere they cant explain. That gas is phosphine  a molecule made up of one phosphorus atom and three hydrogen atoms. On Earth, phosphine is associated with life, with microbes living in the guts of animals like penguins, or in oxygen-poor environments such as swamps. For sure, you can make it industrially, but there are no factories on Venus and there are certainly no penguins.254 Scientists Discover Possible Sign of Life on Venus255 Scientists revealed that traces of a gas in the clouds of Venus could indicate some form of life on the planet, according to a new study made public on Monday. The study, which was published in the journal Nature Astronomy, reported the presence of phosphine  a toxic gas produced by some microbes that live in animal intestines on Earth  in the Venusian atmosphere.256 Strange Chemical in Clouds of Venus Defies Explanation.

baltimore,Cities across the US have torn down these controversial Confederate monuments,2018-02-17T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,The Baltimore Sun,"Since the Charlottesville incident, more than two dozen cities have removed Civil War-era monuments from plazas, parks, and government buildings or are considering such proposals. Officials from these cities argue that Confederate iconography encourages a revisionist history of the Civil War, during which Confederate statesfought2 forthe right to maintain slavery. The movement to rid streets of these monuments may be just starting. Here are 9 cities that have already done away with them. Annapolis, Maryland Eric BaradatAgence France-PresseGetty ImagesThe Confederate figure Roger Taney, a Supreme Court Justice who passed the 1857 Dred Scott Decision, which ruled that black Americans should not be considered American citizens. What happenedIn August, Republican Gov. Larry Hogan called for the removal3 of a statue of Taneys statue, which was located on a perch in front of the State House, according to The Baltimore Sun. Future plans The eventual home of the monument, now sitting in storage, is uncertain.New York, New York Bebeto MatthewsAPThe Confederate figures Confederate GeneralsRobert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson. What happened In August, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced4 a review of all symbols of hate on city property. A closed Episcopal church soon removed5 two plaques honoring Lee, and Bronx Community College took down busts of Lee and Jackson. Future plans Several more memorials remain, including a number of street names that pay tribute to the Confederacy. As The New Yorker notes6, it can be hard to get rid of Confederate monuments in the city if they are on private property. There are also powerful organizations, like the United Daughters of the Confederacy, that lobby to preserve them.Durham, North Carolina Getty ImagesThe Confederate figures Confederate General Robert E.

baltimore,The Police Killed Him,2015-04-20T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,The Baltimore Sun,"So notes Ta-Nehisi Coates in The Atlantic 1in a piece in mid-April, commenting on the already 100s of killings by police in 2015. Update New day, new police killing See Sherman, Kaltenbach and Campbell, the Baltimore Sun2 with video What we know is that while in police custody for committing no crime for which they had no justification for making the arrest except he was a black man running his spine was virtually severed, 80 percent severed, in the neck area, attorney Murphy said. He called Freddie Grays injuries catastrophic. Cops broke a 25-year-old mans spine virtually into two, he was killed.Madison police chief Mike Koval ought to consider what police killing is the next time Koval opens his mouth.Asks Coates In this time of heightened concern around the policing, a more essential question might be, Were we justified in sending them? At some point, Americans decided that the best answer to every social ill lay in the power of the criminal-justice system. Vexing social problems homelessness, drug use, the inability to support ones children, mental illness are presently solved by sending in men and women who specialize in inspiring fear and ensuring compliance. Fear and compliance have their place, but it cant be every place.I would not look to police for answers. As an institution, police tend to be anti-intellectual, careerist and authoritarian in their psychology. And duplicitous and tribal.This is because police departments are self-selecting, attracting someone capable and inclined to kill people. This does NOT appear be lost on the folks who knew Tony Robinson.Unfortunately, for Madison this fact does escape the police chief branding himself as reformist, now openly attacking a protesting community objecting to the police killing Robinson3.  1  2 page1  3",homelessness
baltimore,Smelling Rats in Baltimore,2019-07-31T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,The Baltimore Sun,"Why is the president a racist for pointing out what even African-American leaders in Baltimore have said about certain areas of the city? The Washington Times resurrected a comment by former Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh, who is African-American and was ousted from office over an investigation into corruption. Pugh commented on part of the citys abandoned row houses and alleys strewn with trash Whoa, you can smell the rats. Whew, Jesus. Oh, my God, you can smell the dead animals. In 2015, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., toured West Baltimore as a presidential candidate in the company of African-American leaders and residents. The Baltimore Sun reported this statement by Sanders Anyone who took the walk that we took around this neighborhood would not think youre in a wealthy nation. You would think that you were in a Third World country. Those with him nodded approvingly. Are Pugh and Sanders racists for stating the obvious? Baltimore has averaged 300 murders per year for several years. In 2015, it set a record with 344 homicides, according to the Sun. The newspaper, which has been highly critical of Trumps remarks about Cummings, reported last September on FBI statistics that it said showed Baltimore had the worst homicide rate among the nations 50 largest cities last year and the second-highest violent crime rate overall. Is it racist to point that out, or is it only racist when a white politician says it? Instead of listening to politicians talk about Baltimore, elected officials and the media should be talking to people who have been trapped in these squalid areas. They might ask Democrats who have run the city and other cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Detroit, and Flint, Michigan where homelessness, crime and filth abound why they have done nothing to improve these neighborhoods. Many American cities with similar problems have been run by Democrats for decades. Why do voters keep returning them to office when their misery only deepens? What would Democrats do if the poor and minority voters, who are their base, tried a different party and a different attitude? Democrats have promised much and delivered little to their base, at least since the 1930s when the federal government began to dispense welfare benefits, benefits that have fueled an addiction to entitlement programs and created an allegiance to the party most dedicated to keeping the checks coming in exchange for votes. Democrats such as Cummings have also opposed school choice. The ability to choose a better public, or private school for poor and minority children with vouchers to pay for them is an opportunity to improve their prospects and break out of the poverty cycle that for some families has been repeated for several generations. Kimberly Klacik, who occasionally appears on Fox News Channel, says she is a journalist and lives in Baltimore. She interviewed a local African-American woman named Michelle, who said What President Trump said was definitely true. Cummings hasnt done anything for us. Hes worried more about caring for illegal aliens at the border than his own people. Trump is not racist Im glad he put Cummings on blast. The rats just didnt come. These houses just didnt get torn down, theyve been like this.Given these facts, to whom should the racist label be more accurately applied? c 2019 Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

Clinton reached out through Lanny Davis, who served as a Clinton adviser during the Monica Lewinsky scandal and now acts as a crisis communications advisor to those with image problems, to contact Micheletti. Davis was employed to work on behalf of the post-coup Honduran government, according to Bill Conroy at Narco News.ltnlgt The U.S. government did its best to support the ouster of Zelaya. It blocked a resolution by the Organization of American States that would have required Zelayas return as a pre-condition for staging an election.

In the run-up to the vote, there was violence against anti-coup organizers and opposition rallies. The pro-coup faction won the election with many opposition candidates boycotting the contest.

Those with a family learn to resolve an equation that not even great mathematicians know how to solve  how to make 24 hours become double.ltnlgt There are mums and dads who could win the Nobel prize, Francis quipped.ltnlgt I dont know how they do it, but they get on with it and they do.

Do we have the Gospel in our home? Do we open it from time to time? Do we meditate on it together with reciting the rosary? Christians most common complaint regards their time, the pope said, I ought to pray more  but often I have no time. We here this continuously. The displeasure is sincere, certainly, because the human heart is always searching for prayer, and if it doesnt find it has no peace. For them to meet, one has to cultivate in the heart a warm love for God, an affectionate love, the pope said.ltnlgtltnlgt Spain Becomes Nation of Stoners as Popularity of Cannabis Clubs Soars126ltnlgt Spain has overtaken the Netherlands as a marijuana smoking nation and is third in the world behind Iceland and the United States, new data shows.ltnlgtltnlgt Spain Fury as Archaeological Site Ruined and Replaced With Picnic Table127ltnlgt Builders in a Galician village confused a neolithic tomb with a broken stone picnic table and replaced the 6,000-year-old artefact with a brand spanking new concrete bench.ltnlgtltnlgt Thousands Flock to La Tomatina for Spains Epic Tomato Throwing Battle128ltnlgt Thousands of half-naked revellers pelted each other with tomatoes on Wednesday in the town of Buñol in eastern Spain, bathing the streets with red goo in the 70th annual Tomatina battle.ltnlgtltnlgt Tolkiens First, Undeniably Darkest Prose to be Published129ltnlgt The first prose piece by Lord of the Rings author J.R.R.

Some analysts have warned of the dangers of a caste war if the tensions are not eased.ltnlgtltnlgt Indian Anti-Corruption Official State Orchestrated Islamist Terror147ltnlgt Mumbai atrocities enabled by intelligence operations of India, Pakistan and the United Statesltnlgt A senior Indian police officer and anti-corruption investigator last month accused the Indian government of orchestrating the Mumbai terror attacks which occurred nearly seven years ago, according to an Indian government official.ltnlgt R. V. S. Mani, a former undersecretary in Indias home ministry now in the urban development ministry, testified in July that a senior police officer who investigated the 2004 encounter killings of four Indian Muslims in Gujarat by the Ahmedabad Police Crime Branch, had told him that the 2008 Mumbai attacks were set up by the Indian government.ltnlgt The police officer, Satish Verma  currently Principal at the Police Training College in Junagadh  is well-known for his secondment to the Central Bureau of Investigation CBI, Indias elite anti-corruption law enforcement agency, to lead the probe into the 2004 encounter killings.ltnlgt The 2004 victims were Ishrat Jahan Raza, a 19-year-old girl from Mumbra, Maharashtra, and three men  Pranesh Pillai alias Javed Gulam Sheikh, Amjad Ali Rana and Zeeshan Johar. Gujarat police authorities with the support of Indian government officials claimed that the killings were justified due to credible intelligence linking the four to Islamist terrorists.ltnlgt Anti-corruption investigator blames government for terrorltnlgt According to Mani, who has signed affidavits submitted to court on the encounter killings, Satish Verma privately accused successive Indian governments of orchestrating not only the Mumbai terror attacks, but also the December 2001 terrorist attack on the Indian Parliament in New Delhi.ltnlgt Verma made the allegations while questioning Mani on Indian government claims that intelligence proved Ishrat Jahans links to Islamist terrorists. According to the Times of India, the former home ministry official revealed in his affidavits that Verma had said the terror attacks were set up by the government with the objective of strengthening the counter-terror legislation.ltnlgtltnlgt Men in Afghan Uniforms Kill 2 American NATO Soldiers in Base Attack148ltnlgt Two men wearing Afghan National Defense and Security Force uniforms opened fire Wednesday inside a military base in southern Afghanistan, killing two US NATO service members before being shot dead themselves, the international force said.ltnlgt At the Pentagon Wednesday, Captain Jeff Davis told reporters he would not release their names or service citing notifications of next of kin and a 24 hour waiting period.ltnlgtltnlgt Renewed Clashes in Nepal Over New Constitution149ltnlgt Police clashed with more than a hundred demonstrators in the town of Gau on Tuesday as neighbor India called for calm. One person was killed, a day after the violence claimed nine lives.ltnlgt Tensions escalated after members of parliament struck a deal on a new constitution, which was meant to cement peace after a 10-year insurgency led by former Maoist rebels. Progress was hastened following Nepals devastating earthquake in April this year.ltnlgt The plans would see the country divided into seven provinces, which critics say would limit their political representation.ltnlgtltnlgt Off the Grid North Korean Sub Fleets Mystery Mission150ltnlgt Two-thirds of North Koreas submarine fleet was reportedly on the move and off of Seouls sonar this week despite an announcement by the two Koreas that they were ratcheting down the saber rattling that followed a land mine explosion in the demilitarized zone earlier this month.ltnlgtltnlgt Vietnam Seizes Illegal Ivory From Malaysia151ltnlgt Customs officials in Vietnam have confiscated illegally imported ivory for the second time in two weeks.

Greece may have to face an EU fine over the failure, the same source said.ltnlgt During a visit to the Former YugoslavRepublic of Macedonia FYROM, Austrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz called for coordinated action across Europe while urging Greece to control its borders more effectively. Its also the fault of Greece if there is no support for the refugees there, the Austrian said.ltnlgtltnlgt Belgium At Least 100 Asylum Seekers Spend the Night on the Street156ltnlgt The refugee crisis is continuing. As the Belgian Immigration Office in Brussels cant cope with the long queues of refugees wanting to file an asylum application, dozens of people have to be refused each day. As a result, various persons have to spend the night on the street, without shelter. The Red Cross prepared some soup and food, while passers-by gave the homeless apples and blankets.ltnlgt Asylum seekers that have just arrived in Belgium, have to register at the Immigration Office first. Its the very first step in their procedure to get a residence permit. When they have registered, they are giving shelter via the Asylum Department Fedasil bed, bath and bread while their application procedure is running.ltnlgt The instream of asylum seekers has taken on such proportions that civil servants at the Immigration Office cant cope. Each day, dozens of asylum seekers have to be refused despite waiting for hours. Those that cant be helped, are given a piece of paper  in Dutch, a language which none of the asylum seekers understands  that gives them priority for the next day when the doors of the Immigration Office near the North station reopen. Its mainly these people that were spending the night on the street, or in a nearby park.ltnlgtltnlgt Czech Republic Advocates Use of Army to Protect Borders157ltnlgt The EU could better protect itself from migrants if it had a common army, Czech president Milos Zeman said Tuesday 25 August, while the Czech finance minister, Andrej Babis, called for the closure of the Schengen areas external borders and for Nato help.ltnlgt Speaking to Czech ambassadors at Prague castle, Zeman regretted that Frontex, the EU border-control agency, has only three unarmed ships and a few armed ships to patrol the Mediterranean.ltnlgt The EUs fundamental lack is a lack of will for a common border protection, Zeman said.ltnlgt Today, a common European army would come in handy to address the issue, he added.ltnlgt Czech authorities recently floated the idea of using the army to secure the countrys borders.ltnlgtltnlgt Divided Europe Faces Mounting Migrant Crisis158ltnlgt Faced with its worst migrant crisis since World War II, Europe has many sensible options to deal with people fleeing conflict in Syria and elsewhere  but cant agree on any of them.ltnlgt The situation has accelerated over the summer with a new stream of migrants arriving via the Balkans, adding to those braving death to cross the Mediterranean or risking their lives to enter the Channel Tunnel.ltnlgt Efforts to redistribute refugees around the European Union have been hobbled by a lack of unity among governments running scared of right-wing populist parties.ltnlgt Meanwhile, measures to stop the flow of asylum seekers at its source in the Middle East and North Africa have stalled because the turbulence in the region means Brussels has no stable governments it can deal with.ltnlgt With no solution in sight, European countries are now resorting to desperate measures to keep out equally desperate migrants, such as a huge razor fence that Hungary is erecting on its Serbian border.ltnlgt Officials and experts say EU states need to act quickly before the situation becomes uncontrollable, with no end in sight to the wars and political repression that are making the migrants flee.ltnlgtltnlgt Donald Trump Goes Head to Head With Univision Reporter on Immigration159ltnlgt Presidential candidate Donald Trump had Univision reporter Jorge Ramos temporarily removed from an Iowa press conference Tuesday after the journalist unexpectedly stood up and began demanding answers on the Republican frontrunners proposed immigration policy.ltnlgt Ramos, who peppered the business mogul with questions as soon as he reached the podium, refused to sit down as Trump attempted to call on other reporters.ltnlgt Sit down, Trump said repeatedly. Excuse me, sit down. You werent called.ltnlgt After being told to go back to Univision, Ramos was physically removed from the room by what appeared to be a member of Trumps staff.ltnlgt The reporter, who was eventually allowed back in the room and permitted to ask his question, argued that it would be impossible to deport millions of illegal immigrants and to build a wall on the countrys Southern border.ltnlgtltnlgt EU to Give 1.5mn to Serbia and Macedonia160ltnlgt The European Commission announced Wednesday the release of 1.5 million in humanitarian funds to help Serbia and Macedonia face massive arrivals of migrants.

The release reflected Israels ongoing struggles in coping with an influx of African migrants that it does not want in the country, but is unable to forcibly send anywhere else.ltnlgt More than 45,000 African migrants and asylum seekers are in Israel, according to the Israeli Interior Ministry, most from the strife-ridden countries of Eritrea and Sudan.ltnlgtltnlgt Italy Rebukes Merkel on Migration Remarks167ltnlgt Italys foreign minister Gentiloni rebuked comments made Monday by German chancellor Merkel that Rome is slow in setting up registration centres for newly-arrived migrants.

This text differs in minor ways from the Washington Times version.ltnlgt According to the most recent poll, the innocuously-named but ferociously anti-establishment Sweden Democrats Sverigedemokraterna or SD has the largest support of any political party in Sweden. This news has potentially momentous implications not just for Sweden but for all Europe.ltnlgt Sweden is a special place. One of the richest and most peaceful countries in the world it has not been engaged in armed conflict for two centuries, until recently it was a remarkably homogenous society where socialism, with its optimistic assumption that people are born good and circumstances make them bad, worked and the government enjoyed great prestige. Swedish pride in the countrys accomplishments translates into an ethical superiority symbolized by the oft-heard claim to be a moral superpower.ltnlgt This heritage has also inspired an intolerance of dissent, however Be quiet, follow the consensus, let the bureaucrats carry it out. The country has become so notorious for its stifling faux-unanimity that I actually heard a Dane recently ask at a public forum, Why has Sweden turned into the North Korea of Scandinavia?ltnlgt Also, Swedens history creates a no-crisis mentality that militates against the hard-headed, flexible responses needed to cope with current problems the country now faces, especially those connected to waves of mainly Muslim immigrants. As one interlocutor put it to me in Stockholm earlier this month, Past success has led to current failure. For example, security in Sweden is well below what might find in a country like Bolivia, with few inclinations to make improvements, rendering Islamist violence all but inevitable.ltnlgt In this stultification, the SD stands out because it offers the only political alternative. Proof of this came in December 2014, when the SD appeared to have the swing vote in a crucial budget vote between the left and right blocs in the countrys unicameral legislature, the Riksdag  until all the other seven parties joined together in a grand coalition to deny it any influence.ltnlgt As this act of desperation suggests, the Sweden Democrats offer a populist  and not, as usually described, a far right  brew of policies anathema to all the legacy parties Foremost, it calls for assimilating legal immigrants, expelling the illegals, and reducing future immigration by at least 90 percent. It also forwards a number of other policies concerning crime, defense, the European Union, and Israel far outside the Swedish consensus and utterly obnoxious to the other parties.ltnlgt With good reason, the establishment hates and fears the SD, pedantically finding any possible fault with the party, starting with its alleged neo-fascist past though fascist connections are not unique to SD and going on to the tiniest foibles of its leadership.ltnlgt Supporting the SD remains taboo. The national police commissioner once tweeted about vomiting on seeing the SDs leader naturally, his staff dare not acknowledge their supporting for the party. But one officer estimated for me that 50 percent of the police vote SD.ltnlgt Despite being ostracized, the SD increasingly connects with Swedes including some immigrants, giving it substantial electoral gains, roughly doubling its parliamentary vote every four years from 0.4 percent in 1998 to 1.3 percent in 2002, 2.9 percent in 2006, 5.7 percent in 2010, and 12.9 percent in September 2014. And now, less than a year later, a YouGov poll shows it having nearly doubled again, to 25.2 percent, meaning that it leads the governing Social Democrats who have only 23.4 percent support and the major nominally right-wing party, the Moderates with 21 percent.ltnlgt No less important, I learned in Stockholm, the intellectual and political climate has shifted. Journalists, policy specialists, and politicians all noted that ideas outside the mainstream just a year ago now receive a hearing. For example, four major newspapers have questioned the consensus in favor of high immigration. Beside the surging SD vote, this shift results from several factors the shocking rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria ISIS, which has altered the debate continued upset at the December compact that excluded the SD from having its due parliamentary influence and the receding memory of Anders Behring Breiviks 2011 murderous rampage in Norway.ltnlgt In all, it appears that denial and censorship can only continue for so long before the instinct of self-preservation kicks in. The Western country most prone to national suicide is possibly waking up from its stupor. If this change can take place in Sweden, the North Korea of Scandinavia, it can, and likely will, occur elsewhere in Europe.ltnlgt This text may be reposted or forwarded so long as it is presented as an integral whole with complete and accurate information provided about its author, date, place of publication, and original URL.ltnlgtltnlgt The Wave Has Reached Us EU Gropes for Answers to Migrant Surge174ltnlgt A surge in migrants, many of them refugees from Syria, hit Hungarys southern border on Tuesday, passing through gaps in an unfinished barrier to a Europe groping for answers to its worst refugee crisis since World War Two.ltnlgt Nearing the end of a flight from war and poverty, they walked around or over coils of barbed wire strung out along Hungarys 175-km 109-mile frontier with Serbia, children hoisted on shoulders, bags in hand.ltnlgt The wave has definitely reached us now, said Mark Kekesi, head of a migration NGO called MigSzol Szeged.

baltimore,PART 2: Working in Columbia: Its Downtown and Business Parks Went Up and Down With The Economy,2016-08-21T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,The Baltimore Sun,"Baseball cap says Ryland Celebrates Rouse. Photo by Len Lazarick The baseball caps handed out that day said Ryland Celebrates Rouse, and on the back there was the cryptic embroidery 5K125M. It meant 5,000 homes, a quarter of Columbias single family and townhouses, and 125 million in land sales. While the two companies were described as partners, the relationship was really that of buyer and seller. Using the raw land it purchased in the 1960s, The Rouse Co. sold developed lots to Ryland, and Ryland then built houses on the lots to sell to homebuyers -- and did it quickly and cheaply. Not too many companies have these kinds of relationships, said Chad Drier, Ryland chairman, president and CEO. The Cost of the Land The relationship illustrates a key financial aspect of the entire Columbia project Buy undeveloped farmland at low prices, improve it with streets, water, sewer, shops and amenities, and sell it for many times its original cost. Buy low sell high. At the celebration, there was some gentle ribbing on both sides about the most constant source of friction in the relationship the price of land. We dont charge as much for the lots as we should, joked a Rouse executive. In 1967, the first nine lots Ryland bought from Rouse cost 45,900 or 5,100 apiece. Thirty-five years later, residential lots were going for 20 times that amount or more. This building at Little Patuxent and Broken Land parkways once was the Ryland headquarters. Now it houses the Enterprise Foundation that James Rouse set up to support affordable housing projects. Photo by Len Lazarick Yet among the ironies of the 2001 event was that Ryland, now a publicly traded company, had abandoned its attractive headquarters in downtown Columbia the year before and hustled off to California, Dreiers home state. The departure from the planned community where the homebuilding giant grew up had disappointed Rouse and Howard County officials, but no one brought it up at a celebration geared toward happy recollections. By that time, the Rouse Co. was about done selling building lots to single-family homebuilders. Not far from the Clarksville ballroom was the last of a dozen model home parks, where Ryland and other builders, some of them home-grown but smaller, had displayed their wares. Three-and-a-half years after the celebration, Rouse itself would disappear from downtown Columbia in a 12 billion sale to General Growth Properties GGP, one of the biggest U.S. real estate deals ever recorded. The two companies that created Columbia were among the dozens of companies that have come and gone over the years. But unlike the tech companies that have merged or evaporated, Ryland and Rouse left behind permanent structures in which people live and work, like the 1973 Ryland Valencia model in which this essay is being written. During their time, the two publicly traded companies were a visible corporate presence in Columbia, with executives and their spouses serving on nonprofit and community boards. The companies were generous financial supporters of community causes. Shelter and Jobs While Jim Rouse preached his grand social vision of a garden for growing people, those people needed shelter and jobs, shops and services -- and the businesses that provided them. Those homes and workplaces were essential to the economic model that would make Columbia a viable enterprise. As noted in last months essay1, before Columbia, Howard County was largely a farming community with minimal employment outside of agriculture and retail. The smattering of residents in suburban developments mostly commuted into Baltimore, still a city of 900,000 people, 50 larger than it is today. There were only two major employment centers in the county -- The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab, a center for defense work where, much like today, few people knew what they did and the Route 1 corridor. Fifty years ago, and still today, APL is the largest private employer in Howard County, now with 5,000 employees, working mostly on federal research projects. Until Interstate 95 between the Washington and Baltimore beltways was fully completed in 1971, Route 1 was the major north-south route on the East Coast, and already looking seedy. Warehouses, junkyards and industrial operations were concentrated there, and just east were the freight railroad tracks that serve as the border between Howard and the neighboring Anne Arundel County, from which it was lopped off in 1851. Aside from Columbia shopping centers -- more on those next month -- the principal employment centers were to be in downtown Columbia and east of Route 29, ringing the edges of the new towns residential growth. With few people living there and the highways unfinished, Rouse itself built the first office buildings on the farmland that became downtown. It built a hotel there as well, before there was a market to support one, the low-slung Cross Keys Inn. The hotel later added the current tower, becoming the Columbia Inn, and then in 1998, Rouse finally unloaded the property to become the Sheraton it still is today. The company slowly added seven more office buildings over decades, but it saved the choicest spots until the population rose and increased the value of the land. The East Side For the east side of Columbia, the company followed the pattern of developing business sites for others to build on. The first business to build there was Hittman Associates, which at the time did environmental studies, later branching into medical and nuclear equipment. Fred Hittman chose Columbia because of its central location and because of a promised lifestyle that would make it easy to recruit highly educated workers. It was more of a dream place at that time, Hittman told the Baltimore Sun in a 1992 interview. But the promise for me was that this was a place that would attract and hold scientists and engineers. Hittman would become the first chair of the new Howard County Chamber of Commerce. It was a refrain that would echo through the decades from firms large and small about the decision to locate in Columbia. The first reason related to the time-honored real estate mantra of location, location, location, the central location that led Rouse to scarf up 14,000 acres of farmland. The second reason was the educated workforce, including a concentration of scientists and engineers. For decades, Columbia had more cachet than Howard County as a business address, said Dick Story, the countys economic development director from 1993 to 2006. He recounted the tale of a developer who wanted his new office buildings to have a Columbia address, despite its Ellicott City zip code. Go ahead and call it Columbia anyway, Story told him. A postal inspector told them to knock it off. General Electric In Then Out This aerial photo shows the existing water tower and Snowden River Parkway on the left, I-95 on the upper right, Snowdens intersection with Oakland Mills Road at the bottom, and General Electrics buildings in the middle. Photo for The Rouse Co. by WM. S. Pearson Jr. Courtesy of Columbia Archives. Hittmans modest industrial building was small potatoes compared to the major sale for the biggest parcel on the east side of Columbia to one of the worlds largest corporations, General Electric. Rouse sold 1,125 acres south of Route 175 between Snowden River Parkway and I-95 for what was to become the GE Appliance Park East. It was projected to employ more than 10,000 people, manufacturing and distributing appliances, similar to an existing appliance park in Louisville, Kentucky. Imagine how different the Columbia economy would be today if manufacturing had been its core industry. Ultimately, GE only built four mammoth buildings on a third of the site, and employment topped at 2,800 in 1974, when the company closed the air conditioner plant. Twelve years later, it shuttered the microwave oven plant as it began importing machines from Japan and Korea. It finally shut the range plant in 1990 as it acquired a more productive Georgia facility. The saga illustrates the vagaries of the economy and the fluctuating dynamics of individual industries that were constantly challenging the profitability of the Columbia project. From the time Rouse started acquiring land in 1962, there have been seven national recessions. The most devastating for Rouses Columbia project was the 1973-75 downturn that combined the Arab oil embargo, high inflation and high unemployment. Land sales plummeted and Howard Research and Development HRD -- the Rouse Co. division that was building Columbia -- would have gone bankrupt except for an infusion of cash from Connecticut General, original financier of Rouses entire Columbia project. The Rouse Co. bought back the two-thirds of the land that GE never used, and later, as GE pulled out, some of those buildings, as well. In the long run, while the 10,000 well-paid GE manufacturing and office workers never materialized, Rouse used the land to create Columbia Gateway, which eventually would include one of the largest concentrations of high tech businesses in the Baltimore-Washington corridor. By 1999, Gateway would become a hot location, but it was a long time coming, 30 years after GEs initial deal. The Hot Location As difficult as the 1970s recession had been for Rouses project, the 1990s recession was more severe for the Maryland economy because of the cutbacks in defense spending from the collapse of the Soviet Union ending the Cold War. As the commercial real estate market struggled to overcome this, as well as digest speculative overbuilding from the 1980s, HRD sold only one measly acre of land in Gateway -- for a parking lot. I aggressively sat by the phone, waiting for it to ring, recalled Ed Ely, HRD vice president for business land sales. The situation in Gateway was so dire that an empty glass-and-marble five-story office building was sold to the county government at a fire-sale price, becoming headquarters for several agencies, including the newly privatized Economic Development Corporation. Then along came Micros. The fast-growing company, founded by a graduate of Howard High School, supplied hardware and software to restaurants and hotels worldwide. Its 700 employees were scattered among several buildings in Beltsville. A few top executives already lived in Howard County, and we felt relocating there could help our technical recruiting efforts, its chief financial officer told me. In 1999, it put up the first Gateway office building visible from I-95. For a brief time from 1999 to 2001, Gateway and other Columbia locations were the epicenter of an explosion of fiber optics research, with Corvis the biggest player, employing 1,500 people at one point and raising 1 billion in its initial stock offering. Companies large and small were trying to capture a share of the photonics revolution, boosting communications and Internet speeds through fiber optic cables. The movement was so large that we at The Business Monthly produced a special section for a national engineering conference in Baltimore on fiber optics in 2001, featuring all two-dozen Maryland companies. Those that survived the end of the boomlet transformed themselves by merger or acquisition. Some simply went out of business. The Micros sign that graced its building for 14 years has been replaced by its new owner, Oracle, repeating the continual pattern where large high tech firms eat small tech firms. There are few large headquarters of home-grown businesses anymore. MedStar, the hospital conglomerate that has agreed to occupy the newest downtown Columbia structure going up at Little Patuxent and Broken Land, is an exception. Not only is the Micros sign gone, so is Arbitron, the once-thousand-strong audience monitoring firm for radio stations on Broken Land Parkway at Route 32. It was purchased by Nielsen, which now has a smaller presence here. The Flier building on Little Patuxent Parkway across from the community college, once the headquarters for a 13-paper chain of community newspapers, has stood vacant for years and is slated for affordable housing. Long-time community leaders note the loss in corporate presence here. The business community used to be very much involved in social issues here ... as corporate citizens, observed Pat Kennedy, president of the Columbia Association for 26 years. Now, there are a lot of corporate addresses and absentee ownership, noted Roger Caplan, head of the Caplan Group, an advertising and marketing firm. Not Like Columbia Whats even odder about this long run-down of the business underpinnings of Columbia and its role as a key employment center for the region is that Gateway may officially be part of Columbia, but by look and feel it and the other local business parks could be anywhere. Their landlords and tenants generate millions for the Columbia Association lien, but theres little sense that they are part of Columbia at all. The majority of employees in Gateway, or any Columbia business park, do not live in Columbia, much as the majority of Columbia residents do not work in the new town, as was the case from its earliest days. Only one out of five working Columbia residents has commuting times of 15 minutes or less, and close to half 45 have commuting times of 30 minutes or more. Living and working here, as I have been able to do for half my career, might have been the ideal, but it has never been true for the vast majority of residents. lives in Gateway, except for one long-term-stay hotel. There is no mixed use, and but a puny strip of retail. Larger office buildings have their own cafeterias, or at least delis. Even with 12,000 or more people working there, pedestrian traffic is nil. Even Gateways street names have none of the striking weirdness of Columbia residential cul-de-sacs, drawn from American literature. Instead, they are named for American inventors and scientists Robert Fulton, Samuel Morse, Alexander Bell, Benjamin Franklin, Lee Deforest. On any weekend, the surface parking lots that encircle the buildings are empty. There is still prime acreage for sale in Gateway, and while the focus of Columbias development has shifted to downtown, former County Executive Ken Ulman, who guided the renewed plan for the center of Columbia, said, Columbia Gateway has got to adapt as well. Laura Neuman, who succeeded Dick Story as Ulmans economic development director and later become Anne Arundel County executive, agreed that Gateway needs a mixed use development. People like to live where they work, Neuman said, recalling her experience as a top executive of Matrics Technology Systems on Stanford Boulevard in Columbia west of Gateway, where there was a bar in the building, a deli, a dry cleaner, and hotels and restaurants that the staff used nearby. A Familiar Setting The former Rouse Co. headquarters now a grocery store, with a health space on the lowest level. Photo by Len Lazarick The room on the top of the old Rouse Co. headquarters was as familiar to me as any in Columbia. The modern chandeliers with parallel panes of glass are gone, the air ducts exposed and the floor bare, but the balconies still overlook Lake Kittamaqundi. I have this visual memory of a late 1970s annual meeting of the Rouse Co. there, with top executives sitting at an elevated table, getting ready to start the meeting. One called out to me, a lowly business reporter for a weekly community paper, about a news brief that had run with the headline Rouse has bad quarter. Heck, it was just a rewrite of a press release, and maybe the headline did overblow the financial results, but whats the big deal? The big deal that I didnt realize till then was that in the days before the Internet put everything online, stock analysts would subscribe to dinky local publications where public companies operated, looking for clues and problems the companies would not freely disclose. The space once called the Kittamaqundi Room, and later the Spear Center, was long the scene of the annual party of The Columbia Foundation, where you were likely to see all the movers and shakers in town. It was the site of memorial services as well. This was also where General Growth Properties, the Rouse Co. successor, had unveiled some of the first illustrations of how Columbias downtown might look. Afterward, Pat Kennedy and I would briefly discuss my book idea, he suggesting I should write about Columbia as a lived experience, as I am doing in these installments. In this room last month, I sat among mostly old friends and acquaintances to get an update on the downtown plans that may, at long last, 36 years after the original target date for completion, accomplish the goal of Columbias downtown as a complete city, not just a better suburb, as Jim Rouse had said. Other people had their own memories of the room, now an unoccupied floor over the Whole Foods grocery. This is where I had my prom, said Howard County Executive Allan Kittleman, who graduated from nearby Atholton High School as Columbia was being built in the 1970s. The July 8 event was ostensibly to provide an update on the progress of the downtown plan to put the final touches on the remaining 391 acres of town center, already 10 years in the works and six years since its formal passage. That day, Kittleman introduced legislation moving forward the final elements of the plan. Success is not inevitable, he told an audience of about 150 invited guests, all previously involved in the planning. We need to jump start the plan. ... We need to make sure this happens before were all 95 years old. Health will occupy this new building being completed at Little Patuxent and Broken Land Parkways. Photo by Len Lazarick The key is to make the new Columbia core into a place to live, work and play, built around the towns first public structure, a revived Merriweather Post Pavilion, Kittleman said. Howard Hughes Corp., GGPs spin-off, is calling this area the Merriweather District. It combines apartments, retail, offices and public institutions in a walkable mix with a decidedly urban feel. Plans call for 6,400 residential units -- up 900 from the 2010 plan -- 4.3 million square feet of office space, 1.25 million square feet of retail and a 640-room hotel. Building a 21st-century city is one of the reasons I moved here from Baltimore County, said Howard County Council Chair Calvin Ball. Revitalization is the right word for what were doing here, and the enhanced center of culture and commerce already in the works is exactly what we need. His council colleague Mary Kay Sigaty, whose West Columbia district includes downtown, told the audience, If Columbia is only a great place to raise a family, what are we missing? How are we bringing young people into the community? Having lived here 44 years, I continue to wait for the promise to happen, Sigaty said. The cocktail hour reception was really a pep rally for the final implementation of the downtown plan. A key element, long planned but not much publicized, is a proposed 93 million tax increment financing, dubbed a TIF. It authorizes the county to float bonds based on the tax proceeds from future development to pay for infrastructure, in this case a 2,500-space parking garage designed to service Merriweather in the evenings and weekends, and office buildings during the day. When the county council began holding extended hearings on the proposals the following week, it became clear why supporters of the plan needed to be rallied. Speaker after speaker in two four-hour sessions decried the plans. Key sticking points are the TIF -- many called it a handout to the developer, a free ride -- and Council Member Jen Terrasas push to increase the amount of affordable housing from 10 to 15. That increase was favored even by some of those backing other elements of the plan. Too Dense, Too High, Too Many The densest part of the new development called the Merriweather District. Illustration by Howard Hughes Corp. Over and over, the council heard people say there were too many apartments, they would overload the schools, the hospital, the roads traffic would be terrible, like the mall at Christmas but year round. The proposed buildings were too high most of the residences are seven stories and the few tall office buildings are 14 stories. There would be too many people and too much density -- though the amount of greenery and trees shown on site maps and renderings is more than downtown Bethesda or Rockville. LaTonya Peters had moved her family to Columbia for the schools and pathways. Im very concerned with the urbanization. ... The density of this plan seems to have no limit. We wanted the suburban lifestyle. If we wanted a city, we had plenty of other choices, Peters said. That sort thinking runs counter to most of those who developed the downtown plan, like Ken Ulman, who devoted immense time and energy as county executive to enacting it. People want to live in cities, urban centers that are walk-able and bike-able, said Ulman, now an economic development consultant. You want the right mix. Whats the scale whats the mix? How tall should a building be? Ulman faced opposition all along the way. I dont begrudge peoples anxieties about change, Ulman said. But things change while youre fighting change. Weve had a great 50 years in Columbia, said Ulman, 42, born and raised in Columbia and now raising his own family here. There are a lot of places that used to be a great place to live, he said. Folks assumed we would be one of those places, but weve got to stay ahead of trends. Next month in Columbia at 50 Shopping, retailing, housing.

The ride-share driver, however, got out of his car armed with a gun and fired multiple rounds at the suspect after the suspect had gotten into the drivers seat of the ride-share drivers car, the PC statement says. The suspect had been shot in the leg, the ride-share driver told police. The suspect then got out of the car and ran back to the truck, speeding east on Buchtel Boulevard, according to the PC statement Darren Whitehead, 40-year-old man arrested after being shot while trying to carjack ride-share driver on Christmas Eve, 9 News, December 29, 2020. 20 Houston, TX, December 25, 2020 Click 2 Houston This all unfolded around 730 p.m. Friday in the cul-de-sac of a neighborhood on Sawgrass Ridge Lane near Grovedale Drive, authorities said. Deputies said they were called out to the scene by the shooter, Jamile Grimble, who has driven to a nearby truck stop to call 911. Authorities said Grimble told them he had been involved in a shooting and was turning himself in... Investigators learned that the street was crowded and Grimble had gotten into a dispute with neighbors over where to park. Grimble had been approached by several men, including Livingston, who he said were armed with handguns, deputies said. Grimble told deputies he was in fear of being shot, so he fired in self-defense, hitting Livingston. Deputies identified Paul Jones as another man involved in the dispute and took his statement. Authorities determined that Jones fired a weapon at Grimble. Surveillance video from the area also contradicted the statement Jones gave authorities, so he was subsequently charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Deputies said Jones girlfriend, Kati Mack, was also charged with tampering with evidence after they learned she had tried to hide the firearms used by Jones and Livingston...

One possible solution to the crunch in my district is manufactured housing, which can be more than 30 percent cheaper than traditional housing. Nationwide, almost 3 million manufactured homes are anchored in land leased communities, which means that residents own the homes but least the land underneath them. And many of these communities are being purchased by big, outside investors and increasingly, private equity firms. So Id like to talk about how tenants are affected by increased private equity investment in land leased communities.",affordable housing

What Id like to reiterate here is that manufactured homes can be a solution for affordable housing, a great solution, but only if we can address the problem of outside investors buying up MHCs and raising rents to extract as much profit as they can from the people that live there.

baltimore,Part 4 Columbia at 50: Media in the New Town: Communications part of building community; the Flier and the rest,2016-11-03T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,The Baltimore Sun,"It turned out to be a smart decision that gave Tom a quarter-century of employment, opportunity and influence. He was attracted by the enthusiasm of the new editor, Jean Moon. Jean says she recognized that Tom was better at reporting on zoning than she was, and she also offered a small raise. Despite that, I didnt say yes until I had a face-to-face with Zeke Orlinsky, the publisher, Tom said. Toms future wife, Mary Kay Sigaty, was working as a bank teller at the time, and she had warned me that the Fliers checks sometimes bounced. When I asked him about this, Zeke said that would never be a problem with my paycheck, and it wasnt. Maureen Kelley and I moved to Columbia a few months later, in June 1973. Maureen, newly graduated from nursing school at Boston College, where all four of us had met, got a job as a visiting nurse on her first interview. I got a job with another newspaper in town, Columbia Life, which was supposedly recapitalizing. An array of local newspapers serving Columbia in 1973-74., taken from the files of the Columbia Archives. Photo by Len Lazarick Columbia Life survived for another issue or two and then died without a trace. I sued the publisher for pay. All I got was an office desk and chair. Other newspapers have come and gone Columbia Villager, the News Columbian an edition of the conservative Central Maryland News, The Columbia Times an edition of The Howard County Times, and a bit later, the Columbia Forum. In the following decades, dailies would enter the local market with the Howard Sun and the Posts Howard Weekly. There were other publications along the way, The Business Monthly among them. But the paper that would become the dominant news source for Columbias first quarter-century was that puny little free shopper that started on a dining room table. Planning for Communications Communications is one of the thinner volumes in the many Green Books that document the meticulous planning and proposals for all aspects of Columbia life. The whole subject of communications in the planning of Columbia can only be described as a mystical religious icon which everybody revered with poignant regularity, wrote Wallace Hamilton, Rouses director of institutional planning. Weve got to think about communications, people would say. But nobody ever really did anything about it, except write long reports for longer conferences and got more and more people into the act to share the general confusion. We got intrigued with technology for technologys sake and lost track of function, Hamilton observed. Although their focus was on technology, the goal of the planners remained the same as for the village centers and neighborhood gathering places encouraging community life and spirit. The early planners reached out to the companies that were developing futuristic technologies that would become the driving forces of American communications in the final decades of the 20th century cable TV and then the Internet. But the planners were 10, 20, even 30 years early as they contemplated interactive TV loops and other forms of electronic two-way communications. For those under 40 and those who have forgotten, its worth refreshing what communications was like in the 1960s. There were telephones, an invention of the late 19th century, but they were all what we now call landlines, connected by copper wires, owned and operated by a single local monopoly we called the telephone company. There were urban TV stations, most of them part of the three major networks, broadcast over the airwaves to antennas. And radio, the early 20th century invention, was available almost everywhere. All these systems were regulated by the government at the federal or state level, with a complicated set of licensing. WLMD had a radio studio in the lower level of the Columbia Mall in 1979. Photo by WLMD engineer Mike Doughney. Some of the planners at the Rouse Co. wanted its own radio station, but that didnt happen until WLMD, a Laurel station, set up a small studio in the mall in 1979. It lasted only a couple of years. Columbias central location in the Baltimore-Washington corridor put it at the edge of both these big media markets. The available television channels were used up, with only slim possibilities for a UHF TV channel and an AM radio station. In October 1970, after much back and forth, Howard Research and Development, HRD, the Rouse division managing the new town, announced that Time-Life had been granted a franchise to establish cable television in Columbia. But the cable franchises were still under local control, and Time-Life backed out when it balked at provisions in the Howard County legislation. A local group won the rights in a partnership with Warner Communications. The Howard franchise was sold to Storer Cable, which became Comcast in 1993. Local Programming Andy Barth moved to Columbia in August 1971, the week The Mall in Columbia opened, conveniently located between Baltimore where he worked as a reporter for WMAR TV Channel 2 and his wifes job in Silver Spring. At first it was just convenient then we became converts to the Columbia vision of an integrated, inclusive community, said Barth, now press secretary to Howard County Executive Allan Kittleman. For two or three years, WMAR had a bureau located in the Exhibit Center next to Lake Kittamaqundi staffed by reporter Gene Cox. TV was very, very competitive then, said Barth. He eventually spent 35 years at WMAR before retiring to run for Congress in 2006. Columbia was a story at that point as the new town grew, he said. We did a birthday story pretty much every year. Many Baltimore TV personalities made Columbia their home, recalled Barth the late Al Sanders, Denise Koch, Dick Gelfman, Jeff Hager, and briefly, a young Oprah Winfrey, among others. Throughout the years, Howard County and Columbia have been part of a tug of war for eyeballs between rival TV stations for this lucrative, high-income market. There were many TV stories about the progressive ideas embodied in the Columbia concept, such as interfaith religious centers, but at some point it stopped being new, said Barth. Yet, for all that, these were stories done for a wider regional audience. In its first 30 years, the Columbia community relied on the oldest of the mass media, newspapers, and for several decades that medium was the Columbia Flier, from its start delivered free to all the households in town. Patuxent Publishing staff, including the Columbia Flier, sometime in the 1980s in the foyer of the Flier building. In the lower center are Publisher Zeke Orlinsky and General Manager Jean Moon. Editor Tom Graham is at the very bottom right Len Lazarick is second person to his left. Photographer unknown. The Flier Two years after Columbia Life folded and two non-journalism jobs later, a position finally opened at the Columbia Flier, where I had done some freelance writing. I had already helped the Flier move from its small flexi size into the tabloid it became in 1974, growing to 64 pages. After I became associate editor in 1975, I covered education, business and politics. In 1976, I wrote the cover story for its first 100-page issue, a piece titled Banned Books on efforts to ban some books from school libraries. We now know that we were all working in the heyday of the newspaper industry not just in Columbia or Maryland, but in the United States. Advertising revenues were bulging, profits were ballooning, staffing soared at every publication. There were people who loved the Flier there were people who hated the Flier, particularly the liberal bent of its publisher Zeke Orlinsky and his weekly Publishers Note. But love it or hate it, people read it. At one point, a survey found that 92 of Columbians read the paper that landed free every Thursday on their doorsteps and driveways. This was not your traditional newspaper produced by traditional newspaper people. Its models were magazines and the alternative city papers that grew out of the 60s counterculture. Its editors didnt just read The Washington Post and The New York Times, but The New Yorker and The Village Voice. It was in sharp contrast to its stodgy competitors, like the Sun. The Fliers sketchy origins in 1969 certainly gave no hint of the powerhouse it would become. I got pissed at something in the Howard County Times, recalled Orlinsky in a recent interview from his home in Westport, Conn. I didnt have a vision. The first issue of the Flier was indeed a flyer eight pages of legal paper folded with a Merriweather Post Pavilion ad on the front, ads for cars and tires, and a calendar of events. This first issue on Columbias June birthday in 1969 was reprinted several times over the years as a reminder of how far the newspaper had come. When Jean Moon joined the fledgling operation as a writer two years later, free circulation had grown to 9,000, and there was real news in the Flier, but they were still cutting and pasting the typewritten copy on a dining room table. At the time, Orlinsky wrote To reflect the growth of a new city like Columbia is to meet new challenges. It calls on a publisher to throw away the old and tired concept of journalism. Journalism is more than just information and news. Journalism should excite and guide a community. That statement was still being pointed to 20 years later in a history of the paper given to new staff members of a much larger enterprise. Moon, who had come to Columbia with her husband Bob for his job as an architect at the Rouse Co., was totally on board with the concept of community journalism that we werent dailies and the mission was to play a role in the community, she recalled recently. By 1973, Moon was editor and general manager, she had hired Graham, and the staff had grown several times. By the time I joined the staff on July 31, 1975, it was operating out of a building on Route 108. It moved again to Wilde Lake Village Center, and in spring of 1978, we moved into the Flier building on Little Patuxent Parkway, an unusual building designed by Bob Moon, standing out amid the towns bland architecture, with its white metal sides and sloping fronts of glass. There were no crusty old editors looking over our shoulders, telling us we dont do that here. Jean and Zeke and we often talked about them that way in this family-like operation were still in their 30s Tom and I were in our 20s, and the staff was of similar age. While Tom and I did take photos, we eventually brought on a staff of talented photographers who made that a hallmark of the paper in future years. The Flier was more than just a writers paper. Whats striking going through boxes of old clips I dragged out for this series was how closely we covered this new community the opening of restaurants, the closing of stores, the community dustups, the arguments over tot lots and door colors, the nitty-gritty of everyday life. While there were wonderful photo spreads and long features, there was also column after column of notices about routine events and meetings. Because of Jean Moons proclivities, there was massive coverage of the performing arts, not just in Columbia Merriweather Post Pavilion was going strong as a venue for big acts, but in Washington and Baltimore too. There was local sports galore including the long-time weekly column by Stan Ber called Bits and Pieces, a column that predated my arrival and survived long after I left 21 years later. Stan, like many of the other writers, was community bred. His day job was at the National Security Agency where he did what can never be disclosed and where they answered the phones cryptically with the last four digits of the extension you called. Most of us lived in Columbia. We were part of the community, and the community was part of the paper. Page three had the signed Publishers Note none of this unsigned editorial page stuff of the old school and then there were the letters, so many letters from Columbians, often complaining about Zekes emotional diatribes or other coverage that pushed the envelope, like the time we put the full-page image of a mammogram on the cover to illustrate a story on breast cancer. The Flier was the way the community talked to itself, understood itself, remembered itself. The advertising flowed in all the newspaper staples cars, groceries, real estate, classifieds. The smartest thing was not selling ads by the inch, as dailies did, producing those odd-shaped page wells, Orlinsky said. The Flier sold eighth-, quarter- and half-pages that made design easier and more attractive. More advertising meant more money, more pages, more stories to fill them, more staff to write and illustrate them, and more listings and made it a more attractive target for acquisition. The Sale of the Flier The night of Nov. 7, 1978, a major gubernatorial election, I was covering the returns in the Kiwanis Hall in Ellicott City, and a reporter from the Howard County Times asked me my reaction to the sale of the Columbia Flier. I was floored. Sale, what sale? Jean had tried to have me tracked down that night this was decades before cell phones so I would not learn of the deal from our local competitors who had gotten wind of it. Who were these guys at Whitney Communications? Turns out these guys and yes, they were all guys were some of the classiest in the business. The chairman, Walter Thayer, had been the publisher of the vaunted New York Herald Tribune, and the president was John Prescott, former president of The Washington Post Co. Millionaire John Hay Whitney had founded the company. It was one of the best things that ever happened to us. Jean and Zeke were left fully in charge. A year later we bought The Howard County Times and other papers in the chain. I got to spend full-time in Annapolis during the 90-day sessions as political editor. When John Hay Whitney died in 1982, the partners created a working fellowship that sent Tom Graham and then me to Paris for a year at the International Herald Tribune, where Whitney had been the managing partner of a three-way ownership split with the Post and The New York Times. We won award after award, both state and national, for writing in many categories, photography and design. The Flier kept chugging along, and in 1988, our newspaper group, now called Patuxent Publishing, bought Times Publishing in Towson and its five newspapers, including the Towson Times and The Jeffersonian. I became managing editor of seven Baltimore County papers. We never recovered from that purchase, said Jean Moon in a recent conversation. In hindsight, she said, We overpaid for those newspapers and struggled to make them generate enough return on that investment. Management began making cuts in the 1990s as Maryland experienced a harsher recession than the rest of the country. In 1995, a Whitney Communications partner and Zeke told Jean Moon she needed to go, and in June 1997, six months after I left, Patuxent and the Flier were sold to the Baltimore Sun and its new owner, Times-Mirror. I really dont think the sale will change anything about the newspapers, Orlinsky told me for a story I wrote about the sale in The Business Monthly. Its not in their interest to screw it up. Orlinsky stayed on as a consultant for a year, having twice sold the same paper at a handsome profit. He was wrong about nothing changing. Orlinsky says now he had seen some of the handwriting on the wall a few years before as the Internet began to spread. I didnt understand it but I knew that it was only a period of time before newspapers would lose those categories of classifieds employment ads, real estate and cars. What began as small dips in revenue in the 1990s became a steady downhill slide and then, in 2008, as the Great Recession hit, newspaper revenues fell off the cliff. As advertising evaporated, pages and coverage were cut, as were the reporters and editors who produced them. Along the way, Times-Mirror sold the Sun and the local papers to the Tribune Co., which went private and then bankrupt for years, and now has the god-awful name of tronc. Over the years it has decimated staff and closed offices, including the Flier building on Little Patuxent Parkway in 2011. The Flier is now run by editors in the Suns downtown Baltimore building. What were once several independent news operations in the city and the five counties that surround it are now under one owner, the Baltimore Sun Media Group, with copy shared among all. In the Flier you can read articles you may have already read in the Sun, or the other way around. From left, former Business Monthly Publisher Carole Pickett Ross, Columbia Association President Maggie Brown, who died in 2010, and former Business Monthly Editor-in-Chief Judy Tripp, who died in September. The only locally owned and operated news outlet is The Business Monthly, where this series is running before it is published here. Started in February 1993 by Ed and Carole Pickett as the Columbia Business Journal, it was geared to just a sliver of the community. It became The Business Monthly nine months later after Orlinsky registered all the other likely publication names, and the Picketts decided not to fight him. Carole grew up as Carole Ashbaugh in western Howard County, married Ed and had three children at a very young age. By the time they returned to Howard County, they had run several newspapers in Vermont, and radio stations as well. Carole, now Carole Ross, says it was her idea to start a business paper here, with Ed as editor. When Ed soon after decided also to launch the Columbia Daily Tribune, that was the last straw for Carole after many, many straws with her spendthrift hubby. She called it quits on the marriage, but kept The Business Monthly, 68,000 in debts and all. But aside from Eds spending, It made money from the very first issue, she said. From its start, one of The Business Monthlys gems were the columns by Dennis Lane, ostensibly about his field of commercial real estate, but really wise and funny commentaries on public life. Under the moniker WordBones, he became one of the best and most provocative bloggers on local life and added a podcast with attorney Paul Skalny to his media chops until he was brutally murdered in 2013. On Oct. 19, a new road near Merriweather Post Pavilion, where Dennis worked as a teenager, will be dedicated as part of Columbias revitalized downtown. It will be called Dennis Lane in an amusing tribute to an amusing writer in a town full of weird street names drawn from poetry and unconnected to persons living or dead. Carole sold The Business Monthly in 2002 to Becky Mangus and Cathy Yost. I worked with both sets of publishers from 1998 to 2006, when I became State House bureau chief of the Baltimore Examiner, which covered Howard County in its typically haphazard way, with its usually erratic free delivery, until its untimely demise in 2009. Not the Only Game in Town The Flier was never the only game in town. The Sun had an Ellicott City bureau for many years with Mike Clark reporting there for decades the News-American and Evening Sun were represented too. In the early 1980s, attempting to capture more suburban readers across the Baltimore region, the Sun set up the Howard Sun with a separate, and lower paid, staff that competed strongly with the Flier for stories and advertising. The Sun tried various configurations of separate Howard County sections for years after it bought the Flier and Howard County Times, and still has a thin section in the Sunday paper, though the content is often shared. The Washington Post also had the Howard Weekly, part of a plan to open bureaus in all the counties it served. It leased premium space in downtown Columbia, but never filled it. It was later replaced by the Howard Extra. The Post, for which I worked part-time on the national copy desk for eight years, and Tom Graham has for 16 years, has largely abandoned local coverage under the ownership of Amazons Jeff Bezos. Many Columbia residents mourn the loss of the Flier they remember from years ago, a fat, thriving community newspaper operation. Jean Moon, who created a new career for herself as a public relations consultant to some of the biggest organizations in Columbia, said, People complain all the time about how thin the Flier is. But she said those are people of our generation, meaning the over-65 crowd, bemoaning the good old days. I dont feel a concern about creating community anymore, Moon said. People see no need for a community newspaper. The Columbia Flier building on Little Patuxent Parkway has sat vacant for several years and may be torn down. Photo by Len Lazarick. Pat Kennedy, now 82, president of Columbia Association from 1972 to 1998, is one of those who mourns the loss of the Flier, which he saw as crucial in creating a vibrant community. The building that housed that crucial community builder has sat empty for several years. Howard County Executive Ken Ulman wanted to turn it into a business incubator, but for the Kittleman administration, the price tag was too high. It may now be torn down and replaced with affordable housing as part of downtown Columbias revitalization. For Kennedy, the tearing down of the Flier building stands as a metaphor for the decline of the newspaper industry as a whole.

baltimore,Washington: NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018--MOTION TO PROCEED--Continued,2017-07-25T00:00:00Z,Impact News Service,The Baltimore Sun,"dicaid is going to pay for that. To say that is insulting is a gross understatement. That is obscene. That is as close to uttering an obscenity as anything I can think of. So you bet we are going to fight when it comes to those kinds of decisions-- fight against those kinds of cuts. I mentioned that I had been on the road a good bit and have spent a lot of time in counties that are rural counties in Pennsylvania. Just to give you an example of the numbers, I live in a State that has 67 counties, and 48 of the 67 are rural. Those are our Pennsylvania counties. If you add up all of the individuals in those 48 rural counties in Pennsylvania who got insurance by way of the Medicaid expansion--or received insurance in the marketplaces in the intervening years between passage of the ACA and currently--just in those 48 counties, over 278,000 people have healthcare--278,266. I use a precise number because right down to the 66, it matters. Every single one of those individuals in those 48 rural counties should have an ironclad guarantee that no bill will pass the U.S Senate that will rip away their healthcare, not for one person. That should be our promise to them. That is the number of people covered, right? With the Medicaid expansion plus the marketplace, 278,266 residents of rural Pennsylvania are covered. If the Senate bill passed, here is at least one estimate of what would happen to those rural counties 151,000-plus people. I will not use the exact number because it is an estimate. The estimate is that around 150,000 people would lose their health insurance. You move forward in rural Pennsylvania by over 278,000 people then you take two steps backward and rip healthcare away from 150,000 in rural Pennsylvania. I havent gotten to the big population centers. That is the reality in Pennsylvania. Then if you break it down even further--these are just 11 rural counties that I visited in the month of July in addition to other counties. In 11 rural Pennsylvania counties--these are counties with very small populations. One of them, Forest County, which I was in this weekend, has a little more than 7,000 people in its total population. In these 11 rural Pennsylvania counties, 54,180 people have healthcare today because of Medicaid expansion, plus those who got it through the marketplace, so 54,180 get healthcare. What is the estimate of who would lose if the bill passed? It is 32,410. Lets call it 30,000, roughly, because it is an estimate. So 54,000 gain then you rip it away from 30,000. Does that make any sense at all? Does that help the country? How are we stronger after that? How are we better off as a country or, in my case, as a State? How are the people of our Commonwealth better off when 30,000 in 11 rural counties lose their coverage--or 150,000 in 48 rural counties? I know I am over my time, and I will wrap up because we have colleagues here. This is a pivotal moment. To say it is a pivotal moment for the Senate is a big understatement, but it is also, I think, a pivotal moment for the country. We are going to be on a different path than we have been for a long time. Usually what happens over time is that you are expanding protections, enlarging the number of people who are the beneficiaries of protections of one kind or another. In this case, we would be going in the wrong direction. I hope our colleagues will think long and hard before they vote yes either to move forward to debate on a bill that is Page S4144 deeply flawed or to vote for the bill itself. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for being here. We have been out here many a night, talking about the importance of Medicaid. I so appreciate his leadership in the Senate on this very important issue. He has been a champion of the Childrens Health Insurance Program and has been a voice amongst all Senators in making sure that people have access to healthcare. I so appreciate being out here with him tonight. I dont really appreciate being here right at this moment. I am really flabbergasted. Why are we here at this moment? Why are we here? I am pretty sure that President Trump, when he was candidate Trump, put in a tweet that he would not cut Medicaid. Yet that is the proposal we are talking about. No matter what the proposal is--repeal, the House bill, the proposal scored by CBO or some Senate alternative on junk insurance--they all are a cut to Medicaid, so I am not sure how we are here. I am not sure how we are here when the Vice President at the time campaigned, I am sure, against the Affordable Care Act and then became Governor of Indiana and implemented Medicaid expansion in his own State. After saying that he was against the Affordable Care Act, he implemented Medicaid expansion. I am sure people in his home State said If you want to take care of people, if you want to raise our standard of living, if you want to keep down the costs of healthcare delivery and private insurance, put people on coverage so that they arent driving up the cost of uncompensated care. So how are we here? How are we here when our House colleagues came up with a proposal that basically cuts 23 million people off of healthcare--including 15 million people on Medicaid--after working with the President, who said that he didnt want to cut Medicaid, and the Vice President, who basically campaigned against it and then went ahead and expanded it? I cant believe how many times I have been on the Senate floor, and I havent seen one of my colleagues come down here and talk about solutions that they are proposing. I just hear them come and talk about the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and kicking millions of people off of the healthcare they currently have. Tonight, I can imagine there are many people across the United States of America who are like me, thinking, how could this be happening? How could we be sitting here tonight, not knowing what the Senate is going to vote on, not knowing whether they are going to repeal their health insurance, not knowing where their Senators stand or even if the Senator knows what proposal they are voting on? Yet I can tell you this More than 70 percent of the American people think the ideas that have now been put forth by the House and the Senate Republicans and the President do not work. They are not the way to increase access to healthcare and drive down the cost of private insurance in the insurance market. You dont have to take my word for it. I am looking at a statement by Ohios Republican Governor, John Kasich. I worked with John Kasich in the House of Representatives. He was a budget hawk. He wanted to figure out how to make things work. So I trust that, as Governor, he is a fiscal steward about how to get things done when he says Until Congress can step back from political gamesmanship and come together with a workable, bipartisan plan, it is a mistake for the Senate to proceed with a vote on Tuesday and force a one-sided deal that the American people are clearly against. So why are we here? Why are we here when a President promised that he wasnt going to cut Medicaid, a Vice President said that he was against the bill but then went and did Medicaid expansion? The people in the United States responded very clearly that they are not interested in cutting millions of people off of health insurance because they know that, even if it doesnt affect their family, it doesnt make common sense for keeping down the costs of healthcare. So I ask my colleagues to stop and think about the people in the United States of America who are clearly scared to death about what is going to happen tomorrow. They are scared that someone in their family or that they, the provider for their family, are not going to be able to provide insurance. If you are so brave, come down here and volunteer, as an amendment, to cut all of us--cut the Senate off of our access to health insurance until we come up with some idea that you think is so terrific. I doubt you will come and propose that. You wouldnt want your family cut off of healthcare. I meet people like Emily Talbot, who came to visit me from Seattle Childrens Hospital, who at age 6 was diagnosed with a condition that affected her brain tissues and spinal canal. She was from Idaho, and she was referred to Seattle Childrens because it is the pediatric referral center for our region. Thanks to Medicaid, she saw 11 different pediatric subspecialists and had 13 brain surgeries and 7 back surgeries. Her mom told me that without Medicaid and without the prohibition on lifetime caps, she wouldnt have access to healthcare today. Is that what my Republican colleagues want to say tomorrow, that we dont really know for sure how we are going to do this, we dont really know what works, but even though we said we werent going to cut Medicaid, we are going to cut people off of health insurance who currently have coverage? I think the reason why people like these Governors from Republican States have been willing to speak out against this proposal and raise their concerns is because they have to be a steward of Medicaid, and they have to be fiscally responsible. So they know there are better ways. When I talk to the regional hospitals in my State, they tell me that covering more people under Medicaid has created downward pressure on price in the individual market. It has helped us. So our solution cannot be decimating the Medicaid market. Our solution has to look at those in the individual market who dont have as much clout as a big employer or somebody who can buy in bulk and drive down their price. There are ways to address that issue. I look forward to working with my colleagues on those solutions, but that is not what is being recommended tomorrow. Those solutions havent been put forth, nor are they part of any of these proposals. So I ask my colleagues to not proceed. The President promised he was not going to cut Medicaid, and now it is like you want somebody to jump off the cliff tomorrow, and you are saying Oh, by the way, I will throw you a parachute on the way down. It doesnt work. As my colleagues have said here tonight, it is time to give certainty to this population that we have a proposal that will help continue to give them access to care. I would say to my colleagues that taking a vote on politics when it is the lives and the healthcare access that so many millions of Americans seek--dont play politics with healthcare. Lets get a solution that works and works on both sides of the aisle. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, let me open my remarks by saying that from the very beginning of this ill-starred healthcare misadventure the Republicans have been on, Democrats have over and over again offered to help and to participate. Over and over again, we have spoken to, for instance, Chairman Alexander on the HELP Committee, saying Give us a shot. Try something. We can do this. You have talked all these years about regular order. How many times have we heard the majority leader say that regular order is the way to go and talk about how important the Senate is because it follows regular order? It looks as though all of that was nothing but a lot of bunkum because when he had the chance to come here and actually trust the Senate to work through regular order, what did he do? The very first day, he jammed through reconciliation to open a purely partisan pathway to undoing ObamaCare. Well, people have discovered that a lot of what they thought was their Page S4145 good healthcare is ObamaCare. So people on Medicaid, people whose private policies now dont have preexisting condition limits, caps on how much can be spent in a year or in a lifetime, folks who will get their money through the exchange, suddenly they have all discovered Oh my gosh, that was ObamaCare. Dont take that away from me. That is one of the reasons we see all of the groups who come here concerned about healthcare lined up against this bill. This bill, other than the creepy cabal of billionaires who are behind it, doesnt have a friend. And it just shows how narrow the Republican Party has now become that they will follow the creepy billionaires off the cliff against the advice of so many respected American organizations. How about the American Cancer Society? The American Cancer Society says that the Republican bill would leave patients and those with preexisting conditions paying more for less coverage. They have come out against the bill. I have a constituent home in Rhode Island, and her name is Patricia. She and her daughters live in a beautiful place in Rhode Island, Wakefield, RI. Like a lot of people I have heard from, Patricia is afraid. She is afraid that what this Congress is going to do is to repeal the Affordable Care Act and let health insurers go back to discriminating against people with preexisting conditions. What is hers? Well, Patricia and her daughters have a genetic mutation, and that genetic mutation increases their risk of cancer. They would ordinarily be counting on the American Cancer Society to argue for them, and sure enough, the American Cancer Society has come out against the Republican health legislation. Well, it got real for Patricia last year when her 34-year-old daughter was battling breast cancer. Fortunately, her health insurance covered her treatment, and it worked. She is now cancer-free. But because of their genetic mutation, Patricia and her daughters will need to be screened frequently for the rest of their lives. Under the Affordable Care Act, these potentially lifesaving screenings are covered, and Patricia and her daughters are not penalized for having a preexisting condition. Why on Earth would you want to go back to a world in which those two things werent true? Patricia wrote A genetic mutation is not caused by an unhealthy or careless lifestyle, as some members of Congress seem to think. You can do everything right and still end up with cancer or another debilitating disease. So she urged me to consider all the people who would be affected by the new healthcare bill, not just looking out for the rich and the healthy. Another group who came out against this was the American Association of Retired Persons, the AARP. This bill may have changed, but the results are the same. The results are higher costs and less coverage for older Americans. Why would you want to do that? And this isnt just language from the AARP it comes home again. Lisa from Pascoag, up in northern Rhode Island--a bucolic, rural part of Rhode Island--wrote to share her experience with the Affordable Care Act. This is her and her husbands third year on their ACA plan. Like many Rhode Islanders, they qualify for financial assistance to help them afford their health insurance. You would think that would be a good thing. Lisa thinks it is a good thing. She wrote to me that she thanks God every day that they have quality health insurance they can afford. Her husband is a welder fabricator--a job that takes a toll. He has had several blood tests this year and recently began seeing a hematologist. Lisa knows that this type of specialty care would have been out of reach for their family without their current coverage, and so she is worried. She is frightened by the Republican health plan. She and her husband are 56 and 62 years old. They are within AARPs interests. And she understands that because of their age, under the Republican plan, their premiums could go up five to eight times what they are paying today--five to eight times what they are paying today-- and the tax credits that have been proposed, in Lisas words, wont cut it. Doctors know a little bit about healthcare, and the American College of Physicians has come out in opposition. The BCRA . . . will not preserve and improve essential coverage, benefits and consumer protections, and access to care is their concern. Of course, why would you want to listen to the doctors about healthcare when you have a little pack of creepy billionaires who are telling you what to do? Never bother to listen to the doctors. Well, Judith from Riverside, RI, is a doctor. She is a physician who works at a community mental health center in Providence. Judy told me that she sees the benefits of the Affordable Care Act every single day. She treats patients with serious mental illnesses, and they have what she called tremendous healthcare and social service needs. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, almost all of her patients were uninsured, and she spent her days scrambling to try to find different avenues to get them free care, to get them whatever they could scrounge. Since the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, she said, almost all of her patients have health insurance and they are able to get the medical care they need. As Judy put it, with all of their life challenges, at least they dont have to worry that they cant afford care. Planned Parenthood is a favorite target of our Republican friends, and Planned Parenthood is strongly opposed to these measures. Women get a lot of their healthcare from Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood said With this latest version of TrumpCare, women will pay the biggest price of all. Olive is a young woman living in Providence who shared her experience with me about how Planned Parenthood has been a reliable source of healthcare for her throughout her life. As a college student, Olive went to Planned Parenthood for birth control and well-woman care. She had a routine exam, and a doctor at Planned Parenthood found a lump in her breast. Twenty years old and far from her family, Olive said she was worried but never felt alone. Planned Parenthood connected her with the followup care and testing that she needed. She was treated by their doctors. Fortunately, the mass turned out to be benign, but Olive says she is forever grateful to Planned Parenthood for their help to her during a scary situation for a young woman. Olive is still a patient at Planned Parenthood, and she even volunteers at their health clinic in Providence. She knows firsthand how important Planned Parenthood is for healthcare for millions of men and women across the country--particularly women--and, like the other people who have written to me, she is afraid of what will happen if Republicans succeed in defunding Planned Parenthood. Small business folks have spoken to me about this. There is a lot of talk about how you need more freedom not to have insurance and freedom to be told you cant have insurance if you are sick. That is not the kind of freedom I think we really want to support around here. The freedom we want to support is for somebody to be able to follow their dreams, and over and over again, I hear from people who are able to get free of being linked to their employer healthcare plan and go out on their own because of the Affordable Care Act. Laura is a small business owner in our capital city, Providence. She and her husband own an architectural design and construction firm that builds homes around Rhode Island. Construction is not a line of work you want to be in without health insurance. Well, because of the Affordable Care Act, Laura and her husband have affordable health insurance and dental coverage, and they have it for the first time. They can see the doctors they want to see, and their out-of-pocket costs are reasonable. The Affordable Care Act has allowed small business owners like Laura and her husband to pursue their professional dreams, boosting our local economy and creating jobs for others without having to risk their livelihoods and life savings if an illness or an injury befalls them. Just last night, I was in Narragansett, RI, and a woman came up to me to say When you get back down there, please fight for us on the Affordable Care Act. Page S4146 She said The Affordable Care Act has given me two things. One, it has given me my freedom. Because of the Affordable Care Act, I was able to leave my employer-supported program and have the confidence to go out on my own and become an illustrator. Her business is so successful that she has actually started hiring people to support her business. She said That freedom to be an entrepreneur, to succeed, would never ever have happened if I had been chain-locked to my employer program and did not have an affordable option like the Affordable Care Act provides. Second, she said Once I did this, once I started my business, I then went for checkups. I was able to get tests that I could not have gotten before, and what they found was a tumor behind my eye. Luckily, it was not cancerous, but had they not caught it, she said, I would have lost my sight. If you are an illustrator, being blind is a very tough proposition. She said I have my freedom, and I have my sight because of this law. Sheldon, fight for me. Janice from Cranston is the last person I will mention tonight. She wrote in to share how important the Affordable Care Act has been to her and her husband and how important our Rhode Island marketplace has been for her. She said There may be marketplaces that arent working in different places around the country. Fine, go fix those. Dont mess with mine. It is working in Rhode Island, and Janice is one of the beneficiaries of it. She is now retired. She lives with her husband Bob in Cranston. Before the Affordable Care Act, she tried to buy health insurance in the individual market, and it was quoted to her at 800 per month--not affordable to her, not with limited income like that. So Janice and Bob have quality affordable insurance through Rhode Islands health insurance exchange, and they are happy about it. Dont disrupt their lives. Janice actually told me that her health insurance premium actually went down this year, and so she splurged with the savings and bought dental insurance as well. That was a success. She wrote to me I wouldnt have been able to afford healthcare if it wasnt for ObamaCare. Like so many of these other people who have written in, Janice says that she and Bob are scared to death that they will lose their insurance if the Affordable Care Act is repealed. She doesnt understand how some Members of Congress can claim to care about their constituents and still try to repeal their healthcare coverage. Janice said They have money and they have good insurance, and they must not know what it is like for people like us. Well, we need to remember those real people out there who are getting the Medicaid benefit, who are getting affordable insurance through the exchanges and getting help with the premiums and the people who are on private insurance but no longer have to face lifetime caps or annual caps or preexisting conditions. Even people who are still on Blue Cross have gotten a benefit from this. Why would we want to take that all away? The last thing I want to mention is this. Those are all personal stories, and it is really important to remember that behind this creepy billionaire effort to perform some kind of ideological experiment on people by taking away their healthcare, there are actually real people who are really going to suffer in their real lives, and it will have been deliberately done to them by people here who simply couldnt say no to the creepy billionaires. There is another piece of this. It is a little more complicated, but I will close on this. I love to use this graph. I use it all the time. This axis of the graph shows how long people live in different countries. The range is from 72 to 86. This part of the graph shows how much people pay in different countries for healthcare per year. Virtually everybody that we compete with is right in here--Japan, Greece, United Kingdom, Germany, and France. They are right in here. They do pretty well on life expectancy, and here they are in this cross of the 2,000 to 6,000 per year range. The most expensive other country in the world is Switzerland, at 6,000 per year. Look at where the United States is. We spend 8,500 per year--way more, double more than what the average is of the other countries we compete against. For that we get super killer life expectancy. I guess killer life expectancy isnt the right phrase to use. But do you get great life expectancy on that vast expenditure of healthcare? No. We compete with the Czech Republic. We compete with Croatia. Part of what the Affordable Care Act did was to try to focus on this. Here is the punch line. One of the things we do in the Budget Committee is that we look at things in 10-year chunks. If you look at the 10-year chunk from 2018, which is this year right here, to 2027, here is a 10-year period. What this graph shows is that, back here in 2010, the Congressional Budget Office did a prediction of what the healthcare costs for the country was going to be in this 10-year period. They said this is how much we are going to have to spend on Federal healthcare. What happened is that we passed the Affordable Care Act and costs started to go down. They came in below expectations. Around here, they rebooted the test, and they did a new projection based on the new information for this same 10-year period. As you will notice, the costs that we have projected for that 10-year period from 2018 to 2027, inclusive, have fallen. They have fallen by 3.3 trillion. If you want to talk about savings on our debt and deficit, if you want to talk about savings in healthcare, this red line was projected before the Affordable Care Act, and the green line--the difference--was the projection after the Affordable Care Act was law and after the results began to come in. I cant promise you that every single one of those 3.3 trillion in savings was a direct result of a provision in the Affordable Care Act, but when we have delivered 3.3 trillion in savings, why would we never want to talk about that? Why would we want to put any of that at risk? Why would we want to go back to the preexisting condition of this prediction and pile 3.3 trillion back into that out-year period? It makes no sense. So whether you are a person who has constituents who are real and who are going to suffer, who are going to suffer in real life as a result of the decision and the vote that you cast tomorrow, or whether you are a propeller-headed budget hawk who just wants to figure out how you can reduce Americas costs, why would you vote for a bill and put any of this at risk? Why the fear of your constituents? Why the 3.3 trillion in savings? It makes no sense. I will end where I began. If people will come to their senses and want to do this in a bipartisan fashion, during regular order--boy, did we hear a lot about regular order until regular order wasnt wanted any longer--we are here. We want to work with you. There are tons of ideas out there. We can work to improve the healthcare system for the real people in the real world, and not just do what we are told by a cabal of creepy billionaires who are yanking the chain of the Republican Party. With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts. Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, a few weeks ago the Senate Republicans had to cancel a vote on the healthcare bill because the number crunchers over at the Congressional Budget Office, or the CBO, pointed out that the Republican bill was going to take away health insurance from 22 million people and drive up the costs for millions more. So Senate Republicans started throwing new plans together, one after another, rolling the dice and hoping the CBO would come back with a better number. Here is a quick guide to what the Republicans have tried since the last time they canceled their vote on this bill. First, there was a bill that was, basically, the same as the first version but that included a little bit more money. CBO said it still knocked 22 million people off their healthcare coverage. Second, there was a bill to simply repeal the Affordable Care Act, with no replacement whatsoever. CBO said that one would knock 32 million people off their healthcare. Third, there was a proposal by Senator Cruz that would let insurance companies offer insurance at one price to people with no preexisting conditions and another price for anybody who had anything wrong. We dont Page S4147 even have a CBO score for that one because CBO had trouble figuring out how many people with preexisting conditions who really needed insurance would never be able to pay for it under that bill. Why is it that the Republicans have so much trouble coming up with something--with anything--that would improve healthcare in America? The problem is that the Republicans real motivation behind all these healthcare bills is not to improve healthcare. It is to give giant tax cuts to the richest families and corporations in this country. When the goal is a big tax cut, it is hard to come up with something that actually also improves peoples healthcare. The Republican healthcare bills have gone from bad to worse to embarrassing. What makes this so painful, however, is that the health-- even the survival--of real people hangs in the balance. A couple of weeks ago, I met with families who said they hoped--they said they prayed--the Senate would not pass this terrible health bill. Each of these families had a small child who had been born with complex medical needs. I met Baxter, who is only 3 years old and has cerebral palsy. I met Tom, who was born 4 months prematurely and needed multiple surgeries to help correct his medical conditions. I met Brody, who was born with his organs growing outside his body in a protective sac. He spent more than 7 months at Boston Childrens Hospital, undergoing complicated surgeries to fit his organs back inside his body. I met these children, and I have to state that all of these kids are fighters. Every one of them has endured great pain and shown courage and determination. Every one of them has needed help from Medicaid for hospital bills, breathing equipment, special feeding tubes, physical therapists, speech therapists, and nurses to help train the family on how to clean a blocked IV line or how to deal with seizures. Medicaid means these children get the medical care they need, and it means they can live at home instead of in an institution. It means their families dont have to go bankrupt. It is that simple. Without this help, these families would be destroyed. These children and their families are the face of Medicaid, and we fight every day to protect them. Just to be clear, Baxters mother said to me that, without the help that Medicaid provided, Baxter would have died. They are good, hardworking parents with jobs and insurance, but they didnt have the millions of dollars it took to keep Baxter alive or the money to buy the equipment and support they needed to keep Baxter at home. Yes, this is about life and death, and if anyone doubts it, call Baxters mom and ask her to explain it to you. The Republican plan isnt just cruel. It is immoral, and it is not who we are as a people. We are better than that. We shouldnt even be holding this vote tomorrow. The American people have begged Republicans to stop. Governors from red States and blue States alike have told them that this bill will be deeply harmful. Patient groups, the American Medical Association, pediatricians, nurses, hospital groups, nursing homes, and the AARP have all sounded the alarm, saying these bills would do irreparable damage to our health system and to families that are trying to take care of their loved ones. I urge Republicans to stop the politics. People across this country-- Democrats, Republicans, and Independents--dont want you to repeal healthcare for millions of people. Listen to those people. Listen to Baxter and Tom and Brody. Listen to all the people who love them. I know there is a lot we could do to make healthcare more affordable in this country. I know there is a lot we could do to make our delivery system work better. We could work together and build something better for all of America. But we cant even start down that path if we rip away healthcare from millions of Americans. We just cannot do this. It is wrong. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota. Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for her good words and her advocacy. I rise to join her and my colleagues on the floor in sharing the concerns I continue to hear every single day in my State, whether it is just simply walking the parades, as I did in Stillwater, MN, where people would come up off the sides, or, on the Fourth of July, when a family with a child with Down syndrome just came off the side of the parade and grabbed me and said we need healthcare for our son, that we cannot cut him off, that we cannot make these drastic, draconian reductions to Medicaid--because he is the face for Medicaid. Right now, as far as I know, we have many versions of this healthcare bill. I think I heard this version referred to as option C. I was thinking that is not really correct because we have had options A and B. Those were the two House healthcare bills. We had options C and D, which were the two Senate healthcare bills. Then we went to option E, which was back to the idea of repealing without having a replacement. Now, as far as I know, after doing A, B, C, D, and E, we are at plan F. My mom was a teacher her entire life, and I learned from her that you cannot get much lower than F, right? I think it is time to set a new course, and that is to work together for a better grade for the American people and for a better healthcare plan, which means working across the aisle to make changes to the Affordable Care Act. The Minnesotans whom I have heard from do not like A, B, C, D, E, or F. On Friday, in fact, I received a letter that was signed by 121 different Minnesota healthcare organizations, and it talked about these past proposals. They wrote this Minor changes or amendments will not change the ultimate impact of these bills and their deep and devastating impact on Minnesota and its citizens. What were these groups? They were pretty mainstream groups, those being the AARPMinnesota, our childrens hospitals, the Autism Society of Minnesota, our nursing homes, the Minnesota Hospital Association, the Minnesota Nurses Association, Mental HealthMinnesota, our Catholic Health Association, our addiction treatment professionals, and many more. As different as these groups may be in their missions and in the work they do and who belongs to them and where they live, what they have in common is that they are dedicated to taking care of the health and well-being of Minnesotans. They are scared about what would happen if any of these proposals--A, B, C, D, E, or F--were to pass. They have seen that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that with a number of these bills, it would mean that over 20 million people, if not all of them, would lose their health insurance, that Medicaid would get cut by more than 700 billion, and that out-of- pocket costs would skyrocket. Deductibles for a benchmark plan could reach 13,000 by 2026. They have seen that the Congressional Budget Office has found that a repeal bill without a replacement would be even worse, as 32 million people would lose their coverage, and premiums would double. I understand why these Minnesota healthcare organizations are scared about these bills, but the people who are even more scared are the citizens of my State who depend on the Affordable Care Act for their healthcare. As I said, we all knew, on the day it passed, that the Affordable Care Act was a beginning and not an end. You cannot pass a major piece of legislation like that without making changes over time. Unfortunately, with the exception of a few minor things, we have been, basically, blocked from making changes because we are always having thrown at us this idea of simply repealing everything and causing chaos. After the sentiment of the American people has been made quite clear--and you do not have to look at a poll to know that all you have to do is walk down the Main Street during any parade in our State--now is the time for us to work across the aisle and make some positive changes. What are those changes? For one, we know we must bring some certainty to the exchanges and stabilize the market. Page S4148 I see the Senator from New Hampshire here who is the former Governor of New Hampshire. She knows, along with her colleague Senator Shaheen, we need to have more certainty in the marketplace. That is why we support the bill that would do that. We should vote on that bill. I also support Senators Kaine and Carpers legislation--the Individual Health Insurance Marketplace Improvement Act--to reestablish a Federal reinsurance program. This bill would lower premiums by providing support for high-cost patients. Now, the Republican legislature in my State--both houses are Republican--joined with the Democratic Governor in our State and passed a similar State-based reinsurance program. I know Alaska, which, by all accounts, is a red State, has passed a reinsurance program that recently got approval from this administration. Just last week, as Senator Hassan knows, New Hampshire announced its plans to pursue one as well. So we can and we should come together to pursue this as one change we can make positively for the Nation. Another is, it is long past time to do something about the rising cost of prescription drugs. I have a bill--and I see my colleague from Minnesota here as well, Senator Franken. We have worked on this issue together on both bills, which is similar to this issue of harnessing the negotiating power of 41 million seniors who are on Medicare in order to bring drug prices down. Right now, Medicare is literally banned from negotiating on behalf of 41 million seniors. The last time I checked, the senior citizens in my State had a lot of power, and 41 million people, especially seniors, is a lot of negotiating power. Lets harness that because it will not just help to bring drug prices down in the Medicare Program, but it will help down the line for all citizens. There is the bringing in of more competition. One way you do that is by dangling the prospect of competition from other countries. You can do it with a trigger that is based on the number of competitors you have in a certain market. You can do it based on an increase in price or you can just do it. I and Senator McCain, who is certainly in our thoughts and prayers this week, have long had a bill to allow Americans to bring in safe, less expensive drugs from Canada. That is very similar to that of the U.S market. As I have often noted when I talk about this bill, we can see Canada from our porch in Minnesota. We can see those lower prices right across the border. When we have developed so many lifesaving drugs, when we have done the research, when we have put government money--taxpayer money--into the research, why in this country do we have the most expensive drugs in the world? I can tell you why. It is that we have not done anything about it here because, for too long, the pharmaceutical companies have been able to have their way when it comes to legislation. This is the end of that. Finally, the American people are starting to see this as not just campaign rhetoric but as a real problem when 4 out of the top 10 best selling drugs have gone up over 100 percent in just the last 10 years. Here are some more ideas. Senator Lee and I have a bill--bipartisan, across the aisle--that would again allow the temporary importation of safe drugs that have been on the market in another country for at least 10 years when there is not healthy competition for that drug in this country. Generics. I and Senator Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, have a bill to stop something called pay for delay, which is when big pharmaceutical companies actually pay off generic companies to keep less expensive products off the market. That is an outrage. I would challenge any Senator to vote against that. I do not think one will. That is why we need a vote, and that is a perfect example of a bipartisan bill that could be included in a package of measures that could be improvements on the Affordable Care Act. How about this one? It is the CREATES Act, which is another bipartisan bill with me, Senator Grassley, Senator Leahy, Senator Feinstein, Senator Lee, and many others that would put a stop to tactics in which pharmaceutical companies refuse to provide samples that the generic companies need to develop new drugs. According to the Congressional Budget Office, this legislation would save taxpayers 3.5 billion, and the one I just mentioned on pay for delay would save taxpayers 2.9 billion. Why would we say to the taxpayers of this country that we will not do that, that we will not even allow it to come up for a vote? These are votes the Senate should and must take. Bringing up a bill that devastates the Medicaid Program or that repeals big parts of the Affordable Care Act, without having a replacement, does the opposite. It does nothing. These bills--A, B, C, D, E, or F--do nothing in terms of bringing down pharmaceutical prices. What is this really about? It is about the identical twins whom I met yesterday from Cambridge, MN, which is a small town--a town similar, I am sure, to the towns the Presiding Officer would find in his State or to the towns in New Hampshire or to the towns Senator Whitehouse would see in Rhode Island. This is about identical twins. One of the twins is a pitcher, and one of the twins is a catcher on their softball team. One of the twins found out, just in the last year, that she has juvenile diabetes. It is a very dangerous, dangerous thing to have at that young age. The other twin is perfectly healthy. Of course, the family had to go immediately to the doctor. They bought insulin, and the insulin had gone up three times what it should have in just the last few years. It is very difficult for them to afford now. They got the strips. They had to do all of this, and the price kept escalating. To add to everything else, now this mom is worried that one of her daughters, not two, will have a preexisting condition and be kicked off of the insurance. Think about that. They are identical twins. It could be either one. You do not know which one. Is it the catcher? Is it the pitcher? It is a lottery. If you do not have healthcare like the Affordable Care Act in place, it is like a lottery. You do not know which one of them is going to be kicked off the insurance, not have insurance, and get very sick and possibly die. That is what we are talking about here. That is not what this country is about. It could happen to anyone--to anyone in this Chamber, to anyone up in the Gallery, to anyone at home. You do not know when it is going to happen to you or your sister or your brother or your neighbor or your dad or your mom or your grandma or your grandpa. That is why we have affordable healthcare insurance. This debate is also about our seniors and our rural communities. As Senator Franken knows, we have heard time and time again from our rural hospitals--from Aurora to Gilbert, to Tower. I was up there recently, and that is what I heard about--the rural hospitals and how difficult it is going to be for them if any of these bills pass. I know it is something our Republican colleagues, all of whom are from rural States--Senators Collins, Capito, and Murkowski--have expressed real concerns about with regard to the impact of some of the proposed Medicaid cuts and what they would do in their States. Opioids. Both the Senator from New Hampshire who is here with me today, Senator Hassan, and certainly Senator Whitehouse have been leaders in this area. That is why we passed the Cures Act. That is why we put a bunch of funding from the Cures Act into opioid addiction treatment. That is why we passed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act on a bipartisan basis--one of the few bills that made it through last year. You cannot just run TV ads on it, and you cannot just put it on campaign brochures and then go out 6 months later and cut Medicaid, which provides the treatment for 32 percent of opioid medication- assisted treatments we have in our State. You cannot do that. You cannot give beautiful speeches and go to press conferences and then make those kinds of cuts. I know my colleagues on both sides of the aisle understand this. This is a time when we can chart a different path forward, when we can end up where we should have begun but still standing, and that is by working together to find some positive changes to the Affordable Care Act for the Page S4149 American people. Again, I said it on the day it passed--it is a beginning and not an end. Lets seize this moment, open the door, and work together for the American people. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota. Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the effort by Republicans in the majority to rip apart our healthcare system and jeopardize the protections for people with preexisting conditions and to throw millions of people off their health insurance. Now, it is deeply troubling at this point that with less than 24 hours until the expected vote, we dont even know which version of repeal the Republicans hope to pass. Do Republicans support the Better Care Reconciliation Act--the bill that according to the Congressional Budget Office, would cause 22 million more Americans to become uninsured, which would drive up healthcare costs and dismantle the Medicaid Program? Do they support the Cruz amendment, which would bring back junk insurance plans that offer virtually no protection and drive up out-of-pocket costs for vital services or will they rally behind their backup option, a plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with nothing--that is, nothing--an approach that would add 32 million more Americans to the ranks of the uninsured and cause average premiums in the nongroup market to double or will it be something else entirely? We dont know. This is reckless. This is irresponsible. The American people deserve better. Lets be clear. A vote for the motion to proceed is a vote to move forward with conceivably any one of these bills, and all of these bills are terrible. They jeopardize lifesaving care and treatment for millions of American families, especially those with preexisting conditions. They tear apart our safety net and give tax breaks to powerful corporations. Let me remind my Republican colleagues that a vote in support of the motion to proceed will have real-world consequences for your constituents who may lose their health insurance. Perhaps these are people you have met people, many of whom may be losing sleep out of justified fear that their children or their parents, their loved ones or they themselves are at risk of losing their healthcare. I have talked to so many people in my State about these dangerous proposals. There is Kristi. Kristi is a young farmer in Greater Minnesota whose husband and two kids relied on Medicaid to access care when their farm was struggling. There is Sandy, whose mom is in a nursing home and who doesnt know how she will pay for the round-the-clock care her mother needs if Medicaid, which covers more than 6 in 10 nursing home residents nationwide, scales back coverage. Then, this is Sheri, who said that if it werent for Medicaid, her son Brandon, who has cerebral palsy and hydrocephalus, probably wouldnt be here. I met Brandon. I think he is 18 or 19. He was born 15 weeks early, in Minneapolis, about a pound and a half. They took him to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester. The Mayo Clinic said We cant handle him, so they sent him back to Minneapolis to Gillette Childrens Hospital, which could. They told Brandons parents He is going to require 1 million in care the first day to save his life. Brandon has had, I think, 37, 38 surgeries. He spoke at a meeting we had on Medicaid a couple of weeks ago in Minnesota, and he stood--he had a walker. He had just gotten an A-minus in his first college course. He was actually, in a way, the last person in the room I was worried about because his resilience--this guy, this kid is going to be amazing. I dont think he would be here if we didnt have the kind of Medicaid we have and the kind of Medicaid my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are talking about limiting in a way that will affect so many people I have met across my State. This is one of those votes that will go down in history. It is one of those votes that all of us will be answering for wherever we go for the rest of our lives. The former Republican Senator from Minnesota, David Durenberger, outlined some of the reasons Senators should not vote for this consequential legislation in an excellent op-ed, a piece he wrote, and it was in USA TODAY today. Senator Durenberger--again, a Republican from Minnesota and someone whom I talk to a lot about healthcare--wrote this piece, saying resist the bullying, dont vote for a mystery healthcare bill. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record Senator Durenbergers op-ed. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows Former GOP Senator Resist the Bullying. Dont Vote For a Mystery Health Care Bill There will be no do-overs on this. Take it from me a no vote this week is the only one that will be defensible in the years to come. What do you do when you are a U.S senator and the president wants you to vote for a health care bill that could radically change health care? You ask questions. You hold hearings. You understand what it would mean to your constituents. You listen to those who know the system. And when it doesnt add up, you vote against it. The year was 1979, and I was a freshman Republican senator from Minnesota. Inflation was driving the already high costs of health care through the roof. President Carter wanted to use Medicare and Medicaid to limit increases in hospital budgets in the face of rapidly inflating costs. Ultimately, I decided to vote against it as it would end up hurting the people of my state and was inconsistent with my beliefs. And then, after the vote, we--Democrats and Republicans--launched an effort to learn how best to change the cost curve of the entire health system by focusing on how we pay for Medicare. This week, the Senate once again is set to vote on a health care bill that will radically change how people get coverage and who can afford their care. But unlike normal times, Senators, you are being asked to approve a Motion to Proceed to a vote Without knowing what will be in the bill. Without knowing what the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office will say about the impact of major amendments and the final bill on coverage and premiums. With full knowledge that the Senate parliamentarian, who rules on what can and cant be allowed in a budget bill, has said that the Senate must remove provisions intended to prevent an insurance market death spiral Without knowing the details of the secret state Medicaid waivers the Trump administration insists will make the bill work. Without knowing how your own state budget will be impacted. Without knowing how you will defend the provisions you will only learn about later, including the payoffs and other things that will be sneaked into the bill at the last minute. Without even knowing which bill you are being asked to vote on, what the defining amendments will be and how much time you will have when being pressed for a final vote youll be stuck with. Forever. A vote in these circumstances will rightly provoke anger and distrust unlikely to abate. Take it from me A no vote on the Motion to Proceed this week is the only one that will be defensible in the years to come. I have had my arm twisted by the best of them--presidents and Senate leaders and party whips alike. I know how uncomfortable it can be. Usually, they were able to attempt a convincing argument about what is good about the bill for the country or my state. But I never would have voted for something so far reaching without knowing the answer to all the questions above. Never in all my years did I experience the level of bullying we see today. It doesnt look good in Minnesota, and I suspect it doesnt look any better in your state. I know that some of you ran for office vowing to repeal the Affordable Care Act, hoping to improve coverage and decrease costs. As public opinion polls tell us, voters do not believe this bill does the job. The good news is we havent run out of time to ask questions and to work together to fix what needs fixing if we take the time to return to regular order and hold hearings. Seven years ago, Democrats supported a bill far from Democratic orthodoxy. It did not provide for single payer, nor Medicare for all. Not even a public option. They handed Republicans a chance to build a health system that plays to our unique strengths as a nation, not to our weaknesses. As someone whose efforts earned the support of both Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W Bush to reduce health care costs without leaving anyone behind, I know our party can do much better. But it should be obvious to all of you listening to your constituents that voting on this hodgepodge of mysterious bills is not the way. Because there are no do-overs. The vote for the Motion To Proceed is likely a vote for final passage, and the House clearly stands ready to pass the Senate bill unchanged. There is no making good on all of the issues later. Once the funds for health coverage are gone, it will take new tax increases to replace them. And whats the likelihood that will happen? There will be no hiding this vote. Let me assure you, as the official scorekeeper, the Page S4150 CBO will eventually score the entire bill, and thats what your vote will be evaluated on. For those who worry about re-election politics, I can assure you that going into a campaign confident that youve done whats best for every one of your constituents, not just for those who want to stick you with a stale slogan, is the best medicine youll ever have prescribed for you. Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, there arent many votes like this in a Senators career so lets just lay this out. If you support the vote tomorrow, the following are some of the specific consequences that could follow and in many cases would follow. First, it is a vote that would open debate on bills that would undermine protections for people with preexisting conditions. This could happen in one of two ways. This vote could open debate on the potential Cruz amendment, which would allow insurance companies, as long as they offer ACA-compliant plans on the exchanges, to also sell bare-bones, skimpy plans outside of the exchanges, with almost no consumer protections. Under this amendment, insurers would be allowed to deny coverage and charge higher rates to women, older adults, and individuals with preexisting conditions. To my Republican colleagues, I ask Do you know someone who is pregnant? Do you know someone who has diabetes? Asthma? Depression? Cancer? Multiple sclerosis? Substance use disorders? Arthritis? Dementia? Sleep apnea? Parkinsons? All of these people could be denied coverage under the Cruz amendment, just as they were prior to the ACA. The Cruz amendment will also bring back annual and lifetime limits, coverage exclusions, and more. When I was campaigning in 2008, and I would go around Minnesota-- cafes, VFW halls, bars--there would be a flyer up for a family who had gone bankrupt for someone who had gotten sick. This would bring back those annual limits, those lifetime limits. Do we really want to go back to that? The Cruz amendment is intended to deceive. The amendment is designed to make people think it would lower premiums since it would allow insurers to offer stripped-down plans that dont comply with the ACAs consumer protections, but what it actually does is skyrocket the price of insurance for people with preexisting conditions like epilepsy, Crohns disease, and stroke, while eviscerating the quality of insurance for those who dont yet need, or know they need, such coverage. In fact, Americas Health Insurance Plans, which is the national political advocacy and trade association of companies that sell health insurance to Americans, and the BlueCross BlueShield Association have said this proposal is simply unworkable in any form and would undermine protections for those with preexisting medical conditions, increase premiums and lead to widespread terminations of coverage for people currently enrolled in the individual market. The fact is, these high-deductible, bare-bones plans are a dangerous rip-off, and many people will not even realize what garbage insurance they have until it is too late. Here is the thing. Even if the Cruz amendment were removed from the bill, the Better Care Reconciliation Act would still undermine protections for people with preexisting conditions. That is because the bill would allow, and even incentivize, States to waive ACA protections like the guarantee of coverage for basic essential health benefits. If you are allowed to offer plans that dont cover basic services like mental health, prescription drugs, and maternity care, then you have a backdoor channel to charge people who need those services more than those who dont. Not only that, States that seek waivers and end the guarantee of essential health benefits bring us right back into the world of annual and lifetime limits--a world where your care would end not because your doctor said so but because the insurance company would stop paying for it. This could be true even for people who get their health insurance through their employer. In fact, even if you work in a State that hasnt taken this waiver, your employer could have gotten their health insurance from a State that had. In short, with or without the Cruz amendment, the Better Care Reconciliation Act breaks President Trumps promise to protect people with preexisting conditions. Second, yes, tomorrow is a vote to end Medicaid as we know it. Medicaid is a lifeline, providing health insurance and access to care for more than 70 million Americans. That is about one in every five Americans. It includes seniors, pregnant women, people with disabilities, families with children. Senator Klobuchar was right about this being a lottery. Any of us can be in an accident. Any of us can be diagnosed at any time. Any of us can have a child who is diagnosed at any time with something unexpected. Healthcare really should be a right. I dont understand people who say I am healthy. My kids are healthy. Why should I suffer? I am the victim here. Nothing has happened to me. Why should we have a system where I am paying for people with preexisting conditions? Really? Is that the attitude my Republican colleagues are taking? Because that seems to be the logic. Medicaid had been a bedrock of our healthcare system since 1965. It was and is a Federal promise made to States and to all Americans over 50 years ago. And most of all, Medicaid works. But the Better Care Reconciliation Act would gut it. It would end the programs coverage guarantee, leaving States to either roll back coverage or slash other vital programs in order to meet their citizens needs. Finally, a vote to support the motion to proceed to this bill is a vote to drive up peoples total healthcare costs. The Republicans plans decrease or eliminate the ACAs tax credits, which help people afford their insurance--that was part of the construct--and it dramatically hikes premiums for older Americans, although ones younger than I--I am now 66, but from 50 to 64. It drives up deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs that many people have to pay in order to receive care. Americans dont like these proposals. In fact, new polling shows that only 17 percent of Americans think they and their families will be better off under the Republican plans. That is 17 percent. What Americans want is for Republicans and Democrats to work together to build on and improve the Affordable Care Act. So why do my Republican colleagues continue to push forward on these terrible bills? It doesnt have to be this way. There is another option. This body can reject the wrongheaded and ill-thought-out proposals and allow for an open, bipartisan process under regular order where we can work together and do the things the American people actually sent us here to do-- expand coverage, lower costs, and improve care. We should have bipartisan hearings where we hear from nonpartisan expert witnesses about the challenges facing the Affordable Care Act so we can work together to fix what isnt working in the ACA. What we do know from the last few years is that coverage matters. This is important. Coverage matters. Just having coverage matters. Healthcare isnt really about these big, heroic emergencies. A persons health is about some of those events, but what it is really about is having coverage and getting continuous care throughout your life. Rigorous studies have shown that for every 300 to 800 adults who get coverage, 1 life is saved per year. Research summarized by Atul Gawande and his colleagues in a recent New England Journal of Medicine piece finds that health coverage expansions have improved peoples access to care, improved their financial security, meaning fewer bankruptcies and medical bills sent to collections, improved chronic disease care and outcomes, improved self-reported health, and more. Overall, health insurance has been shown to help Americans live longer, healthier lives. Now is not the time to roll back our progress. I urge my Republican colleagues to think about what a vote for proceeding on this terrible legislation would mean for the American people. Paul Wellstone said that politics isnt about winning it isnt about money it isnt about power it is about improving peoples lives. Our constituents sent us here to improve their lives. So I urge my Republican colleagues to vote no. Lets work together to fix what needs to be fixed in the Affordable Care Act and do all we can to Page S4151 make sure people have access to affordable, high-quality healthcare when they need it. Mr. President, I yield the floor to the Senator from New Hampshire. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire. Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Minnesota for his words and his advocacy on behalf of the people of his State and all across our country. I rise today to join my colleagues and once again speak out against the Senate Republican healthcare bill and the dangerous impact it would have on the people of my home State of New Hampshire and Americans from all walks of life. This week, Senate Republicans are pressing ahead with plans that would increase health insurance costs, give Americans worse health insurance, and strip away health coverage from millions of Americans. Yet, despite statements that a vote will come tomorrow or in a matter of days, Senate Republican leadership will not tell even their own Members what proposal we will vote on, let alone hold a hearing on the impact of the bill. As version after version of this bill has emerged from behind closed doors, somehow each time it is even worse than the last, and every version would be devastating for people across New Hampshire. These bills would lead to higher costs for worse coverage. In fact, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said we would see even higher deductibles than the ones we already see. This proposal would decimate the Medicaid Program and end Medicaid expansion. It would take coverage away from millions. The Congressional Budget Office has projected that between 22 and 32 million people would lose coverage, depending on which bill we vote on. We know that rising healthcare costs are squeezing hard-working people across America. I have made clear to my colleagues across the aisle that I am willing to work with anyone who is serious about working together to build and improve on the Affordable Care Act, to lower costs, but unfortunately these Senate Republican bills would do just the opposite. Over the past months, I have heard from people all across New Hampshire. They have shared their most personal stories, their frustrations, and their fears about what will happen if this bill becomes law. Last month, Senator Shaheen and I held an emergency hearing in Concord to hear from our constituents about how proposals put forward by Senate Republicans would impact them. We held this emergency hearing at 2 p.m on a Friday afternoon in the summer, with just a days notice. Yet hundreds of people showed up, and more than 50 people got up and shared their most personal stories about the importance of healthcare, of how they have benefited from the important protections provided under current law, including maternity care, prescription drug coverage, and coverage for substance use disorder services. One of those Granite Staters was a woman named Maura from Exeter, NH. Maura told us that the Affordable Care Act has been a financial life- saver for her family. She explained to us how, when she signed up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, her premiums dropped by 750 a month because of subsidies. As Maura described it, she and her family were able to put the extra 750 each month toward childcare, food, and their mortgage. On another recent visit to Granite State Independent Living in Concord, a nonprofit that provides a range of assisted-living services for Granite Staters, I also heard about the importance of Medicaid from a Granite Stater named Terry. Terry has physical disabilities and requires the assistance of personal care aides, who are paid through Medicaid. They help her with daily tasks, such as getting up in the morning and getting dressed and preparing meals. Terry said that without the support from Medicaid, she wouldnt be able to go to work, to her job, or do basic tasks, such as shopping on her own. Without Medicaid, she would need to burden her family in order to complete everyday, basic activities, and she wouldnt be able to go to work. Terry fears that this support could be taken away under this legislation, and she is right. It could be. She said that given the cuts to Medicaid and the provisions in TrumpCare, she wouldnt get anywhere near what I need to survive. Finally, I have heard from advocates and those in recovery from substance use disorders about how vital Medicaid expansion has been in helping them get the support they need in order to get well and back on their feet. In fact, those on the front lines of this epidemic have said that Medicaid expansion is the No. 1 tool we have in order to combat the heroin, fentanyl, and opioid crisis, which is the most pressing public health and safety challenge facing my State. A few weeks ago, I visited Goodwin Community Health in Somersworth and heard from a woman named Elizabeth. At one point in her life, as a result of substance misuse disorder, Elizabeth was homeless and she had lost custody of her son. Elizabeth is now in recovery, and she works at the SOS Recovery Community Organization in Rochester, helping others get the support they need. She said that she owes her recovery to Medicaid expansion and the Affordable Care Act and that holding on to Medicaid is essential because without it, many people who are in the throes of addiction would not be able to find help. Elizabeth said I just really want to emphasize the ripple effect that recovery has on the community. Its not just because Im in recovery that I can help somebody else. Everyone around me is impacted. When we talk about the recovery revolution, its about how everyone in the community is affected when someone gets into recovery. Elizabeth is right. People who can get healthcare can get healthy, and that has a tremendous ripple effect. It lifts us all. It makes us productive and strong. At the heart of all of these stories--Maura, Terry, and Elizabeth-- and the stories that I hear all over my State is the basic fact that our communities, our families, and our entire country are better off when we give more people a chance to participate, to get the support they need, to live their lives with dignity, to contribute to our economy, and to thrive. Unfortunately, if TrumpCare becomes law, the progress we have made will be lost, insurance costs will rise, and millions of people will lose the care that they need. I am going to continue to stand with my Democratic colleagues and fight against this legislation until we defeat it once and for all. I urge the people of New Hampshire and across our beloved United States of America to continue speaking out about how this legislation would impact their lives. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr. Perdue. The Senator from Vermont. Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I do not know--and I dont know if anyone knows--whether the Republican so-called healthcare legislation will pass tomorrow, whether the beginning of the debate will take place or whether it will not. I dont know that, but this I do know. The legislation being proposed--and by the way, we still dont know what that legislation is. In general, what we do know is that the legislation being proposed is the cruelest, most destructive, and irresponsible piece of legislation ever brought to the U.S Senate in the modern history of our country. I know the media focuses on, do the Republicans have the votes, how is this Senator going to vote, how is that Senator going to vote? All of that is interesting to those of us inside the beltway. The far more important issue--which we dont discuss enough the media doesnt cover enough--is what this legislation actually would do if it were implemented. Right now, unique among major countries on Earth, we do not guarantee healthcare to all people as a right. The result of that is that we now have today--before this disastrous legislation--28 million Americans who have no health insurance and even more who have high deductibles and high copayments, preventing them from getting to a doctor when they should. We have a bad situation now. It is better today than before the Affordable Care Act was passed, when we had over Page S4152 50 million people without insurance, but no one suggested what we have today is where we should be. Yet we have 28 million people uninsured. The Republican solution to this problem is to throw another 22 million people off of the health insurance that they currently have. I want the American people to, for one moment, put themselves in the place of someone tonight who may be watching what we are talking about here, who has cancer, who has heart disease, who has diabetes or some other life-threatening illness. Millions of people are in that position. They are struggling for their lives right now. They are under treatment. They are thinking, what happens if this Republican bill is passed? Will I live and continue to get the treatment that I need or will I die? I think there are very few Members of the Senate who have met with their constituents on this issue, who have not seen people break into tears, asking What is going to happen to me or my children or my parents? We did a teleconference townhall a few weeks ago in Vermont. We had some 16,000 people on the line, and a woman whose kid has a very, very serious illness called. The cost of the prescription drugs are off the chart. She asked What is going to happen to my child if this bill goes through? Do you know what? I didnt have the guts to tell her what might happen to her child. I dont want to be on the phone telling any person in Vermont or in America that their child might die because of the legislation that might proceed tomorrow. This legislation would cut Medicaid by almost 800 billion over a 10- year period, taking healthcare away from lower income and working-class families, including many children with special needs, kids with Down syndrome, kids who have serious emotional problems, kids whose lives now depend on Medicaid. When you cut Medicaid by 800 billion, many of those children will lose coverage entirely or receive significantly fewer benefits. This legislation, when we cut Medicaid by 800 billion, will have a severe and dramatic impact on nursing homes all over America. A lot of people dont know this, but if your mom has Alzheimers and is in a nursing home or your dad has a terminal illness and is in a nursing home, guess what Medicaid pays almost two-thirds of the costs associated with nursing home care in America. What happens to the people in nursing homes when you slash Medicaid? How many of them will get thrown out of the nursing homes? Where do they go? Are families in America, working-class families, going to be forced to make the choice of whether they take care of their parents or whether they send their kids to college? Those are the choices that working-class families may have to make if this horrific legislation gets passed. This legislation would dramatically decrease funding for the opioid and heroin epidemic that is sweeping this country, including my State of Vermont, including Kentucky, West Virginia, New Hampshire, Ohio, and States all over the country that are struggling with the opioid addiction problem. The program that provides the most funding to help deal with addiction treatment and addiction prevention happens to be Medicaid. What happens to our efforts to try to get a handle on this terrible, terrible epidemic sweeping our country when you make massive cuts to Medicaid? I found it amusing that when Donald Trump ran for President--oh, he was a great friend of the working class. He was going to stand up for the working class. Let me mention to workers all over this country who are in their sixties that if this legislation passes, your premiums are going to go up dramatically. That is one of the reasons the AARP strongly opposes this legislation. If you live in Baltimore, for example, where I was this morning, speaking to the NAACP--in Baltimore, if you are 60 years of age and you make 40,000 a year, your average health insurance premiums will go up from about 4,000 a year now to 8,800 per year, more than double. If you are a 62-year-old worker, making 40,000 a year--not a lot of money--how are you going to pay that? Remember, all that Donald Trump said about what a great friend of the working class he was. This legislation would defund Planned Parenthood. I get a kick out of hearing my Republican friends talk about choice, freedom. Oh, my goodness, they love choice and freedom. They want the American people to go to any place they want to go. It is all about what America is about. Two and a half million women have made a choice, and the choice they have made is that they want to get their healthcare from Planned Parenthood. That choice, that freedom would be taken away from them, starting tomorrow, if this legislation is passed. When you think about insurance, you think that insurance is about covering you in your time of need. Before the Affordable Care Act was passed, many millions of the American people could not get the health insurance they needed to address their particular healthcare crisis. If you had a heart disease, if you had breast cancer, if you had diabetes, the insurance companies would say We are in the business of making money. Why on Gods Earth would we want to insure you if you had breast cancer 5 years ago and it is possible it might recur? That is a losing proposition for us. That is what insurance companies want to do. They are not in the business of providing healthcare. They are in the business of making money. They denied, unbelievably--think about how crazy this is they actually would deny coverage to people who had preexisting conditions. I have problems with the Affordable Care Act. It is far, far from perfect. It did end that obscenity of allowing insurance companies not to cover people who had preexisting conditions--something that is quite unbelievable. Guess what. If this legislation is passed, in all likelihood, many people in this country with preexisting conditions will not be able to get healthcare that they need at a price they can afford. We dont quite know how many of them will die. Nobody can make that prediction. I want to read for you a very interesting article that appeared from an institution called PolitiFact. PolitiFact is an entity that tries to keep a check on what politicians say. They look at you and you make a statement, and they say Is this true or is this guy not telling the truth? I was on a TV program called Meet the Press a number of weeks ago. I said Well, you know, if this Republican legislation is passed, thousands of Americans will die. And my Republican colleagues and the rightwing media said Bernie Sanders is engaging in hyperbole. He is exaggerating. Who wants to see anybody die? I know nobody here wants to see anybody die. Of course not. No Republican does. No Democrat does. No Independent does. But we have to look at the consequences of what we do. So what PolitiFact did was take a look at the studies to see whether I was telling the truth. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the PolitiFact article be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows From www.politifact.com, June 27, 2017 Bernie Sanders Projection of Thousands of Deaths From Lost Health Coverage Is Well-Supported By Louis Jacobson During an interview on NBCs Meet the Press, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-VT., didnt hold back in his criticism of Republican efforts to roll back the Affordable Care Act He said such legislative efforts will literally be deadly. What the Republican proposal in the House does is throw 23 million Americans off of health insurance, Sanders told host Chuck Todd. What a part of Harvard University--the scientists there--determine is when you throw 23 million people off of health insurance, people with cancer, people with heart disease, people with diabetes, thousands of people will die. Sanders continued, I wish I didnt have to say it. This is not me. This is study after study making this point. It is common sense. Even if it seems like common sense that insurance would save lives, would it be on the scale of thousands, as Sanders said? And would legitimate studies show that? studying the studies When we contacted Sanders office, spokesman Josh Miller- Lewis cited two sources. One is the Harvard study Sanders mentioned--published on June 22, 2017, by the liberal Center for American Progress. It was Page S4153 coauthored by a Harvard professor of social epidemiology two medical students who graduated from Harvards T.H Chan School of Public Health, and two policy specialists at the Center for American Progress. To come up with their estimates, the authors of the Harvard-Center for American Progress report adapted the results of a peer-reviewed 2014 study of the Massachusetts state health care law--a law that was a model for the Affordable Care Act. The 2014 study was lead-authored by Harvard professor Benjamin D. Sommers. The Harvard-Center for American Progress study projected that there would be one excess death for every 830 people who lose coverage as a result of the AHCA. Using Congressional Budget Office projections of the impact of the House version of the bill, the authors estimated an additional 217,000 deaths over the next decade, or 21,700 per year. The second piece of evidence Sanders office cited was an op-ed by yet more health policy specialists who are affiliated with Harvard--David Himmelstein and Steffie Woolhandler, who are professors of public health at Hunter College-City University of New York as well as lecturers at Harvard Medical School. The op-ed--published on Jan. 23, 2017, well before either chambers Republican health care bill was introduced--used as its basis a different study lead-authored by Sommers. This 2012 study tracked what happened after states expanded Medicaid. Adapting the findings of the 2012 study to a scenario in which 20 million Americans lost coverage--which turned out to be lower than what the CBO found for the House bill-- Himmelstein and Woolhandler estimated that there would be 43,956 deaths annually due to the GOPs health policy changes. Its worth noting, however, that both of these projections come from the ideological left. As we noted, the Center for American Progress is a liberal think tank. And Himmelstein and Woolhandler are founders of Physicians for a National Health Program, a group that advocates for single-payer national health insurance--a proposal that is even further to the left than the Affordable Care Act. So can Sanders assertion be supported by the peer-reviewed literature alone? What prior studies say In our previous fact-checking of this issue, we found at least seven academic papers that detected a link between securing health insurance and a decline in mortality. Heres a rundown. In 2002, a panel of more than a dozen medical specialists convened by the federally chartered Institute of Medicine estimated that 18,000 Americans had died in 2000 because they were uninsured. In January 2008, Stan Dorn, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute, published a paper that sought to update the IOM study with newer data. Replicating the studys methodology, Dorn concluded that the figure should be increased to 22,000. A 2009 American Journal of Public Health study concluded that a lack of health insurance is associated with as many as 44,789 deaths in the United States, more than those caused by kidney disease. Three studies looked at state-level expansions of Medicaid and in each case found significant improvements in mortality after such expansions of coverage. These include a 2012 New England Journal of Medicine study of New York, Maine, and Arizona by Harvard researchers, and a 2014 study of Massachusetts by researchers from Harvard and the Urban Institute. These were the two articles that formed the basis of the analyses cited by Sanders staff. A 2014 study published by the blog of the health policy publication Health Affairs looked at states that, at the time, had declined to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. It estimated that the 25 states studied would have collectively avoided between 7,000 and 17,000 deaths. A 2014 study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology found improved survival rates for young adults with cancer after securing insurance under the Affordable Care Act. A 2017 study in the journal Medical Care looked at a provision of the Affordable Care Act that allows young adults to be covered under a parents policy. The study found a decline in mortality among this population from diseases amenable to preventive treatment. Mortality from trauma, such as car accidents, saw no decrease, as would be expected. We found two papers with results that were more equivocal. A paper published in April 2009 in HSR Health Services Research. In it, Richard Kronick of the Department of Family and Preventive Medicine at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine, raised questions about the conclusions of the seminal Institute of Medicine study from 2002. Kronicks study adjusted the data--as the IOM had not-- for a number of demographic and health factors, including status as a smoker and body mass index, and found that doing so removed the excess number of deaths found in the original study. A 2013 paper in the New England Journal of Medicine coauthored by Katherine Baicker of Harvard University compared about 6,000 patients in Oregon who got coverage through a 2008 Medicaid expansion and about 6,000 who didnt. While the study found improvements in out-of-pocket medical spending and lower rates of depression among those who got coverage, key benchmarks for physical health--including blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar--did not improve in such patients. But even the two lead authors of the more equivocal studies have told us that the scholarly record demonstrates that having health insurance saves lives, and that not having insurance can lead to additional deaths. We asked several of the authors of these papers whether they believe Sanders assertion of thousands of deaths is generally supported by the scholarly evidence. We heard back from three of them.  Thousands is completely fair, Dorn said. Baicker agreed. It is of course difficult to pin down an exact number of deaths that would be caused by a specific new policy, she said. But a number like thousands does not seem unreasonable, based on the available evidence. And Sommers--whose work formed the indirect basis of the studies cited by Sanders--concurred. I agree that its challenging to pin down an exact number on this, Sommers said. But overall, the academic evidence certainly gets you into the range of thousands of deaths per year. Our ruling Sanders said, When you throw 23 million people off of health insurance--people with cancer, people with heart disease, people with diabetes--thousands of people will die. . . . This is study after study making this point. Sanders statement on Meet the Press was phrased generally enough to be defensible. We found ample evidence in the academic literature to suggest that legislation on the scale of the House bill would produce thousands of additional deaths. That said, we cant say with any specificity how many deaths will occur. Its important to note that the studies provide estimates only, and each study found a slightly different result. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True. Mr. SANDERS. One of the studies my office cited was published on June 22, 2017, by the Center for American Progress. It was coauthored by a Harvard professor of social epidemiology, two medical students who graduated from Harvards T.H Chan School of Public Health, and two policy specialists at the Center for American Progress. I wont go through all of the details, but I will say this, quoting from PolitiFact The Harvard-Center for American Progress study projected that there would be one excess death for every 830 people who lose coverage as a result of the AHCA. The Republican bill. Using Congressional Budget Office projections of the impact of the House version of the bill, the authors estimated an additional 217,000 deaths over the next decade, or 21,700 per year. That is not Bernie Sanders that is a study done at Harvard. The second piece of evidence Sanders office cited was an op-ed by yet more health policy specialists who are affiliated with Harvard--David Himmelstein and Steffie Woolhandler, who are professors of public health at Hunter College-City University of New York as well as lecturers at Harvard Medical School. Adapting the findings of the 2012 study to a scenario in which 20 million Americans lost coverage--which turned out to be lower than what the CBO found for the House bill-- They estimated 23 million would lose coverage-- Himmelstein and Woolhandler estimated that there would be 43,956 deaths annually due to the GOPs health policy changes. Quoting again from PolitiFact So can Sanders assertion be supported by the peer-reviewed literature alone? Then they cite some studies. In 2002, a panel of more than a dozen medical specialists convened by the federally chartered Institute of Medicine estimated that 18,000 Americans had died in the year 2000 because they were uninsured. In January 2008, Stan Dorn, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute, published a paper that sought to update the IOM study with newer data. Replicating the studys methodology, Dorn concluded that the figure should be increased to 22,000. A 2009 American Journal of Public Health study concluded that a lack of health insurance is associated with as many as 44,789 deaths in the United States, more than those caused by kidney disease. And on and on it goes. This is not Bernie Sanders talking this is scientific and medical study after medical study saying what is obvious--that if you have a life-threatening disease and cannot get healthcare, you will die. So I would hope that my Republican colleagues, as they vote tomorrow, understand the consequences of their vote. I know no Republican--nobody here--wants to see anybody die, but when you take 23 million people off of the health insurance they have, many thousands of those people will die. I think most Americans would think that when you are dealing with an Page S4154 issue like healthcare, which impacts, by definition, every single person in our country, and when you are dealing with an issue that impacts about one-sixth of the American economy--over 3 trillion a year--that you just might want to have some serious discussions on that issue. You might want to ask--here is a radical idea--doctors what they think about this legislation. What is it going to mean to their patients? Wow, that is a pretty radical idea when dealing with healthcare for all the American people. You might want to have one hearing, maybe, and say to doctors Doctors, what do you think about this bill? What about hospitals? How will this bill impact hospitals, especially rural hospitals in Vermont, Virginia, and all across this country? You might want to talk to a hospital administrator. You might want to talk to a patient advocate, maybe somebody from the American Cancer Society or somebody who is active in the diabetes effort. You just might want to talk to the experts on healthcare as to how this legislation might impact the work they do. But, amazingly, in an unprecedented way, this legislation was written behind closed doors. I think it was 12, 13 Republican Senators who wrote this bill. Most Republican Senators dont even know what is in this bill, let alone Democrats and let alone the American people. How do you write legislation that impacts every American, one-sixth of the economy, and not have one public hearing to hear from those most knowledgeable about healthcare in America? But that is exactly what the Republican leadership has done. I know why they did that. It is not a secret. If you had a horrific piece of legislation, trust me, you would want as little public discussion as possible. You would try to hide what this bill does. I understand that. Yet, despite all of that, it turns out that virtually every major healthcare organization in America opposes this bill. I dont know how you can go forward with legislation that has had zero public hearings, that is opposed overwhelmingly by the American people--last poll that I saw from USA TODAY had 12 percent support for this legislation--and go forward with legislation opposed by every major healthcare organization in America. This bill is opposed by the AARP, the largest senior group in America. It is opposed by the American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association, the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Psychiatric Association, the Federation of American Hospitals, the Catholic Health Association, the American Lung Association, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the March of Dimes, the National MS society and the American Nurses Association. In other words, virtually every major healthcare organization does not want to see this bill passed. The American people overwhelmingly do not want to see this bill passed. So how come it might pass? People dont want it. Healthcare organizations dont want it. Who wants it? I will tell how wants it-- people who are going to get tax breaks. They think it is a great idea. Billionaires who got 200 billion in tax breaks from the House bill think it is an extraordinary idea. So what if 23 million people lose their health insurance from the House bill. The top one percent will get 200 billion in tax breaks. Large healthcare corporations like it. The insurance companies and the drug companies are going to get a combined hundreds of billions of dollars. I will tell you who else likes it those people associated with the Koch brothers who are spending hundreds of millions of dollars on elections. They like it because their ideology, their philosophy is that government should play no role in the concerns of the American people. Mark my words--if this bill, which would cut Medicaid by 800 billion, passes, Medicare will be next. And in the House, they have already passed legislation that would voucherize Medicare. Social Security will not be far behind. That is the ideology of the Koch brothers and the people who fund the Republican Party. Their concern is with large campaign contributors, not the American people. I hope very much that tomorrow when we assemble here--I gather in the afternoon--for a vote, the Republicans will think more about people in their own State, about their children, the elderly, the sick, and not just about their campaign contributors. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin. Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise this evening to help deliver a message from American families to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. The American people have sent a clear message to Washington. The message is that they do not want us to go forward with this partisan--and mean--healthcare repeal bill. But, incredibly, we are today about to embark on a vote to do the exact opposite. What is happening in Washington this week is that we are completely ignoring the message that Wisconsinites and the hard-working American families across this country have sent for us to hear. Havent you been listening? To my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, have you been listening to the calls pouring in from families in your States? Have you been listening to the voices of parents and their children, the schoolteachers and doctors, and the working people who are daily struggling to get ahead? These messages have been sent to Washington. They have been sent loudly and for too many months--in fact, for too many months for you to possibly not have heard them. The American people dont want to pay more for less care. They dont want the age tax or the higher premiums this plan is offering. People with preexisting conditions dont want to be thrown into a high-risk pool or priced out of the coverage they have today. They dont want bare-bones insurance that doesnt cover the essential services and lifesaving care they may need. They dont want their loved ones who depend on Medicare for nursing home care or their disabled children who rely on Medicaid funding at school to have their care put at risk through caps and cuts. The American people dont want a plan that will make things worse. It is hard for me to believe that Washington hasnt heard this message because I have been listening. I have been listening to people like Jean. Jean is from Baraboo, WI. She told me that she is scared because her Crohns disease would cost her a fortune if her preexisting conditions were not covered. She told me that she needs the healthcare she has today because my husband ruptured a disk in his back that prevented him from getting a job that promised us coverage. So now he works multiple jobs. I have been listening to Mary from Kenosha, WI. I met with Mary recently, and she told me about her son Kyle. Kyle, at a young age, was diagnosed on the autism spectrum and was never expected to learn to even speak. When Kyle was 7, medical professionals spoke with Mary and said that Kyle might have to be removed from his home and left to be cared for in an institution. But Mary had hope, and thanks to Medicaid, Kyle was able to receive some very specialized medical therapy for his autism, and he was able to remain at home. He was able to receive an education. He was able to get his drivers license, and now Kyle is attending college. Mary is terrified, nonetheless, that this bills drastic cuts to Medicaid would rob Kyle of the care he needs to achieve the independence that he has worked so hard for during his entire life. Mary told me about her concern for so many other families with similar situations. I have been listening to Greg. Greg is from Stoddard, WI. He has no idea how he and other older Wisconsinites will be able to afford higher costs for healthcare. Gregs sons, both of whom have diabetes, are already struggling with skyrocketing insulin prices. I have been listening to the Schaumberg family in Seymour, WI. Their daughter Zoe was born with a congenital heart defect. She had to have open heart surgery at 5 days of age. Now, Zoe is guaranteed coverage without being denied or charged more, but Zoes parents are scared that this repeal plan will make things worse. When Zoes mom, Chelsey Schaumberg, was told about how this plan would weaken the guaranteed protections and care that people have today, she said Page S4155 this in her letter to me To me, its like theyre taking the American Dream from her . . . kids in Wisconsin with preexisting conditions . . . are counting on you to protect that right. This isnt right. This isnt fair. It is not who we are. If my colleagues who have been drafting this plan behind closed doors have not been listening to the messages of fear and anxiety from the American people, maybe they will listen to why this proposal is very personal to me. When I was 9 years old, I got sick. I got really sick. I was in the hospital for 3 months. Following getting out of the hospital, I required significant followup care for nearly a year before I regained my full strength and fully recovered. But when it came to health insurance, it was like I had a scarlet letter. My grandparents, who raised me, couldnt find a policy that would cover me, not from any insurer and not at any price. They had to pay for my care out of pocket, and I can tell you they made some major sacrifices to do so, all because I was a child who had been branded with those terrifying words preexisting condition. So what are we doing here? It is time to stop the partisan nonsense. The people of Wisconsin did not send me to Washington to take away peoples healthcare. They sent me to fight for people like Zoe, Kyle, and Jean. What I hear from people in Wisconsin is that they want us working together to protect the care people have and to make it more affordable. We should be working together to lower costs like skyrocketing prescription drug prices. We should be working together to strengthen the insurance market and give people more options. But we should not be working on partisan repeal legislation that will make things worse, that will leave millions uninsured, that will make healthcare more expensive, and that will price families out of the care they have today. It is time we listened to the messages that are being sent to Washington. It is time we worked together across the partisan aisle to do our jobs--the jobs the American people sent us here to do on their behalf. I hope the congressional majority will join me and my colleagues to work together to strengthen healthcare and to move our country forward. I thank the body. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia. Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Wisconsin and also my colleague from Vermont. Their words have been very powerful. I also rise to talk about healthcare. We are told in the Senate that tomorrow we vote, but we dont know what we will be voting on. We will bring up a House bill that, by virtually every account, is not going to be the bill that we will be voting on, but we dont yet know which version of healthcare we will be voting on if we proceed to the debate. It is like a three-card monte game. There are all sorts of different versions that are out there on the table. One version would take health insurance away from 22 million people, one from 25 million, and one from 32 million, and we are not being told which one we will vote on. When I was a kid, there was a TV show we used to watch, Lets Make a Deal. One of the features of the show was this What is behind door No. 1, and what is behind door No. 2? The contestants would have the opportunity to pick. One would be great, and one would be a disaster. That was the fun of the game show What is behind door No. 1? What is behind door No. 2? But this isnt about a game show. We are not participating in a game show. We are participating in a decision about the most important aspect of any persons life--their health--and about the most important expenditure they ever make with a dollar--a healthcare expenditure--and about the largest sector of the American economy--healthcare. Instead of treating the issue with the gravity it deserves, there is a secret plan and a mystery vote without any hearings, shutting out the committees, including the HELP Committee, where I serve, shutting out the minority party, which represents 48 of the 100 Senators in this body, and, most importantly, shutting out the public. As the Senator from Vermont mentioned, in this body, the greatest deliberative body in the world, we have not had a single hearing. We have not heard from a single doctor, a single patient, a single hospital, a single nurse, a single insurance company, or a single medical innovator. We are about to take a vote on the most important expenditure in anyones life and the largest sector in the American economy following a completely closed process where it has been the will of the majority to keep the door shut. This isnt a game show. Let me tell you how real this is. I did something on Friday that I often do. I started doing this in 2002. I live in Richmond, but I drive a number of hours to Wise County, VA, which is a county on the border between Virginia and Kentucky. It is a county where my wifes family is from. She grew up in Roanoke, but her dad is from Big Stone Gap, VA, in Wise County, right across the border from Pike and Hazard Counties in Kentucky. There is a fairground in Wise--the Virginia-Kentucky fairgrounds. Back in the late 1990s, a Catholic nun, Sister Bernie, and two other wonderful nurses who have become friends--Teresa and Paula--decided to try to offer healthcare for people who didnt have health insurance at this county fairground. They just set up with a few volunteers, and they said If you live in Appalachia, if you dont have health insurance, if you need medical care or dental care, just come and we will see what we can do. They do this every July, for one weekend a year. Here is what this has grown into. I first went when I was Lieutenant Governor in 2002. People start to arrive. I have talked about this on the floor. I just did it Friday, and I want to share some stories. They start to arrive Tuesday or Wednesday in cars. They camp in the campground. Now, it is July, and this weekend was the hottest weekend in the summer. They start camping with their kids, often in cars. Some are sleeping in cars. Some are throwing blankets out on the lawn next to a chain-link fence. They wait in the tens, in the dozens, in the fifties, in the hundreds. Then they open the door at 6 a.m It is Friday morning, and the people who have waited for days come in and get a number to see if they can get healthcare on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday from volunteer doctors in the richest Nation and the most compassionate Nation in the world. When they opened the door on Friday morning, I was down there. I do what I do. I go and I work the registration booth, and I talk to people and register them so they can get healthcare. I got there a little late. They had opened the door at 6 a.m , and I got there 8 a.m They had already given out numbers to 1,200 people in the first 2 hours. Over the course of the weekend, they serve thousands of people. They come in to get dental care. For most of them, their teeth are too far gone. So it is just a matter of pulling their teeth. Some come in to have most of their teeth pulled, and then they can get dentures. They get an eye exam and find out Wow, I should have gotten glasses 5 or 10 years ago. No wonder I have been such a poor student all the way through school, or no wonder I have had such a hard time on my job. I needed glasses. They get a cancer screening. Sometimes they get something caught early, and sometimes they get something caught very late. It is an amazing spectacle. It is uplifting because of the volunteers who turn out--doctors, dental hygienists, nurses, and the Lions Club, which comes to do vision screenings. That is uplifting. It is depressing and it is heartbreaking to see people sleeping up against chain-linked fences and sleeping crunched over in their car for days so that they can get a little bit of free healthcare in the richest Nation on Earth. When I work the registration booth, I have to ask people a series of questions so that they know who they can go see when they are there. I worked the booth for about an hour and a half. Here is a question you ask everybody How long has it been since you have seen a doctor? How long has it been since you have seen a doctor? I had a mother of four kids. The kids were 12 and under, and they were sort Page S4156 of buzzing around. The mom was sitting in a chair. You know what happens if you are a mom with kids that young. Your kids pick up something in school. They bring it home, and you get sick. This is what happens to parents. I have a colleague here with young kids, and he knows what I am talking about. I asked the mother How long has it been since you have seen a doctor? I am not really sure. So I was kind of going through my checklist. Have you seen a doctor within the last year? No, not within the last year. Have you seen a doctor within the last 2 years? Not within the last 2 years. Have you seen a doctor within the last 3 years? I might have seen a doctor in the last 3 years. That was a mother of four young kids. I had somebody sitting across from me, and I asked her another common question Are you employed? You ask everybody this. Part-time? Full- time? I am not employed, but I am about to get my nursing license back. Well, that is interesting. So you are in healthcare. Well, I used to be. I am about to get my nursing license back. Well, what happened? Now, this wasnt on the questionnaire, but I couldnt resist asking her What happened? Well, I was a nurse. I had a great career. I had a great life. But then a doctor prescribed me opioids for arthritis, and the bottom fell out of my life. I got addicted to opioids, and I lost my license, and I lost virtually everything in my life. Now I am unemployed, but I am working as a counselor at a church, trying to help people who are also opioid addicted. I am about to get my license back, but I am not working yet, and I dont have insurance yet, and that is why, even though I am a nurse and I am a healthcare professional, I have waited in line for a couple of days to come get healthcare. There was a woman from Maryland who had been laid off as a supervisor at McDonalds a number of months ago. She was unemployed. She had horrible dental problems that were way past being solved. She just needed to get a bunch of her teeth pulled to ease her pain. So get what this woman did. This is about an 8 or 9 hour drive from her house. When her teeth got so bad and so painful after her firing and she needed to have her teeth pulled, she couldnt go anywhere. She didnt have anybody to do it. She said I think there is this free clinic in Appalachia. Now, it is a couple of months out. So I am going to have to suffer through the pain for a while, but I also have to save up some money. She saved up her money like most people would try to save money for a summer vacation. She saved up her money so she could put enough gas in the car and pay for one night at a hotel and so she could drive for 9 hours to Wise County, VA, and wait in the line for days and come and get a bunch of her teeth pulled in the richest and most compassionate Nation on Earth. By the way, I had another guy, and I asked him the question What are you here for? Are you here for medical services, are you here for dental services or are you here for vision services? He said I am actually here for all three, but the problem is, it is the hottest day of the year. It is 95 and humid, and I am so sick, I cant sit out in the Sun all day. So I got to do two out of three. I cant do all three. I said Which are the two worst, is it the medical and dental or vision and dental or vision and medical? He said Look, I will do dental and medical, but even though I have glasses and I need to get an upgrade, I cant wait around because I am so sick out in the hot Sun for so long. So you are just going to have to give me two out of the three. I cant wait all weekend. I cant wait all day in this dusty fairground on the 21st of July to get healthcare. These people need us. They need us to be at our best. They need us to be thinking about them. The first time I went to this clinic in Wise, I was struck by the magnanimity of the volunteers, I was struck by the need, but what really hit me was when I went into the parking lot. I expected to see cars from Virginia and Kentucky because Kentucky is 10 miles away from the fairgrounds. I might have expected to see cars from West Virginia, which is 100 miles away, or Tennessee, which is 40 miles away, but North Carolina is 150 miles away, South Carolina is 350 miles away, Georgia is 400 miles away, Alabama is farther, and Oklahoma is farther. People drive from all over the Southeast in the United States, in the richest nation on Earth, in the most compassionate Nation on Earth, to wait for days in a dusty campground in the heat of the hottest part of the summer so they can have their teeth pulled because they dont have healthcare. The Affordable Care Act has cut the uninsurance rate to one of the lowest in recorded history, but we havent gone far enough. We have to do better by these people who are sleeping in their cars or up against chain-link fences, who are traveling for 9 hours to get their teeth pulled, not worse. We want to have fewer people like this and fewer folks who need to do this, not more. The vote we are going to have about whether it is 22 million or 25 million or 32 million people who lose health insurance, that is going the wrong way. We have to go a different way. We have to do better, not worse. Most of the things we talk about in this Chamber are about issues. This isnt about issues, this is about who we are. This is about who we are as Senators. This is about who we are as Americans. This is about who we are as thinking, feeling, breathing, believing human beings. It is about who we are. A great teacher, a great teacher once laid out the yardstick I was sick and you took care of me. That is one version of the New Testament. There are other phraseologies from the 25th chapter of Matthew I was sick and you visited me. I was sick and you cared for me. I was sick and you looked after me. The Teacher basically says, the way you treat someone who is sick is the way you treat the Creator. It is important to be compassionate to somebody who is sick, and anybody who is hearing these words, you dont have to think for a second to think about somebody in your family who is suffering from cancer or dementia or mental illness or who has been the victim of an accident. There are faces appearing in your minds right now because we all have this in our families. The way we treat people who are sick is not just a measure of us, it is a measure of what we think about the Creator. When a great teacher said, I was sick and you took care of me, he was giving an instruction to us about the way we should behave. In the last week, I am struck by the fact that this body has been jolted by the news about two of our colleagues, both of whom who have had cancer diagnoses. Last week, we were shocked and saddened to hear about our colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, who is my chairman on the Armed Services Committee who is suffering a very tough form of cancer, and cancer is going to find a match in Senator McCain. This touches us in this body. A week or two before, we heard about another colleague on the Armed Services Committee who sits next to me at every committee hearing, Senator Hirono, who just announced she has kidney cancer and just underwent surgery. I was chatting on the floor with her earlier tonight. I dont think she would mind me saying, she is strong and she is a fighter, like Senator McCain is a fighter, but she is worried about it just like Senator McCain would be. This touches everyone. It touches the powerful, it touches the powerless. It touches the wealthy, it touches the poor. It touches men, it touches women. It touches the young, it touches the old. It touches everyone, and the way we treat people who are sick, the way we treat people who are anxious about their health is the way we treat the Creator. That is what we are taught. So lets live up to that standard. Why would we do otherwise? Why are we here? Why did we run? Why do we serve? What do people expect of us? I was sick, and you cared for me. I was sick, and you visited me. I was sick, and you looked after me. I was sick, and you took care of me. Is it that hard? Is it so important to rush it through and not have hearings and not have committees and not engage the Democrats and not listen to Page S4157 the people sleeping against chain-link fences or driving 9 hours to get their teeth pulled? We cant afford to get this wrong, and the talent of the people in this body convinces me beyond a shadow of a doubt that if we take the time, we can get this right. If we can get this right, why will we not take the time to get this right? So I would plead with my colleagues, lets stand together on behalf of the sick, lets stand together on behalf of those who are counting on us. Another part of the New Testament is the Letter of Paul to the Hebrews Because we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, we have got to do the right thing. We are surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses who want us to do the right thing, and I know we can, and I pray we will. With that Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut. Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I was really glad to be on the floor to hear the remarks of my great friend Senator Kaine. It is gut-check time in the U.S Senate. The legislation we are going to consider tomorrow would hurt a lot of people in ways I think that are very hard to fathom. One of our colleagues said I didnt come here to hurt people. Everybody came here with designs on how to make their community, their State, their Nation a better place, and we are on the verge of taking a vote on a bill that objectively will rain a level of devastation down on this country that is really hard to fathom. I cant match Senator Kaines eloquence talking about the personal stakes here. We take for granted the fact that as employees of the U.S Senate, we get a health benefit that makes sure that if we do fall ill or if our children fall ill, we will not have to think about whether we have the money to be able to afford treatment, but that is not how it is for all of those families who lined up in Virginia to receive care. That is not how it is for those who come to a similar event in Connecticut that is targeted just for dental services but has a line that begins the night before and is oversubscribed before the event begins the next morning. That is not how it was for the millions of American families who used to go bankrupt because, when faced between a choice of personal financial ruin and the death of a child or a loved one, they chose financial ruin. Until you have been faced with that choice, I dont think there is any way to understand it. It certainly is a choice no one in this Chamber will ever have to make. In Connecticut, the Burger family made that choice. Before the Affordable Care Act was passed, in the 2-week period of time where Mr. Burger didnt have healthcare insurance, their son was diagnosed with cancer, and when he got on his new plan, it was a preexisting condition so it wasnt covered, and the Burger family lost everything. They went through their savings account. They lost their house. They went bankrupt. They were one of thousands and thousands of families who made that choice. That rarely happens any longer. The number of personal bankruptcies in this country has been cut in half because of the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act hasnt made healthcare magically affordable for everyone, but it has meant that people dont have to make that choice any longer. The scope of the pain we are talking about, if any of the three versions of this bill get the vote, is really hard to fathom. Under the original version of the bill, 23 million people would lose insurance. I amended this chart when a series of changes were made at the last minute that CBO scored to reduce that number to 22 million, but this is the entire population of Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota and West Virginia, all losing healthcare at the same time, and the majority of that happens in the first year. So of the 22 million, 14 or 15 million of those people lose insurance next year. The scope of that devastation--12 months from now, 15 million less people having insurance, 15 million more people showing up in emergency rooms to get care--is something I dont think any of my colleagues really can get their head wrapped around. For all the times President Trump said the Affordable Care Act is dead, that ObamaCare is in a death spiral, that is not true. It is a lie. It is a lie because the Congressional Budget Office says the death spiral only occurs if you pass any of the versions of the legislation we are considering that if the Affordable Care Act stays in place, 28 million people will not have insurance--which is far too many--but if one of these bills go into effect, at the end of 10 years, we will have 50 million people without insurance. A new report from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that the ACA markets are not collapsing despite what the White House says--despite the lies they perpetuate. Early results from 2017 suggest the individual market is stabilizing and insurers in this market are regaining profitability. Insurer financial results show no sign of a market collapse. That is the Kaiser Family Foundations finding which mirrors the finding of CBO. The collapse in our insurance market only happens if one of these bills pass, and it is not just the number of people who lose healthcare. The folks we should care most about--the people who are making just enough money so they dont qualify for Federal programs but not enough money that they can save for retirement and pay for their kids college bills and do all the things you need to do in order to lead a respectable life--those people are going to be hurt worst by this bill. If you are a 64-year-old getting ready for Medicare coverage, you are making 56,000 a year, you are going to pay 170 percent more under this bill just in your premiums, never mind the extra money you are going to pay in copays and deductibles. The CBO says that if these bills are passed, a single policyholder who purchases a plan at a 58-percent actuarial value in 2026 would have a deductible of roughly 13,000 for medical and drug expenses combined, which is absolutely unaffordable. By every metric, whether it be the amount of money that you pay or the number of people who do not have healthcare coverage, the CBO answers this question Who gets hurt under the GOP healthcare plan? Pretty clearly, everybody, unless you are an insurance company, a drug company, or rich. If you are affluent and you can afford your own healthcare, you will be fine. If you are an insurance company or a drug company, you are going to get a big tax cut out of this. But everyone else will get hurt and get hurt really badly. I have watched my Republican friends process this information. I have watched them, largely, stay silent. The Democrats are the only people on the floor of the Senate these days who are talking about healthcare. Most of my Republican friends are not willing to come down and defend any of these products, but those who have been have shifted their rationale. Republicans who have been willing to come down and defend their plan concede that millions and millions of people will lose insurance, and they concede that rates will go up for most Americans. So they cling to one last value that underpins the Republicans healthcare plan. In their words, that value is freedom--the freedom not to be insured. The Republicans suggest that you should not really worry about 32 million people losing insurance because those people really did not want insurance and now they will be free not to have it. That is just not what the CBO says. The CBO says that millions and millions of these people who will lose insurance desperately want it they are just not going to be able to afford it. It is also not true that the bill grants that kind of freedom. Insurance is compulsory under the Republican healthcare plan just like it is under the Democratic plan. It is just compulsory in a different way. The Republican plan says that as a penalty for not having insurance, you will be banned from purchasing insurance for 6 months. The Affordable Care Act says that if you do not purchase insurance, you will get a penalty on your tax form. Either way, it is a penalty. Yet a new wrinkle has been thrown into this debate because last week it was ruled that, in a reconciliation, the Republicans cannot include this penalty provision. Without it, the entire Page S4158 bill falls apart. Markets would collapse. For all of the Republicans talk about the freedom not to purchase insurance, they included a requirement in their bill that people buy insurance. They know they had to because they know that without it, the entire insurance market would collapse. Why is that? If you require insurance companies to charge the same thing for sick people as for non-sick people, then you have to encourage people who are not sick to buy insurance. If you do not, folks will just wait until they are sick to buy insurance, and the only people who will have insurance will be the people who have acute conditions. That will make insurance itself unaffordable, and insurers will stop offering products, or they will jack up rates to the point that it will be totally unaffordable for everyone. In the Affordable Care Act, that is what led to the individual mandate. In the Republican healthcare bill, that is what led to this provision that locks you out of insurance for 6 months. But that has been ruled veritable. That has been ruled essentially out of order under reconciliation. The Republicans are going to be faced with a choice if they are able to get on this bill. They will either remove that provision and guarantee the collapse of the entire insurance market in this country or they will have to strengthen that penalty in order for it to be allowed under reconciliation, but that will essentially rob the last rhetorical argument that the Republicans had in favor of this bill. They cannot argue that it provides more people with insurance. They cannot argue that it helps with cost. They cannot claim that it increases quality. They know that. The only thing left that they could argue is that it allows some people to go without insurance if they do not want it. In truth, their bill does not do that, and the rules of the Senate are going to require that they increase that penalty even more if they want any plausible, workable version of this bill to survive. It leaves us in a place in which there is no argument to do this. It does not advance values that Republicans hold dear, like personal freedom, it does not improve peoples healthcare experiences, and it does not increase the number of people who have healthcare insurance. It really does beg the question Why are we doing this? Did anybody come to the Senate with the desire to hurt this many people? If I had told my Republican colleagues 4 years ago that their ACA replacement plan was going to drive up the number of people without insurance by 32 million and increase rates by 20 percent in year 1, would you have believed it? No. For 6 years, I took my Republican colleagues at their word. I did not agree with them that we should repeal the Affordable Care Act, but at least I thought they had the same goals in mind as we did--more people having access to the healthcare system and costs being controlled for as many people as possible. It is now clear that we do not. The Republicans are about to vote on a bill that will inflict unthinkable amounts of pain on this country. Who gets hurt under the GOP health plan? Everybody. I said this on the floor last week, and I will just say it again to close--that it does not have to be this way. We have accepted for so long that healthcare is a political ping-pong ball that gets tossed from one side to the other every 5 or 10 years. Why is it so inconceivable that Democrats and Republicans could not sit down together and try to work out keeping the parts of the Affordable Care Act that are working and improving the parts that are not? Why couldnt the Democrats understand that the Republicans want flexibility of benefit design and give Republicans something on that if you understood that we want some certainty of these marketplaces? We do not want President Trump to be able to sabotage and undermine these markets. Why cant there be a compromise and a deal there? There is still time. If this vote fails tomorrow, there is still the ability for us to come together, because in the end, there is the story Senator Kaine told about rural Virginia. Everybody here knows that story. Everybody here knows there is enormous work still to be done, and nobody out there is believing the lies about this bill, this wonderful healthcare plan President Trump is promising. Everybody in this country hates this bill. It has a 15-percent approval rate. These folks know there is virtually no one who is helped by this bill other than insurance companies, drug companies, and people who are very affluent and fortunate enough to be healthy. We do not have a communicable disease on our side of the aisle. We are not going to physically hurt you if you get in a room with us. We actually do deeply desire to improve the healthcare system. You have just got to give us a chance. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon. Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise to address the Republican plan to have a vote to proceed to a healthcare bill tomorrow. The only challenge is that we have no idea what bill we are being asked to proceed to. This is hardly the way a democratic republic operates in which the leader of the majority says We want to come to the floor with no committee deliberation, no consultation with healthcare experts, no dialogue with the public, no amendments in committee of any kind, and vote on a mystery bill. The biggest mystery to me is how it is possible that the majority of Republicans are taking seriously a plan to rip healthcare from 20 million-plus Americans in order to give fabulous giveaways to the richest among us. The bill they entertained previously would have given 33 billion to the richest 400 Americans--33 billion. I have mentioned this number before. Some journalists have quoted it as 33 million, and some citizens have said that I meant 33,000. No. It is 33 billion to the richest 400 Americans--enough funds to pay for Medicaid for 700,000 people. What individual would say it is moral to rip healthcare away from 20 million people in order to give tax breaks to the very richest among us? In some misguided, mysterious way, something has gotten ahold of the hearts and minds of my colleagues and made them think this was some kind of good idea to do so much damage to so many. In fact, we have been having this conversation since January. It was earlier this year, when President Trump was sworn in, when the majority said We are going to come to the floor of the Senate, and we are going to repeal healthcare for millions of Americans in short order. Here we are 6 months later, and it has not happened yet--in part because when people look at the details, they start to raise questions. It took a long time for the House to send a bill over to the Senate, and then the Senate proceeded to work on this bill with a group of 13 secret Senators--working in a secret room, in secret meetings--with the public not allowed, with fellow Senators not allowed. They came up with a bill that looked very much like the House bill, and we will talk more about that later. The President said in his campaign and throughout much of this year You are going to have such great healthcare at a tiny fraction of the cost, and it is going to be so easy. Well, it has not been that easy. We have seen the President back a plan from the House and invite everyone over to celebrate at the White House and get the champagne bottles out and say how wonderful it was that the House had passed this healthcare bill--this bill that would strip healthcare from more than 20 million Americans. Then, a couple of weeks later, someone explained to him what was in that bill, and he said Oh, well, that bill is mean and heartless. Then the secret 13 here in the Senate meet, and they come out with a very similar bill. And now Trump is all excited now we have a really good bill, except that in a single year, it would do even more damage to healthcare in America. Along the way, the President moderated his dialogue a bit and said Who knew healthcare could be so complicated? Well, Mr. President, most of the people in America realize we have a complicated healthcare system. We have an overlapping system of six different systems of healthcare. It really is quite messy and difficult. It would be great if we could, in fact, adopt a much simpler system. And I certainly have Page S4159 been advocating for us to have a much simpler system, so just by right of being an American, you are born into this world and you have healthcare. That is the way most developed nations do it, but not here in the United States of America. We have a great healthcare system for the very wealthy, and we have a very complicated, stressful system for everyone else. What are we going to vote on tomorrow? I wish the majority leader would come to the floor and tell us. Will we vote on a motion to proceed to a bill that looks like--what? What can you tell us? Is it TrumpCare 3.0? How does it differ from TrumpCare 1.0 or 2.0? Will it have the Cruz amendment in it for fake insurance, the provision that would do enormous damage on both ends of the insurance market, providing fake insurance policies to the young and the healthy and destabilizing healthcare and putting it into a death spiral for everyone else? Or, Mr. Majority Leader, maybe you could come and tell us if you are planning a straight repeal of the ACA--a straight repeal that would raise costs and premiums even higher and not just rip healthcare from 20-plus million people, but from 30 million-plus people, a plan that would be even more devastating than the previous plan. Is that what you want us to vote to proceed to tomorrow? I can tell you that we shouldnt be voting to proceed to any version on healthcare, something that so affects the peace of mind and the quality of life of Americans. We should be operating like a democracy, like a democratic republic--holding committee hearings, holding a conversation. This is what we did when we talked about the ACA those several years ago. We had more than 100 committee meetings, roundtables, and walk-throughs here in the U.S Senate. We had the single longest markup of a healthcare bill in the HELP Committee ever in the history of the United States. We had the second longest session marking up the bill in the Finance Committee. We had the entertainment of hundreds and hundreds of amendments, and we adopted over 100 Republican amendments. There was a very public, extended process, with a ton of time to go home and consult with healthcare experts and stakeholders in our own States and with the most important stakeholders--the citizens of the United States of America--the men and women and sons and daughters and grandparents. How did they feel about these changes? Well, as everyone knows, President Trump did call the House bill mean and heartless, but we just keep getting bills that are meaner and more heartless. The House bill would kick 23 million people off insurance over the next decade and 14 million just next year. The subsequent bills dont look that different. The secret 13 here in the Senate went and did their deliberations, adopted pretty much the same thing as the Senate, only they made it worse. That June Senate bill would kick 15 million off in a single year, rather than 14 million. And then we had the brilliant idea of a repeal-only bill, which would do even worse, kicking 17 million people off in a single year and 32 million off within the 10-year period. Then we have the bill that isnt even on here because we didnt get a Congressional Budget Office score on it that is, the special Cruz fake insurance amendment bill--the one that would say Hey, insurance companies, you can offer policies that are not worth the paper they are written on. Oh, they are very appealing. There is a health insurance policy. You only have to pay 40 a month. Isnt that great? And then the policyholder who has it, they get in a car accident, they get a broken bone, and they find out the emergency room is not covered, the x rays are not covered, the cast is not covered, the doctor is not covered. Nothing is covered. That is why it is fake insurance. That is why it costs only 40 a month. It might as well be 40 cents a month, for all we care, because it just doesnt cover anything. Then, your spouse--your wife--has the great, joyful news that you are going to have a child together, and guess what. Maternity care is not covered. Can you imagine in this modern era not covering maternity care? Yet, before the Affordable Care Act, many, many policies in America didnt cover maternity care. Well, in addition, these brilliant plans by my colleagues would cause premiums to skyrocket. Then, we have, of course, the fact that they do diabolical things to those who have preexisting conditions. Now, let me spend a little more time on the special Cruz fake insurance version of this. Yes, it gave those very cheap policies that arent worth the paper they are printed on to the young and the healthy. But then, those who are older--those who are sick or have injuries or have preexisting conditions or are concerned that they may develop difficult medical issues--they need to buy a policy that actually covers the things that one would expect, that has an essential benefits package, the same as every single policy in America today has. But, because the young and the healthy are buying the fake policies, that means that the costs skyrocket on the policies with the essential care benefits. As a result of that, more people bail out who feel like they are not directly in danger of getting sicker or injured, and then the cost of the policy goes up even more. It is a death spiral for insurance fake insurance at one end, destruction of the insurance market at the other end. So my colleagues decided to not even share the Congressional Budget Office analysis of that bill. It was that bad. Lets see what some folks said about this. Larry Levitt, senior Vice President of the Kaiser Family Foundation said If there were a Joy of Cooking for insurance, this would be the perfect recipe for destabilizing the market and turning the marketplaces into high-risk pools. That is his comment about the Cruz fake insurance plan. Lets turn to a joint letter from Blue Cross Blue Shield and from Americas Health Insurance Plans about the Cruz insurance plan, the Cruz fake insurance plan. Their letter says It is simply unworkable in any form and would undermine protections for those with pre-existing medical conditions, increase premiums and lead to widespread terminations of coverage for people currently enrolled in the individual market. Or how about an article in the Atlantic by Vann Newkirk, published just a week ago, July 14 of this year The Cruz amendment creates almost a textbook scenario of wide-scale adverse selection--whereby riskier and more expensive patients wind up concentrated in risk pools--and entirely undermines any tools for managing that adverse selection. That is a fancy way of talking about the death spiral in insurance for those who are not young and healthy. Then we go to the conversation that CBO says is the worst option of all 17 million would lose coverage in the first year and 32 million by 2026 under the repeal-only plan. Next year, in just 1 year, premiums would skyrocket above what they might have gone to anyway by an additional 25 percent. Now, our majority leader likes to say that wouldnt actually happen because provisions in the bill dont go into effect for 2 years. Well, these estimates and these commentaries take that into account, because the destabilization in the marketplace begins immediately. Does anyone really think insurance companies are going to stick around the marketplace that they dont know is going to exist in 1 or 2 years? This repeal-and-run strategy would throw our healthcare industry into chaos. If you think it is a good plan, well, I have some beachfront property in Arizona you might want to buy. Every version of this Republican TrumpCare plan is worse and worse for the American people, yet these are the options that are being put forward. The majority leader wants us to vote to proceed to this set of undesirables tomorrow, these undesirable--in fact, undesirable is just too kind of a word for these policies. These are despicable. These are destructive. These are, as the President said, mean and hard- hearted. Shouldnt we try to pursue options that will make our healthcare system work better? That is what we need to do. Lets start by nailing down the cost-sharing reduction payments, or CSRs. These payments are a lifeline to more than 12 million low-income Americans. They lower the premiums, and they lower the deductibles. They are important sources of stability for Page S4160 insurance companies. But our President has said I am not sure I want to release these CSR payments. So what happens with that? Insurance companies have to assume they are not going to get them, so they are raising their rates or perhaps bailing out of the market completely. If these CSR payments are terminated, insurers may leave these exchanges altogether. For those who do stay in, the average premiums for silver plans would need to increase by 19 percent just to compensate for the loss of the CSRs. Because insurance companies are like any other business, they need to know how much they are going to be paid if they provide a product, and right now, they dont know. Lets hear what some have had to say. When the insurance company Anthem pulled out of Ohio in June--last month--the company cited continual changes in Federal operations, rules and guidance as the main reason for exiting the marketplace. The company also said that the individual market remains volatile and the lack of certainty of funding for cost sharing reduction subsidies . . . does not provide a sustainable path forward. Then there is Brad Wilson, the president of Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina, who said The biggest single reason for that rate increase is the lack of the federal funding for Cost Sharing Reduction Payments in 2018. We cannot assume nor should we that the money is going to be there based on what we know today. At another point Mr. Wilson was quoted as saying The failure of the administration and the House to bring certainty and clarity by funding CSRs has caused our company to file a 22.9 percent premium increase, rather than one that is materially lower. . . . The rate increase would be 8.8 percent if the CSRs were guaranteed for 2018. A single-digit increase versus more than a 20-percent increase, and they have to go with the higher increase because they dont know if the President is going to make the payments that he is obliged to make. I think a piece from the Baltimore Sun from May 5 describes the situation we find ourselves in best, when it says Its not the problems in the Affordable Care Act exchanges that are driving the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare. Its the Republican effort to kill Obamacare thats causing problems in the exchanges. President Trump and the Congressional Republicans are trying to exacerbate them. He closes by saying No wonder rates are going up. This really does make clear the situation. The President wants to say the exchanges have problems so we need to repeal and run or repeal and replace. Our answer to the exchanges having problems is to drive 20 million people-plus off healthcare, maybe 30 million people off healthcare. In fact, the exchanges are having problems because they are being sabotaged by President Trump and our Republican colleagues first, by wiping out the reinsurance proposal, which enables companies to go into a new area and compete but only if they have insurance against getting a disproportionate share of the really sick people. That is a very logical part of an insurance plan which encourages companies to go into new markets to compete, and my colleagues sabotaged it. The cost-sharing reduction payments we just talked about, a very key part of lowering premiums and making the policies affordable so struggling, hard-working Americans can buy those policies and have lower premiums and lower deductibles, but my colleagues and President Trump have sabotaged it. That is not a service to the American people. Maybe they feel they are doing a service--to whom? To the rich who can buy insurance without any of this effort to provide insurance throughout our society. Do my colleagues really want a world in which we only have wealth care? That is healthcare that only the wealthy can buy. Do they really want to denigrate, tear down, and destroy the quality of life of millions of their constituents by pursuing this path? It was not that long ago that Franklin Roosevelt said The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much, it is whether we provide enough for those who have little. But in their bills, my colleagues have been saying We want to give massive tax giveaways to those who have the most by ripping healthcare away from those who are struggling, hard-working Americans. It is the opposite. It is the opposite of the belief that we are all in this together, and we want a foundation for every family to thrive. I want a foundation for every family to thrive. That means peace of mind that if your loved one gets sick, they will get the care they need. It is the peace of mind that if your loved one gets sick, they will not end up bankrupt. We are not just talking about ripping healthcare insurance away from more than 20 million people. We are talking about ripping peace of mind away from 20 million people. We are not just talking about those individuals. We are talking about undermining the rural and urban healthcare infrastructure which helps everyone. I have been out in very rural, Republican parts of my State holding townhalls. I am hearing from those who are in clinics, and they have improved considerably. Some of them have doubled their number of employees over the last 8 years because of the support for healthcare clinics in the ACA and also because their uncompensated care--the number of people they were serving who couldnt pay their bills--has dropped enormously. So not only have they been able to employ a lot more people providing healthcare in the community, but they have been able to do additional things. They have been able to provide more preventive services, more mental health services, and so forth. So it has been a big win for rural America, and my colleagues want to tear that down. That just doesnt make any sense at all. That is why everyone here should vote unanimously to oppose going onto a mystery healthcare bill tomorrow. There is so much we could do together if we want to improve healthcare fix those CSRs provide a fix to reinsurance proceed to have a full enrollment period rather than cutting it short retain and reinforce the individual mandates so those who have insurance are covered throughout the spectrum, from the young and healthy to those who are older provide the sort of advertising that enables people to sign up and make the signup process a lot easier than it is right now. There is so much we can do together to make our healthcare system work better. My colleagues have come to the floor tonight to say this really matters. Quit playing games with peoples lives, quit trying to destroy the foundation for our families to thrive, and vote no on a motion to proceed to a mystery healthcare bill tomorrow. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii. Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, the Senate Republicans are about to take one of the most reckless actions in Senate history. They are going to vote to blow up the American healthcare system and do I dont know what next. I want to be really clear about this. Never before has the Senate voted on major legislation that would reorder one-sixth of the American economy and impact tens of millions of American families without even knowing what the bill does. There has been no bipartisanship. There have been no hearings. Let me just say something about hearings. This may seem like sort of a process or procedural complaint, but this very much matters. Hearings matter because it is how you get experts to tell you whether your bill is any good, whether it is smart or stupid, harmful or helpful. Hearings matter because they subject your bill and the process to public scrutiny. The media is able to report on what you are up to, and your constituents know what you are up to. So it is not a small thing to complain about no hearings. In fact, you cant be a good legislator without having hearings, and you cant be an effective legislative body without conducting public hearings. We never have major legislation without hearings, but that is exactly what they are doing, and there is one very simple reason for this. They are embarrassed by what is in this bill. It is true we dont know exactly what is in this bill. There are lots and lots of versions and lots of notions being kicked around, but we can be sure of a few things. Page S4161 First, we know this that whatever problems there are with the Affordable Care Act, this bill doesnt even bother to try to fix them. To the extent that people are worried about high deductibles, it actually increases the deductibles. To the extent that people are worried about the lack of choices on the healthcare exchanges, it doesnt even try to fix that. Second, we dont know exactly how much they are going to cut Medicaid, but they are going to cut Medicaid. Whether it is rolling back the Medicaid expansion or making these radical structural reforms, essentially block-granting Medicaid to the States, they are going to deeply cut Medicaid. This hurts people. It hurts people in nursing homes. It hurts people with drug addiction. Medicaid is a program that works and delivers care for millions of Americans, and it will be slashed massively tomorrow. We also dont know whether they are going to keep the capital gains tax cut or get rid of it. In any case, they are going to get rid of most of the revenue in the Affordable Care Act. They are cutting taxes for the very wealthy, and the way they pay for that is to cut Medicaid. So under the guise of fixing the ACA, they do the thing they wanted to do all along--cut taxes, cut Medicaid. It has nothing to do with ACA cut taxes, cut Medicaid. That is what the bill tomorrow will do. I dont care if it is the 2015 version. I dont care if it is BCRA. I dont care if it is a new Senate version. I dont care if it is Cruzs. All this cuts taxes for the wealthy and cuts Medicaid. That is what this legislation does. Americans are going to be hurt by this legislation people with preexisting conditions, families with a loved one struggling with opioid abuse, people in nursing homes, people who rely on Medicaid, people who rely on Planned Parenthood. The tens of millions of people who will lose their insurance almost instantly. That is why every single patient advocacy group, from the American Cancer Society to the March of Dimes, to the National Physicians Alliance, to disability groups, to the AARP--everybody hates this bill. Make no mistake, they hate every version of it. It is not like there is a less harmful version. Either 22 million or 23 million or 32 million lose their healthcare. We dont have to do this to ourselves. We dont have to do this to the American people. So there are lots of different versions of this legislation. What the leader is doing, very cleverly, is allowing people to believe that the thing they are moving to is the thing they may prefer. In other words, it is a blank canvas. It is just a motion to proceed. It is just a motion to begin debate. Make no mistake, the vote tomorrow is to repeal the Affordable Care Act with no plan to replace it. That is what they are doing tomorrow, and they have been totally secretive because they know the moment they start talking specifics, the whole thing comes crashing down. There are core elements of this vote tomorrow that are true no matter what. It cuts Medicaid it cuts taxes for the rich it reduces patient protections it reduces the number of people who have insurance and it will all be done with no hearings, no Democrats, no experts in healthcare. This thing will be dropped on us without enough time to review it, without enough time to interact with our home State to figure out what the impact would be. We are being asked to do one of the most reckless things any group of legislators has ever been asked to do, which is to jump off a policy cliff--a healthcare cliff, a political cliff--and eventually they are going to tell you it is going to work out. Make no mistake, the reason they cant tell you what is in the bill is the moment they do, this thing will come crashing down. What we have to do is make sure this thing comes crashing down anyway, and we have to do it for the tens of millions of Americans who depend on Medicaid and the ACA. We have to do it for our rural hospitals, we have to do it for people with preexisting conditions, and we have to do it for people without power, without money, without the ability to walk 200 yards from this Chamber to the U.S Senate doctor, the best healthcare in the world. Not only are we on the exchange--I have a Kaiser plan so we are on the exchange, we are in ACA--but also, anytime I want, if I have a headache, if I have a stomach ache, if I have something more serious, I can literally walk about 200 yards from here, go to the Senate doctor, and get whatever kind of healthcare I need. I want you to understand how lucky the people who are voting on your future are and how privileged we all are in this literally gilded place, when peoples lives and livelihoods and life savings are on the line tomorrow, and if I get so much as a hangnail, I get to call my staff and have them help me out. We are lucky people, and we need to think about whom we are representing. I will be fine. Every Member of this Chamber will be fine, but our job is not to take care of ourselves. Our job is to represent our constituents. This bill has earned a really historic title Most unpopular major bill in American history. Most unpopular major bill in American history. How that can get 20 votes, let alone 51, is beyond me. I want to make one last point. We need to kill this bill, not just because of all the harm it is going to do to the country, we need to do it for the legislative branch of the U.S Government. We just cant make laws like this. Right now, the majority party is shortsighted because at some point Democrats are going to have the gavel. The temptation to follow this precedent being set this week, to enact major legislation without hearings and without the other party, might destroy the Senate itself. There is still time. There is still good will. We can walk back from the brink and do the right thing. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr. Sullivan. The Senator from Georgia. Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, it is nice to see you here at 11 p.m on Monday night. One of the privileges we have of being in the majority is that we get to preside over the U.S Senate, so we can listen to all of our colleagues talk to this august body. I have been in that chair for the last couple of hours. I cant go to bed tonight without putting the record straight in this body. I dont think there is a Member of the U.S Senate who doesnt want America to have the best healthcare in the world. The problem is, we have a campaign of disinformation that is underway right now, and it is outrageous. I cannot let it stand. My mission tonight, very briefly, will be to put some facts on the table, on the record, because we have a lot of innuendo right now, a lot disinformation Oh, my God, people are going to die. Let me remind everybody, we are sitting here with a healthcare system that is collapsing. There is no other way to describe it. Why are we here tonight at 11 p.m ? Before I get to healthcare, I want to remind the American public of why the U.S Senate is open tonight. We also did this earlier in the spring because something historic is underway right now in the United States of America and that is this For the first time in our history, the minority party has not waived a Senate rule that would bypass the time requirements when confirming a nominee by the President of the United States. Because of that, we today have confirmed only around 29 percent of this Presidents nominees. The prior President, at this very point in time, had over 70 percent--over 70 percent--almost 300 people. I think the number today is under 50 for this President. It wasnt until a month or so ago that he could even have a full staff meeting. By the way, who is running America today? Holdovers from the last administration because we havent been able to confirm the new nominees. Over 200 people right now stand in line, waiting to be confirmed by this body. It is outrageous. The American people ought to be upset. They ought to be more than upset. Lets define who is doing that. It is not the majority. The minority party is dragging their feet because it slows down everything else. Guess what doesnt get done this year if we continue with this schedule. Unless we are here every night, as we are tonight, we will not have time to get to taxes this year. We will not have time to get to what the American people are assuming we are going to get to. Consumer confidence is at a 13-year high Page S4162 because they are anticipating that we are going to clean up some of this mess. Let me quickly move on to healthcare and put a few facts on the record tonight before we close. There are five healthcare systems in America. We forget this. We talk only about ObamaCare right now, but there are five healthcare systems in America. First, we have group policies. This is where almost the majority--the vast majority are in this. Anyone who works in a company or in a large organization has a group policy. Then there is the individual market. The individual market is what ObamaCare addresses. It is only 13 percent of the entire healthcare system. Then there is the VA. Then there are Medicare and Medicaid. There are five different systems of healthcare in the United States. What we are dealing with is the individual market and Medicaid--mostly the individual market. Let me try to describe the situation as we see it today. In 2008, before the ACA, there were 48 million people in America who did not have insurance. That is a catastrophe by anyones measure. In the richest country in the history of the world, we had 48 million people who did not have insurance. You could be precluded from having insurance because of a preexisting condition. You could lose your insurance. You couldnt transfer across State lines. If you changed companies, even in group policies, you could be denied coverage under the next employers policy. There were real problems. Both sides had responsibility for that, but today after the ACA, 28 million people, as we stand here tonight, still do not have insurance in America--28 million. Of the 20 million who got it, 16 got it only because of the expansion of Medicaid, not because of ObamaCares work in the individual market 16 million got it because of the expansion of Medicaid. All that was, was bribery from the Federal Government to certain States that decided to take the money and run. They didnt do their citizens a full justice. What we see of the remaining 4 million of the 20 million who got insurance during ObamaCare--remember, 16 million got it because of the expansion of Medicaid of the remaining 4 million, 2 million are like my wife and me. Do you remember the day when President Obama said that if you like your insurance, you can keep your insurance and if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor? Like most Democrats in the Senate and the House who voted on ObamaCare without reading it, he obviously didnt know what was in the bill because neither of those things were true. I was canceled. In an individual policy before I ran for the U.S Senate, my individual policy as a retiree was canceled, and the only policy we could get under the exchange in ObamaCare included things like vision, hearing, drug rehabilitation. I have never had a problem with that. My wife hasnt either. By the way, maternity--I met my wife in first grade. We are not having babies at this age. What is that? My rate is almost double because we had to take things in policies that we did not need. Of the remaining 2 million, 1 million are the most destitute, low- income people who really do need our help, but we have disrupted the entire healthcare system because the Democrats thought that the bigger government approach would work. How has that worked out in places like the VA? I hear talk now about single payer I will get to that in a second. If you like the VA, you are going to love a single-payer system because that is exactly what it is. Let me go on. I have heard a lot of talk in this Chamber tonight about, oh my God, the Republicans are going to hurt people in America-- hurt people in America. Let me talk about who is hurting people in America today. This is a travesty in itself. We cannot get the information from the IRS. We have just now gotten the information from the IRS. In 2014, the IRS, under the rules of ObamaCare, fined 8 million people 1.8 billion. Mr. President, I dont know about you, but I am outraged. I know you are too. The irony of that is that 85 percent of the people who were fined in 2014--1.8 billion--85 percent made less than 50,000, and less than half of them made 25,000. What our Democratic friends did was cram down the throats of Americans this thing called ObamaCare, and then they put fines on people who couldnt afford insurance, and they are the poorest people in our country. Who is standing for those guys today--the Democrats? Dont you bet. They want a Big Government solution that gives them more power, and they could not care less about the very poor people they claim to champion. I have had enough of it. This is outrageous. Twenty-two million people are going to lose insurance. That is what they tell us. Lets clean this up right now. The CBOs own estimate says that once you remove the mandate--forget about what else is available. If you just remove the mandate, because the policies are so expensive, 15 million are going to give it up. That is happening today. By the way, do you know that CBO is using a March 2016 baseline to compare these numbers to? It is outrageous. In business, you would never accept this. Yet today they are determined to be the holy grail up here. I havent seen a number come out of the CBO that I would depend on yet. In fact, in 2010, they overestimated the number of people who would sign up for ObamaCare by 12 million people. They missed the estimate by more than 50 percent. This isnt a rounding error. They dont know what they are doing. Right now, today, we have the same problem. Fifteen million people say they will give up their insurance voluntarily because it is too expensive. That has nothing to do with the new plan. That is because ObamaCare is too expensive. They also say that 4 million people will give up Medicaid. Medicaid is free. Why would somebody give up Medicaid? They say ObamaCare is so good and so affordable that they are going to add 5 million people to it. There is no evidence today that would back that claim up. That is not a quantified model outcome. It is the estimate of a person who sits over there and makes this up. The other side is acting like, oh my goodness, this is the holy grail. Lets talk about this. The premiums under ObamaCare prior to this year, over the last 2 years, are up over 105 percent in America. They say that the reason premiums are going up is because of uncertainty coming out of the White House. This years rates were determined last year, before we even knew this President was going to be a nominee. That is more disinformation. What I am fed up with is that it sounds like a good story until you see the facts. The premiums in my State alone going into next year are going up 42 percent. Here is the untold truth In my State, 96 of 159 counties have only one carrier. That is a monopoly. They can do pretty much whatever they want. That is under ObamaCare, not anything else we are talking about. That is the reality today. By the way, here is the real comeuppance. Today in my State--and you have the same problem in your State--300,000 people who make less than the poverty rate in my State cannot get insurance today under ObamaCare. Forget about what we are talking about to fix this mess. Today under ObamaCare, they cant get insurance--300,000 people in my State. That is true in every State in our country. That is the untold ugliness of ObamaCare. ObamaCare is hurting people right now. I am tired of hearing the other side talk about how they care for people--they care for people-- and then they fine the poorest people in America 1.8 billion. Then they deny 300,000 people in my State access to healthcare. Enough already. What are we doing about it? Six months ago, this President said that there were four objectives that any healthcare system in America and the individual market had to meet. The first was access. We have already talked about how ObamaCare is failing people who need access to it. The lowest income people in America are being denied insurance under ObamaCare. We fixed that. People who want insurance are going to get insurance. By the way, premiums were the second thing we had to do to try to get costs down because it is becoming too Page S4163 prohibitive. I have sons in the middle of their careers. They cant really afford the insurance they are being offered today. I feel it firsthand in my own life. Premiums right now, though--if we put into place the suggestions we have on the table right now, the HHS Department has estimated just last week with a very credible model that rates could come down as much as 78 percent in the next 4 years. Has anybody heard the other side remind us of that data point? No. Why do those rates come down? Because the free-market system gets to act again, instead of being shackled in choices being removed. All of a sudden, now we move into it. By the way, they talk about these made-up fantasy policies. Wait a minute. I had one of those made-up fantasy policies that you cant get today under ObamaCare. It is called catastrophic coverage. For some people with a high deductible, catastrophic coverage--that works. They are denied that today because Big Government knows more about what you need in your personal life. The third thing we had to do--and this was very important. The second part of this problem is that Medicaid was not on a sustainable path. I am sorry. They have overpromised, and they cannot deliver. There is no way over the next 30 years that we can sustain Medicaid. Just as Medicare and Social Security are going bankrupt, we cannot afford to do what they are promising people we are going to do. They know that. They already know that. Just like the Great Society, these Big Government programs that they promise all the time are going to work have never worked. The Great Society, the War on Poverty was going to remove poverty from America. I remember that. I sit at a desk where that bill was signed by the then-Democratic leader of the Senate, Richard Russell, before it went to the White House. I am reminded every day of how Big Government has failed the American people. That war on poverty has spent trillions of dollars trying to reduce poverty in America. Yet, today, the poverty rate is fundamentally the same as it was in 1965 when that was signed into law. Big Government does not work in situations like this. I lived under a single payer. My son lived under a single payer. This is the alternative they are after. I have heard it mentioned three times on the floor of the Senate tonight. We cannot go there. It bifurcates delivery. It would add 3.2 trillion. That is more than we spend on all of our mandatory expenses today--3.2 trillion every single year. That is impossible. If you think that would work, imagine this. Go home and look at your tax bill. Whatever you paid the Federal Government last year, double it. That is what that would mean. It is not workable. The fourth thing we had to do was make sure preexisting conditions were protected. I worried about that through my entire career. If I changed jobs, if I had been sick or my family had been sick, I might have been denied insurance. We cant allow that. This bill doesnt allow that. We protected preexisting conditions. We put Medicaid on a sustainable path for the long term. We also bring premiums down. That was a major priority here. And we give everybody in America access to healthcare--period, end of the conversation. That is not good enough. The other side is not going to be happy until this Federal Government steps in and takes over 18 percent of our economy called healthcare. They tried to do it in 1992 to 1994, under HillaryCare. They tried to do it here. I remember the Speaker of the House saying If you want to know what is in this bill, you have to vote for the bill. We are not doing that today. This cloud of innuendo that the other side has perpetrated on the American people is just not true. In 2010, not one Republican voted for ObamaCare. Not one amendment got to the floor of this Senate. Yet they want to talk about this great open policy. They had 7 years to fix this mess. People in my State have been hurt by it. It is unforgivable, and we can do something about it this week. Senator John McCain is very sick. He is a fighter. He will take care of this. I hope he will be back this week to help us. If he can, I think he will. We are going to vote on it this week. We have to do this for the American people. I want to remind everybody what is at stake here. If we dont pass this tomorrow, then we end up moving toward a single-payer system. Let me remind everybody of the other Big Government failures we talk about the VA and the Postal Service. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are bankrupt. We talk about the ObamaCare failures. Then there is the Great Society of rural poverty. I want to remind everybody. Let me close with this. I heard tonight that this is a reckless action, the new policy. I heard New Testament examples about how to take care of your brethren. It is shocking to me that somebody on the other side would say that when they know these statistics of what they have done--8 million of the poorest people in America have been fined 1.8 billion. Half of them make under 25,000 a year. That is taking care of your brethren all right. I am embarrassed. We can fix that. I believe we heard the rain of devastation No one is helped by this bill it is a reckless act. Here is the one I love We want to work with you. We want to work with you to help fix this thing. Just a year ago, I didnt hear any speeches in here--I dont think you did from that Chair--where anybody on that side acknowledged that there was anything wrong with ObamaCare. You hear today We want to work with you to help fix ObamaCare. It is 7 years too late, in my opinion. It would have been nice to have been included in the conversation in 2009 and 2010 when it was crammed down the throats of Republicans. I believe this is a historic moment in America, not just for healthcare. Healthcare is very important, but it is bigger than that. This is about the direction of our country. Are we going to try to trust Big Government again and again until we cant afford it? We are already well down that rabbit hole. We cannot afford this chance again. We have already proven it doesnt work. I hope that this week colleagues on our side will get together and we will vote this thing in. I welcome any Democratic support as well. I know we are not going to get it. This is a time to stand. I hope we will have that vote. I fully encourage my colleagues here to support that. Lets get on with business.",homeless
baltimore,The Evolving Politics of Punk in the Nation's Capital,2015-07-16T00:00:00Z,The American Prospect Blogs,Baltimore City Paper,"Before the doors opened, attendees gathered in a hot and crowded hallway, next to tables displaying books curated to the nights guests an oral history of punk, a Bob Dylan biography, a chronology of the riot-grrrl movement. When the doors finally opened, parents with children on their shoulders and teenagers with dyed-blue hair and safety-pinned jackets filed past librarians who stamped their hands with WITHDRAWN.ltnlgt Librarian joke, one of them said with a smirk.ltnlgt Less than a week before, Priests had played to sold-out crowd at one of the District of Columbias top music venues, the 930 Club, where the price of admission was 25. But the show in the library basement was free and for all ages. It was a celebration of the librarys newly created Punk Archive, a project meant to document, save, and catalog the citys punk and hardcore history and culture.ltnlgt Opening for Priests were two other local bands, Blockhead and Nox. Many of the performers, like the three high-school girls comprising Nox, werent old enough to have seen the bands celebrated by the Punk Archivebands like Bad Brains, Fugazi, Nation of Ulysses, and Minor Threat that thrived during the Districts punk heyday, which began in the late 1970s and continued into to early 90s.ltnlgtltnlgtltnlgt The flyer for the MLK Library basement show in December 2014ltnlgtltnlgtltnlgtLocated about a half-mile from the White House, the MLK Library is a modernist, glass-and-steel structure that looms large among the downtown office buildings housing lobbyists and special-interest groups.ltnlgt If it seems surprising that such a strait-laced city has long been a hotbed of a stripped-down, confrontational genre of music, consider the logic of it Where better to nurture a political, anti-authority art form than the home of that authority?ltnlgt That a public library is the latest institution to commemorate a genre centered on fighting the establishment might also be counterintuitive, but the sense of D.C.s past punk glory is strong and for many it is an inextricable part of local culture. Recent years have seen a number of documentary films and projects memorializing the Districts punk scene. But the rash of recent reminiscence has prompted some to meditate on the timing Perhaps its pure coincidence, or perhaps a couple of decades is just the typical time lapse before nostalgia sets in.ltnlgt Or perhaps, for a city that has undergone massive changes in the past decadehyperspeed development, skyrocketing cost of living, neighborhood gentrification, and demographic shiftsthe reason for the current retrospective is not simply to document the music its to document the way the city used to be. The hope for those active in D.C.s music scene is that despite all the change and all the looking back, art here can still take on its own meaning and propel change.ltnlgt ltnlgt ltnlgtltnlgt Photo Mike Maguireltnlgtltnlgt Priests performed a free show in the basement of D.C.s central public library. Less than a week earlier, they had opened for the Dismemberment Plan at the citys famous 930 Club. In this photo is bassist Taylor Mulitz left and singer Katie Alice Greer. Other members of the band include drummer Daniele Daniele and guitarist G.L. Jaguar.ltnlgtltnlgtltnlgtMLKS PUNK ARCHIVE1 ISNT the first such collection of local music. George Washington University houses a vernacular music archive2 that includes punk items, and also features folk music and go-goD.C.s homegrown fusion of funk, jazz, R...and hip-hop. Academic institutions across the country preserve local art and music, and Michele Casto, special collections librarian and curator of the Punk Archive, cites the University of Louisvilles Underground Music Archive3 as another example. It is a testament, though, to the tremendous impact Washington, D.C.s scene has had on the genre that the Punk Archive was recently awarded a four-minute segment on the BBC4, which included footage from the first basement show in October, featuring the feminist punk band Hemlines.ltnlgt Im constantly, constantly amazed at how much great local music is being produced here, she said. We dont just mean Minor Threat or Fugaziits much more expansive. Casto hopes that eventually the archive will feature other aspects of the Districts music culture, specifically go-go and jazz.ltnlgt Elizabeth Sauvage of the band Coup Savage and the Snips5, which played the library basement in April, is all for that. Just because D.C. punk was the dominant white-kid form of expression at the time, it doesnt mean there was a space for me or others like me, said Sauvage. However, for better or worse, we are an extension of that punk and hardcore scene, having grown up steeped in it and the DIY ethos of this town. But in no way is that all we are. Plus theres a whole other rich vein of D.C. music that gets ignored.ltnlgt The Punk Archives intention of including other aspects of the Districts musical heritage, from go-go to Black Broadway as the U Street Corridor was known is widely supported. D.C. is not known as a cultural capital, Mark Andersen, historian of the punk scene and community activist, told me. Part of the blindness to D.C.s cultural richness is racism. The importance of that history should not be underestimated.ltnlgt In the third-floor special collections section of the MLK library, Casto showed me the corner where all the punk artifacts are being stored. I asked to see the collection of riot-grrrl zines6, and she pulled down a box filled with neat stacks of the black-and-white books from the early 1990s, made on photocopiers. I carefully thumbed through the pages of defiantly feminist poetry, essays, and art. Casto moved to a table where posters were layered between clear plastic. Many of them were for shows featuring the band the Slickee Boys, who were active during the 1970s and 80s.ltnlgt A shorter-term goal of Castos is to create and online portal with PDFs of the punk posters and zines, streaming music, and links to other archives. Guests to the collection will also be able to listen to donated cassettes and vinyl LPs. Its telling a story with context, she explained. The archival material will bring the descriptive content to life.ltnlgt In addition to all the fans who contributed their mementos to the archive, Casto has a roster of dozens of volunteers anxious to donate their time to building websites or cataloging content.ltnlgt A wealth of archival material came when Casto got in touch with filmmaker James Schneider, a connection that helped catalyze the archive project she said library staff had been discussing for months. During the course of creating the forthcoming documentary Punk the Capital Straight from Washington, D.C.7, Schneider and co-filmmaker Paul Bishow compiled a wealth of historical material, ranging from rare photographs and posters to more than a mile of Super-8 footage.ltnlgtltnlgt Photo Mike Maguireltnlgtltnlgt Ian Svenonius and his band Chain and the Gang perform at the MLK Memorial Library in January. Svenoniuss music career has included multiple Washington, D.C.-based bands, including the Make-Up and Nation of Ulysses.ltnlgtltnlgtltnlgtThe workspace for the Punk the Capital documentary is in a century-old building the Adams Morgan neighborhood. Casto lives in the same building, and had helped the filmmakers secure their space. Just a couple blocks away is the building that was once the fabled Madams Organ house not to be confused with Madams Organ, a nearby bar. By varying descriptions, Madams Organ was in the late 1970s an art space, a collective, a music venue, and a punk squatters paradise.ltnlgt The heart of Schneider and Bishows film is rare footage of early Madams Organ shows, filmed long before the neighborhood of Adams Morgan was transformed into the nightlife mecca it is now. Its a really symbolic place where the old passes into the new, Schneider said.ltnlgt Sitting in front of the large computer monitor in his studio, Schneider scrolled past grainy Super-8 footage of an early Bad Brains show and hit play on an interview with Brian Baker of Minor Threat. This is the soundtrack to my teenage years, basically, Schneider said.ltnlgt Doing things here takes on a new meaning, of fighting the power, Schneider said of the punk scene in the nations capital. It created a charged atmosphere, where you had to take a stand for who you were and what you believed. It has meaning beyond the music.ltnlgt Now nearing completion, according to Schneider, Punk the Capital will be the latest in a spate of films devoted to the Districts scene and its history. Theres Salad Days A Decade of Punk in Washington, D.C. 1980-908, and Positive Force More Than a Witness9, about the punk activist organization of the same name. Then theres last years D.C. episode10 of Dave Grohls HBO series, Sonic Highways, and the upcoming documentary about H.R. of Bad Brains, called Finding Joseph I11.ltnlgt I hope it is more than nostalgia, because nostalgia is kind of a totally anti-punk thing, Mark Anderson said in an October appearance12 on WAMUs The Kojo Nnamdi Show. Punk is about now.ltnlgtltnlgtltnlgt Coup Sauvage and the Snips perform in the basement of Washington, D.C.s central library in April. The ongoing series of shows in in support of the librarys Punk Archive.ltnlgtltnlgtltnlgtAndersen is the author of and contributor to several books, including Dance of Days Two Decades of Punk in the Nations Capital. A co-founder of Positive Force D.C., which has been organizing benefit shows and raising money in the District for more than three decades, he has been active in the citys punk community since he moved here in 1984. Today he co-directs We Are Family, a senior outreach program, embracing what he calls a punk approach to community activism.ltnlgt The D.C. punk scene was always about growth and community, he told me earlier this year. That sense of collectivity is what artists like Schneider are trying to capture, and its almost palpable even for artists as young as Anna Wilson, one of the members of Nox, who played the basement show in December with Priests.ltnlgt Wilson, 15, is a member of the vinyl club at D.C.s Alice Deal Middle School, which was formed when she was a student there. She has been taking guitar lessons for years from musician Mary Timony of Helium, Wild Flag, and, now, Ex Hex13, who helped connect her six years ago with the two other members of Nox, Claire and Stella. She now attends Wilson High School in Northwest D.C.the same high school that Ian MacKaye attended. MacKaye, of Minor Threat, Fugazi, and co-founder of Dischord Records14, is arguably the most revered figurehead of local punk.ltnlgt For Anna Wilson, punk is still important because the issues the members of Fugazi wrote aboutwar, commercialism and capitalism, racism and sexismhavent gone away. Punk influences how I thinkyou learn from it, she said. I think that what a lot of punk songs have in common is that theyre saying something.ltnlgt Growing up here, Wilson explained, my parents were always playing Fugazi and go-go bands. You definitely get a reminder and a sense of what it was like.ltnlgt But what it was like 30 years ago is very different than it is now. As rent goes up and as noisy rehearsals and performances become less acceptable in gentrified neighborhoods, the documentaries and archive projects are a reminder of what it used to be like in the city that nurtured bands like Fugazi and gave rise to independent record labels like Dischord. But that doesnt mean that punks fusillade of social commentary has ended it just looks and sounds a bit different than it has in the past, as the genre widens to embrace more groups and new messages. And when it comes to showing how the city has changed, punks singers are yelling about it.ltnlgt ltnlgtltnlgt Photo Mike Maguireltnlgtltnlgt Chain and the Gang perform in the front hall of the Martin Luther King Jr. Public Library in Washington, D.C., in January. The show was part of the Fringe Music in the Library series.ltnlgtltnlgtltnlgtWHILE THE CITY SEEMS to have a hard time letting go of the past, the lines defining what is punk, never well-defined, have become blurrier. Though most articles on Priests15 insist on describing the band as punk, Katie Alice Greer, the bands singer, remains skeptical of the word, saying its more important for the band to have a clear vision of what its members value, and to make art about that. Perhaps thats because even bands as popular as Priests have a hard time avoiding reviews16 that mention17 Ian MacKaye or Fugazi18, no matter how different their sound.ltnlgt I do think its important to write your own history, Greer told me. But the only reason to spend time looking backward is to understand where youre going, to look forward. I just dont want to be interviewed a million times about Fugazi and other bands when Im pouring myself into my own music right now.ltnlgt D.C. is really good at mythologizing its punk and hardcore past, said Kristina Sauvage of Coup Sauvage and the Snips. The members of the Haus of Sauvage decline to use their government names. But lets not forget that as radical as it purports to be, it was hardly as inclusive as it could have been. There have always been peopleespecially women, queer people, and folks of colorwho have felt alienated and been pushed to the margins in punk. Its hard for me as a black woman who grew up in the D.C. area to be too focused on a past that didnt always make room for me.ltnlgt Three decades later, even as the fight for inclusion continues, a new intersectionality is emerging in the local punk movement, a remedy for the slew of retrospective projects that feature a sea of predominately white and male faces.ltnlgt Coup Sauvages music combines disco, hip-hop, house, electronic, and dance with a message that challenges power structures and calls for progressive action and awareness. They defy an easy genre label, though they accept the term dance-punk.ltnlgt Weve also been called neo-soul, said Kristina Sauvage, the lead singer. Because apparently when there are three black women singing, that automatically equals soul.ltnlgtltnlgt Photo Mike Maguireltnlgtltnlgt Kristina Sauvage of Coup Sauvage and the Snips performs at the library basement show in April, in support of the librarys Punk Archive. D.C. is really good at mythologizing its punk and hardcore past, she says. But lets not forget that as radical as it purports to be, it was hardly as inclusive as it could have been.ltnlgtltnlgtltnlgtTheir April performance in the MLK Library basement was joyous and glamorousthe completely sober 730 p.m. crowd was all smiles and danceand at the same time profoundly moving. Especially moving was the song Requiem for a Mountaintop, in which Kristina calls out the names of victims of police violence. We dance for every black and queer and trans body thats been told our lives dont matter, because we know they do, she exclaimed before Crystal and Rain Sauvage joined in with the lyrics Hands up, dont shoot, no more strange fruit.ltnlgt Above all, though, the performance was provoking and motivating. Their song Dont Touch My Hair elicited cheers, and Heir to Nothing, about gentrification that displaces longtime residents and erases the citys cultural history, produced claps and knowing nods in the audience. They might not have sounded like what some would expect punk to sound like, but the gloomy basement was infused with a sense of radical possibility and, importantly, inclusion.ltnlgt Now less a distinctive sound or look than it is a way of creating art, perhaps punks truest indicator is its DIY ethosthe idea that art need not have a steep entrance fee, and that anyone with a guitar can be a creator without help from the commercial industry or even music lessons.ltnlgt With punks lo-fi values, the absence of the kinds of barriers posed by requirements of virtuosity or fancy equipment provides a path to those who would crash its gates.ltnlgt For the decade and a half she has lived in the District, Julie Yoder, the drummer of Hemlines19 whose newsletters to fans often include links to social justice stories20, has been active in promoting womens inclusion in local music. She is a founding member of Girls Rock! DC, a weeklong summer camp where volunteers teach girls to play instruments and form bands, with the mission of instilling confidence and creating supportive and creative spaces. She was also one of the planners of the legendary LadyFest music festival in the early 2000s.ltnlgt The accessibilityin terms of going from not knowing how to play an instrument to knowing how to play it enough to compose a song with other people in a short period of timeis a big part of what punk means to me, said Yoder. You dont have to wait around to consume art you can do it yourself.ltnlgt It helps, too, that D.C.s punk scene is particularly encouraging and welcoming to new artists. I feel like people are so supportive, just by showing up and saying that you want to be part of everything, said Dana Liebelson, the bassist for Hemlines. Its been kind of overwhelming.ltnlgtltnlgt Photo Mike Maguireltnlgtltnlgt Coup Sauvage and the Snips perform the song Dont Touch My Hair in the basement of the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library in April. The lyrics include the lines I see you there, I know youre eyeing meStaring like Im some great mystery.ltnlgtltnlgtltnlgtIt is a lot of pressure, added guitarist and singer Katie Park, because instant acceptance can also mean instant placement in a legacy.ltnlgt A case in point Hemlines had only been a band for less than a year when they were asked to perform at the first basement show in October. Halfway through the show, Ian Villedas guitar broke in half. Before he could stop the music, he said, Amanda MacKayeof the Routineers and other bands, organizer of the beloved Fort Reno free summer concert series21, and sister of the storied Ian MacKayewas up front, holding his guitar together, instructing him to keep playing.ltnlgt ltnlgt WHEN YOU ARE MAKING HISTORY, you dont know it, Mark Andersen told me. Youre just doing whatever youre doing. Hopefully, youre doing something passionate, creative, and making the world a more just and caring place. For Andersen, that means continuing to use art to effect change and not being tempted to focus only on the past.ltnlgt We use the past as a source of fuel, Andersen said, as a way to energize us for what we can do now. What moment are we missing now? What is possible now? Its not the moment that it was in 1984 its a very different Washington, D.C.ltnlgt A primary concern in that very different D.C. is the economic transformation of the city brought by the influx of government contractors and dark political money. And of course, all the condos.ltnlgt At a lunchtime concert on a Friday in January, under the bright fluorescent lights of the front hall of the MLK Library, Ian Svenonius, frontman of the band Chain and the Gang22, climbed onto chairs and stepped over audience members, trailing a long microphone cord behind him.ltnlgt The citys changing, new buildings, Svenonius began monologuing, tossing his mop of black hair out of his eyes. We werent consulted about the state the city would be in! He wore a sleek silver-gray suit in his trademark mod style, and behind him on the stage, in front of the glass doors that said  POPULAR LIBRARY, were his bandmates, a male drummer and two women on bass and guitar in stylish matching silver suits.ltnlgtltnlgt Photo Mike Maguireltnlgtltnlgt Ian Svenonius of the band Chain and the Gang performs in the MLK Memorial Library in downtown Washington, D.C., in January. Their song Devitalize the City addresses the rapid gentrification that has moved through the city, an increasingly common theme in D.C.s punk music.ltnlgtltnlgtltnlgtYou do construction? Svenonius, formerly of the bands Nation of Ulysses and the Make-Up, continued as library patrons holding books looked on in curiosity. Man, I do destruction!ltnlgt Delivering that introduction to the song Devitalize the City, he kicked the air, sometimes collapsed to the ground, and sang about tearing down real estate, cool bars, and all the trappings of economic revitalization.ltnlgt As Kriston Capps of CityLab wrote, gentrification has replaced Ronald Reagan23 as the new villain in punk music. Theres concern about resident displacement, income and racial inequality, and unaffordable housing. And in terms of cultural creativity, theres the fact that its often just too expensive to be an artist and live in the city, a subject Priests singer Katie Alice Greer spoke to in a recent an interview with the Baltimore City Paper24.ltnlgt In the audience at the lunchtime show was Ian MacKaye, who said hello to a group of students from D.C. Public Schools, including Anna Wilson, who was there with the vinyl clubs adviser, Lacey Maddrey, a social worker at Alice Deal Middle School. The students had a half-day at school, a lucky break that allowed Wilson to see one of her favorite bands. Maddrey has organized field trips to record stores and the first two library basement shows. She said that many of the students are deeply connected to the citys punk history simply because their parents were the ones who made the music. We went to the archive, and they were like, Oh look, theres my dad on this record, she said. Maddrey calls the students punk progeny.ltnlgt With a new punk retrospective project, talk, or event announced seemingly every week, its to the librarys credit that they seem to be combating nostalgia fatigue by making an effort to tell young musicians, in the words of librarian Michele Casto, Your music matters just as much as Fugazis. Through their basement show series, they are staking a place in the citys ongoing musical history by insisting that every show features one D.C.-based high school band, such as Nox.ltnlgt The cool thing about the Punk Archive, Maddrey said, is that they can go and see the history, but then see history being made at the same time. Theyre continuing to grow in their own musical way.ltnlgt Schneider, too, hopes his film will help the punk scene grow and continue to engage with important issues. Hopefully, it will serve as a trampoline for moving forward, he said. Maybe, once fans get the nostalgia out of their system, they can continue to fight the system.ltnlgt ltnlgtltnlgt Photo Mike Maguireltnlgtltnlgt Katie Alice Greer of Priests performs in the basement of Washington, D.C.s central public library. The night of the performance, December 4, Black Lives Matter protests were weaving through the nations capital following the announcement that the NYPD officer who had held Eric Garner in a fatal chokehold would not be indicted. Between songs, Greer encouraged the audience to pay attention and engage in protest themselves.ltnlgtltnlgtltnlgtWHILE GREER MAY BE RIGHT to be wary of the term, if being punk is simply a matter of embracing an ideology that is critical of power dynamics and cares for the community, then Priests fits the description. And those attending the library basement show in December were treated to a decidedly punk show.ltnlgt There were the small indications that the show had a leftish bentAnna Wilson was wearing a T-shirt featuring a screen-printed photo of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg with the words NOTORIOUS R.B.G. And then there are Priests lyrics25, which are unapologetically anti-consumerist as well as anti-authority Barack Obama killed something in me, and Im gonna get him for it!ltnlgt But the news had made this nightDecember 4, 2014a charged night, both in the library basement and elsewhere in the nations capital. The day before, a grand jury had decided not to indict the NYPD officer who had held Eric Garner in a fatal chokehold, and a large protest26 was working its way to the Washington Monument from the Justice Departments headquarters. The marchers, just blocks away from the library, could be heard outside. When Priests appeared the night before on a New York television show with legendary riot-grrrl band Sleater-Kinney, Greer wore a Black Lives Matter T-shirt for the performance27.ltnlgt At the library, Greer still didnt shy away from the political, encouraging the audience to engage in meaningful protest and pay attention to what was happening outside. Air Force One is a personal pla-ane! she cried while standing tall on one of the monitors, towering over the audience. The sound system at the 930 Club the week before had been, of course, perfectly good, but there was something far more appropriate and satisfying about the sound crashing into and ricocheting imperfectly off the rectangular walls of the dark basement. The atmosphere was different, tooit wasnt just a performance it was a political experience.ltnlgt A librarian wrapped up the show by stepping onto the stage. At the microphone, she thanked everyone for coming, and reminded them to check the website DC library dot org slash punk!ltnlgt  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27",affordable housing

baltimore,The cities that are already defunding the police,2020-06-27T00:00:00Z,Axios,WBAL,"Whats happening In Minneapolis, the Park and Recreation Board, the University of Minnesota, the public school system, and museums and venues have ended or limited their relationship with the police department, the Star Tribune reported. 3 Last week, the Baltimore City Council approved a 22.4 million budget cut 4for the police department. The Portland City Council cut 15 million5 from its police budget earlier this month. 5 million of that would be put toward a new program that sends unarmed first responders to answer homelessness calls.Philadelphia cancelled a planned 19 million increase for the police department and shifted 14 million of the police budget elsewhere  including affordable housing. The city council in Hartford, Connecticut voted to cut or reallocate6 2 million of its police budget.In Seattle, every department budget is being trimmed by around 10, Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan told Axios Dan Primack on the ReCap podcast. We have to reallocate parts of the budget to take things out of the police department that shouldnt be there ... We have to rethink what remains in the police department, Durkan said. Other cities where officials are calling for changes, according to Local Progress, include San Francisco, San Diego, Los Angeles, Oakland, Milwaukee, Denver, Durham, Winston-Salem, Chicago, New York City and D.C. What theyre saying What is really inspiring is really seeing this movement in city after city after city really working to define for those places what public safety looks like, and what our budget should look like, Local Progress director Sarah Johnson told Axios. Its kind of a reflection of our values as a society. Yes, but The defund the police movement is also strongly polarizing 53 of Americans have an unfavorable view of the movement, compared to just 34 who view it favorably, according to an Axios-SurveyMonkey poll7. The split becomes narrower when the words defund the police arent used.What to watch While the mood is ripe for change in Eugene, Ore., our city government is not designed for immediate reaction, said city council member Greg Evans. Similarly, Dallas City Councilman Casey Thomas told Axios that advocates may not get the full reallocation from police this year, due to the short time frame for the budget process.Nevertheless, he said, In the event that you dont get what you want, stay engaged and stay involved.The U.S. Conference of Mayors on Thursday released principles8 to guide a police reform framework that mayor and police chiefs can adopt to deter patterns of racial discrimination. That framework is expected to be announced in the next month. Between the lines Ongoing protests have put pressure on local decision makers to review police programs and policies just as many cities prepare to start the fiscal year on July 1. Many cities also have been in the process of revising their current fiscal year budgets because of financial shortfalls due to COVID-19, experts say. This will force budget cuts across a broad range of city services  including public safety. While the protests could force more budget cuts to come from police budgets, moving those funds to social programs could be difficult. There wont be money for that, said Michael Belsky, Executive Director of the Center for Municipal Finance at the University of Chicagos Harris School of Public Policy.  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8","homelessness, affordable housing"

The professor was discussing a PowerPoint slide that referenced Potiphars Wife, a Biblical story in which a married woman makes an offer to have sex with one of her husbands slaves, Joseph, only to have him turn her down. To punish him, Potiphars wife then accuses Joseph of rape This is an issue in our society, the professor allegedly said. Now that you all know what this phrase means, you can go use it to describe the Kavanaugh trial, he is recounted as saying.46 Connecting Dots Creates Shocking Truth47 In 2009 James Comey left the Justice Department to go and cash-in at Lockheed Martin. Hillary Clinton was running the State Department, on her own personal email server. The Uranium One issue comes to the attention of Hillary. Like all good public servants do in looking out for Americas best interest, she decides to support the decision and approve the sale of 20 of U.S. Uranium to, no other, than the Russians! Notice that it was not a Donald Trump collusion with the Russiansit was Hillary. This appeared to be a straight up deal, but was it? The people got absolutely nothing out of if. However, prior to the sales approval, no other than Bill Clinton rushed to Moscow, got paid Five Hundred Thousand bucks for a one hour speech, then met with Vladimir Putin at his home for several hours. Again, this was a Clinton, not a Trump. Meanwhile, the FBI had a mole inside the money laundering and bribery scheme. And the FBI director during this time? Yep, Robert Mueller who even delivered a Uranium Sample to Moscow in 2009. And who handled that case within the Justice Department out of the U.S. Attorneys Office in Maryland? Better sit downRod Rosenstein. As for the informant, The Department of Justice placed a GAG order on him and threatened to put him behind bars if he spoke out about it. Sudden Thawt Dept. How did 20 of the most strategic asset of the United States of America end up in Russian hands when the FBI has an informant, a mole, providing inside information to the FBI on the criminal enterprise? After the sale was approved, 145 Million dollars in donations made their way into the Clinton Foundation from entities directly connected to the Uranium One deal. Lois Lerner was still at the Internal Revenue Service working with the Charitable Division where she regularly blocked legitimate churches and ministers from receiving a tax exemption. WHOOSH!

But if we examine the present pantheon of progressive icons, and strip away their reliance on liberal-media protection and transfer them instead into the present age of tabloid promiscuity and cyber omnipresence, would we now have a very different view of their presidencies? The progressive Woodrow Wilson administration likely would never have completed its two elected terms had it operated on media protocols common just a half-century later. For nearly a year during the failing health and death of First Lady Ellen Axson Wilson, the president fell into a state of debilitating depression, carefully hidden from the press. Much later, during the last 17 months of Wilsons presidency, he was more or less unable to fulfill his duties due to a series of strokes that left him partially paralyzed and visually impaired. Those realities were carefully hidden from the public by the efforts of his second wife, Edith Bolling Wilson, and physician Dr. Cary Grayson. In the present case, we know that Trump is neither comatose nor is Melania running the country. The country never learned the full extent of Franklin Delano Roosevelts paralysis. Much less did it know of FDRs past and ongoing affairs  the mechanics of which were sometimes carried out in the White House and with the skillful aid of his own daughter Anna. By fall 1944, Roosevelt, seeking a fourth term, was suffering from a series of life-threatening conditions. Worrying that the public would not vote yet again for a terminally ill president, sympathetic journalists and military physicians covered up Roosevelts illnesses  on the theory that FDR would survive long enough to get elected to a fourth term and ensure a continued Democratic administration.  John F. Kennedy, by contemporary standards, was a serial sexual harasser, if not a likely assaulter. While physically in the White House he carried on sexual trysts with subordinates and others without security clearances, mostly with the full knowledge of the complacent White House press corps. One former JFK intern, Mimi Alford, later wrote a memoir describing losing her virginity at 19 years of age to the president in the White House presidential bed. Lyndon Johnson was not just a serial adulterer and often corrupt, but displayed a level of crudity that would now be seen as clinical, from conducting business while defecating on the toilet to exposing his genitals to staff  apparently as some sort of Freudian proof of his own, and by extension, his nations, manhood.  There is no reason to review the escapades of an impeached Bill Clinton. Despite the efforts of a sympathetic media, many of his transgressions were in part aired to the public. They ran the full gamut of a classical sexist and misogynist, from likely sexually assaulting chance acquaintances to attempting to defame and ruin the reputations of women deemed liable to disclose past liaisons. What differentiates Trumps womanizing from that of prior presidents, like Clintons, is that his escapades were prior to, not during, his presidential service. A study published by the liberal Harvard Kennedy Schools Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy found that coverage of the Trump presidency in its first hundred days was 80 percent negative, as evidenced in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, in addition to CNN, CBS, Fox News and CNBC parent NBC, as well as European news outlets the Financial Times, BBC and ARD in Germany. The same researchers found that coverage of Trump was about twice as negative as had been true of reporting on Barack Obama. NOTA BENE Obamas escapades have yet to be shared, but they will surface eventually52 Destroying America From Within, Part 353 by Roger Anghis Once muslims have established a mosque and created an enclave they begin to grow the population. They use population to take a country over. A popular must have 2.5 children per married couple. Most places are producing less than that but the muslim populations in the UK, Germany, Sweden and even America are producing 5-7 children per married couple. They will actually out populate the local people. Their population growth is where they do their dirty work on the nations they immigrate to. When the Muslim population remains at or under 2, their presence tends to fly low under the radar. In the 2  5 range, Muslims begin to seek converts, targeting those they see as disaffected, such as criminals. When the population reaches 5 they exert influence disproportionate to their numbers, becoming more aggressive and pushing for Sharia law. When the population hits the 10 mark Muslims become increasingly lawless and violent. Once the population reaches 20, there is an increase in rioting, murder, jihad militias, and destruction of non-Muslim places of worship. At 40, there are widespread massacres, chronic terror attacks, and ongoing militia warfare. Once beyond 50, infidels and apostates are persecuted, genocide occurs, and Sharia law is implemented. After 80, intimidation is a daily part of life along with violent jihad and some state-run genocide as the nation purges all infidels. Once the nation has rid itself of all non-Muslims, the presumption is that Dar-es-Salaam has been attained  the Islamic House of Peace.1 What does it look like in America? Not good for our kids and grandkids. Even when Muslims are a minority population they can and do transform whole cultures and societies. And not for the better.

FOX 5 DC- The husband and stepdaughter of a woman who was allegedly stabbed to death by a panhandler in Baltimore last December have been arrested for murder in connection with her death Baltimore City Police announced Sunday, according to WBAL-TV. Keith Smith and his daughter, 28-year-old Valeria Smith, were arrested in Harlingen, Texas, near the U.S.Mexico border, for the murder of Jacquelyn Smith, Acting Baltimore Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said at a news conference. They were reportedly preparing to leave the country. WBAL-TV reports on Dec. 1, 2018, Jacquelyn Smith was riding in a car on Valley Street when she saw a woman holding a sign that read please help me feed my baby. The woman was also reportedly carrying what appeared to be a baby in her arms. Reports say when Jacquelyn Smith gave the woman money, a man reached into the car, grabbed Jacquelyns wallet, stabbed her and ran away. Jacquelyn Smith later died in a local hospital. The crime attracted national attention and prompted many people to regard panhandlers warily. Harrison said that the concocted story took advantage of negative perceptions of Baltimore crime58 Selling Socialism to America59 Socialism is a tough sell to Americans who evaluate ideas based on facts and a remarkably easy sell to Americans who evaluate ideas based on feelings. The adult world of facts is a foreign land to the infantilized world of feelings where low-info millennial voters currently dwell Low-info low-level political leaders like Alexandria Ocasio-Ortez AOC have emerged to help sell Socialism to America. Who is buying? AOCs supporters are low-info millennial voters who have been indoctrinated toward collectivism by the leftist liberal narrative that dominates public education K-12 and dictates university curricula. The leftist takeover of college campuses and its rejection of objective reality is discussed in chilling detail by Andrew Cunningham in his 3.8.19 American Thinker article.

The city has paid out 34 million to 56 families since 2014, according to a Post analysis of city comptroller data obtained through a Freedom of Information request. More than 400 cases are pending. One of the biggest payouts by the Health and Hospital Corp. system  3.2 million  went to the family of Georgia Thompson, who died six years after doctors at Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn ignored her tuberculosis diagnosis, then repeatedly botched her treatment, leading to a harrowing three-week decline that ended with her death of catastrophic organ failure in 2014, according to court documents.  In another Kings County case, Everton Lee of Brooklyn lost both his pregnant wife, Yvonna Harvell, and their unborn son in 2015 when physicians ignored Harvells past history of cardiac problems, failed to notice that an X-ray showed she had an enlarged heart and missed symptoms of peritonitis  a cascade of negligence that led to both deaths, according to court documents. The city paid the widower 900,000 in 2017. Kings County had the highest number of wrongful-death claims of any HHC hospital, with 91 filed from 2014 through 2018  far more than the 54 cases logged against No. 2, the much larger Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan.

This comes on the heels of the companys decision in 2016 to securely package all knives after a customer was stabbed inside a Poundland, another British grocery chain. For their part, Poundland stopped selling knives altogether last year. The grocery chains arent entirely incorrect  England does have a growing knife violence problem. However, regulating knives wont stop the violence. And, boy, does England have a growing knife violence problem. Over the first three months of 2019, England, with a population of just under 56 million, has seen 41 people killed by a knife based on this BBC report.

With all due caution, I think it can be an opportunity for our country. The upcoming meeting in Italy with the Chinese president will be an occasion to sign the framework accord. It doesnt mean that we will be bound the day after, but we will be able to enter and dialogue. Conte was referring to Italy possibly signing up for the Belt and Road Initiative, the new Silk Road, on which talks are at an advanced stage. If the deal goes through, Conte said he could rule out reprisals by US ratings agencies. China hopes Italy will go ahead and join its Belt and Road Initiative despite US pressure not to, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said earlier Friday. Historically, Italy was a stop on the Silk Road, said Wang. We welcome Italy and other European countries that are taking an active part in the Belt and Road Initiative. Italy is an independent country and we trust you will stick to the decision taken by you in an independent way, Wang said answering a question on outside pressure, especially from the US, on Rome joining the new Silk Road, where negotiations with Beijing are in their final stages.78 Italy 64,000 Shops Lost in 10 Yrs  Confcommercio79 45,000 more hotels and eateries ANSA  Rome, March 6  Italy has lost 64,000 shops in the last 10 years, retail group Confcommercio said Wednesday.

The NetBlocks Group, a private internet watchdog organization based in the UK, reported on Saturday that 96 percent of the country was offline.108 Venezuelas Long Road to Ruin109 Few Countries Have Provided Such a Perfect Example of Socialist Policies in Practice Word from Caracas is that locals have taken to scouring city streets for plastic garbage bags full of rubbish and, when they find them, emptying the contents so that they can resell the bags. This sounds absurd, but it is believable in a country where extreme poverty has spread like the plague. Human capital is fleeing. Oil production is plummeting, and the state-owned oil company is in default. The garbage bag, imported with dollars, is a thing of value. If anything was more predictable than the mess created by Hugo Chvezs Marxist Bolivarian Revolution, it is the pathetic effort by socialists to deny responsibility. The Socialist Party of Great Britain tweeted recently that Venezuelas problem is that socialism has yet to be tried. It blamed the crisis on a profit-driven capitalist economy under leftist state-control. Even more preposterous is the claim by some academics that economic liberalism in the 1980s spawned the socialism that has destroyed the country. Learning from history is impossible if the narrative is wrong. So lets clear the record By the time Chvez was elected, Venezuela already had 40 years of socialism under its belt and precious little, if any, experience with free markets. Military dictator Marcos Prez Jimnez was toppled in January 1958. Romulo Betancourt, an avowed socialist, was elected president later that year. When Venezuela promulgated its 1961 constitution, Betancourt immediately suspended Article 96, which read All can freely engage in the profitable activity of their choice, without any limitations other than those provided for in this Constitution and those established by law for security, health or other reasons of social interest. This crucial protection remained on the shelf for 30 years, as a string of socialist governments employed price and exchange controls in counterproductive attempts to raise living standards. Rent control in Venezuela dates to 1939 but was not enforced by Prez Jimnez. In August 1960 Betancourt revived it, passing a new rent-control law and prohibitions on eviction. Since then, not one apartment rental building has been built, writes Vladimir Chelminski in his 2017 book, Venezuelan Society Checkmated. The legendary slums that climb Caracass hillsides are a testament to this socialist stupidity.  Rafael Caldera took office for a second time in 1994 and restored price and exchange controls. By 1996, facing another collapse, he reversed course again, liberating prices and opening markets. The adjustment exposed reality but was painful, especially in the face of falling oil prices. Thus, the ground was fertile for an antiestablishment candidate in 1998. Chvez was inaugurated in February 1999, in the midst of a recovery in oil prices and with the bolivar at 576 to the dollar. He tripled down on socialism, exacerbating a long history of destroying capital that would lead to todays disaster. Appeared in the June 11, 2018, print edition as Venezuelas Long Road to Hell.

Biden immediately denounced the tragedy in Buffalo as a hate crime, racially-motivated act of white supremacy and violent extremism.

Musk, whos putting on hold his multibillion-dollar bid to buy Twitter over its true number of accounts, made the comment on a recent All-In podcast. The real president is whoever controls the teleprompter, he said. The path to power is the path to the teleprompter. He compared the situation to the 2004 TV news parody movie Anchorman. I do feel like if somebody were to accidentally lean on the teleprompter, its going to be like Anchorman, he said, referring to a running gag in the comedy in which Will Ferrells character, news anchor Ron Burgundy, will read anything presented to him on the teleprompter without a second thought. 108 Elon Musks Twitter Detractors Were Subsidized With 10.5 Million in Taxpayer Funds109 Topline Elon Musks deal to buy Twitter for 44 billion has 26 activist and progressive policy organizations urging the platforms advertisers to demand that Musk do as they say or face an advertising boycott.

Big number Those 26 organizations penned a letter at the beginning of May when they heard the Tesla Motors CEO was buying the social media company that banned then-President Donald Trump.

It shouldnt be much of a surprise that left-leaning speakers are prominent at college commencement ceremonies, but whats astonishing is that, in 2022, only three of the top 100 colleges and universities are featuring conservative speakers. 116 Husband Charged With Wifes Possible Mercy Killing In Burlington County, Officials Say117 PHILADELPHIA  An 84-year-old man is being charged with murder in the death of his wife.

And so far, the police have been successful in turning the tide, with Virginia already poised to drop a law banning facial scanning not even a year after it was adopted. In all, about 25 states now have this type of rule in place, but reports suggest that the future of these bills is far from certain. 136 Portland-Area Leftist Arrested for Child Sex Crimes, Urinating in Arbys Milkshake Mix at Work137 While investigating a Vancouver, Washington man for the possession and distribution of child pornography, police discovered that Stephen Sharp had taken a video of himself urinating into the milkshake mix at a local Arbys where he worked as a night shift manager.

The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with certified public accountant Michelle Cochran that she can go to federal court to challenge the constitutionality of the SECs system of in-house judges, without first exhausting what could be an endless series of unlawful agency hearings, her lawyers said.

The outlet added that the results reported by the researchers also found that the average American employee is now working 1.5 days per week from home, even as COVID cases continue to plunge worldwide. 146 Are Parents Rights Over Their Children Now at Risk in Quebec?147 In Quebec, it seems the government is using its majority to enact laws that increasingly restrict the rights and freedoms of its citizens. Indeed, Quebecs Bill 15, An Act to amend the Youth Protection Act and other legislative provisions, was adopted on April 14, 2022 and became law on April 26. This has many parents, and Quebecers in general, quite worried, since the amendment concerns the governments power over child custody. The law will prioritize the custody of children to the Director of Youth Protection instead of the childs natural family, consequently encroaching on parental rights. Therefore, any family involved with youth protection services could now lose custody of their child if the department deems it best for the childs health. However, the amendments brought to the bill are much more complex, thats why David Viva Frei Freiheit, a lawyer and YouTuber from Montreal, sat down with us to better explain the bills implications and to bring attention to what he considers a potential risk to our democracy. To see more from Viva Frei, you can find him on YouTube and Twitter! 148 Governing Bodies Unconcerned About Widely Shared, Flawed Data on COVID Transmission149 In this third report, I feature the responses received from governing bodies after a flawed modelling paper went viral a few weeks ago.

And another certainty is that the answer it comes up with will highly likely still be, no. But now, there is seemingly a desire to reverse the trend and once again have the police focus on dealing with actual crime, instead of, to all intents and purposes, getting involved in politics. Thats what UKs new chief inspector of constabulary, Andy Cooke, is saying, asserting that the countrys police should not act like the thought police, and unwittingly revealing how bad things have gotten by saying that officers must remember that different thoughts are not forbidden. 200 UK Extinction Rebellion Protesters Storm Five-Star Central London Hotel201 Extinction Rebellion activists have stormed a five-star hotel in central London in protest of an oil summit taking place on Tuesday.

It seems there is suddenly a movement in media to silence anyone who speaks out against George Soros  and, specifically, his funding of radical prosecutors seeking to change the criminal justice system by simply ignoring certain crimes. This happened to me personally this week while I was being interviewed on Foxs Outnumbered. When I brought up Soross plan to get pro-criminal, anti-police prosecutors elected across the country, two of the shows participants interrupted me and forcefully asserted that Soros was not involved.67 You Think Im Afraid of You?

How would you get started? And how best to turn it to your advantage and boost your profits? We have the answers right here. A simple 12 step plan. 1. Find some vague criteria for what constitutes the symptoms that you want people to look for. Anything subjective that a lot of people can identify with is ideal. Let us take memory problems andor confusion  a few common ones from the Covid list. Tiredness, aches and pains are common and subjective enough. For covid19 the symptoms are fever, dry cough, tiredness. Less common symptoms aches and pains, sore throat, diarrhoea, loss of taste or smell, a rash, or discolouration of fingers or toes It would be a good idea to take something that is very common in old people so that we can use death from old age as proof of the lethality of the new virus. 2. Then we would need something biological to test. Any RNA sequence would do, as long as it is not present in the whole population. If it were, someone might claim herd immunity very quickly. Actually it could be an RNA sequence that does not really exist in humans but something that could exist as contamination in labs, e.g. in dust or water. That would be enough for a RT qPCR test to pick up as a false positive. Many RT PCRs have false positive rates of 3-5  and that would be plenty to create a scare. When it comes to Covid, the false positive rate is impossible to know for sure, since we dont have a gold standard to check against, but for many other similar tests, the average false positive rate is over 3. And different labs are testing for different sequences. We can count on over-stressed labs to be more prone to contamination than labs taking part in research knowing they will be checked for accuracy, the ones that gave over 3 false positives. Maybe the error rate for the average stressed lab is as high as 8. BMJ counts 5 as a reasonable estimate. With 8 we would have all positive tests in the US explained by false positives 3. Then we are all set to go. We just have to claim that we have discovered a new cluster of symptoms and that is related to a new RNA sequence. It starts with memory loss, and confusion. In other words this is a neurotoxic virus, and it leads to death in all the ways old people can die, by strokes, heart attacks, pneumonia, kidney failure, sepsis, organ failure, dehydration. It doesnt matter if the patient was close to deaths door anyway, because of existing problems. We can always claim that without our new virus, they would not have died. Who could counter that? just like Covid People die from all kinds of disorders that they already had before the got the Covid test. 4. By some miracle we have already discovered exactly the virus that is responsible among the millions of different viruses that exist in any cubic centimeter of air. So we already have a RT PCR test read to go. This makes us look like very competent researchers. Of course we have bought stock in the major testing labs ahead of time. Weve bought stocks in the biggest vaccine manufacturers also of course. That will be the biggest money maker finally, hopefully for years since it will be difficult to get antibodies to something that doesnt really exist.

On Wednesday, Gingrich appeared on Outnumbered and accurately tied the nearly four months of rioting to leftist billionaire George Soros, who, over the past few years, has gone into a number of states to financially back progressive prosecutors, the very people making all this rioting possible. Bottom line these Soros-backed prosecutors are making the nonstop riots possible because they refuse to prosecute the rioters.-More99 Horrific Video Screaming Grandmother Manhandled by 8 Cops, Cuffed and Hauled Off for Not Wearing Mask at Anti-Lockdown Protest in Public Park100 Theyll tell you its for the greater good.

Suddenly, youve got government officials in this case, teachers or anyone at the school on the other end of that virtual connection being allowed carte blanche visual access to the inside of ones private home without a warrant. Anything those school officials see-anything they hear-anything they photograph or record-during that virtual visit becomes fair game for scrutiny and investigation not just by school officials but by every interconnected government agency to which that information can be relayed the police, social services, animal control, the Department of Homeland Security, you name it. After all, this is the age of overcriminalization, when the federal criminal code is so vast that the average American unknowingly commits about three federal felonies per day, a U.S. Attorney can find a way to charge just about anyone with violating federal law. Its a train wreck just waiting to happen.127 Woman Suspected of Mailing Ricin to White House Arrested at U.S.-Canada Border128 RCMP says initial information suggests that the letter originated in Canada Three U.S. law enforcement officials say a woman suspected of sending an envelope containing the poison ricin, which was addressed to White House and President Donald Trump, has been arrested at the New York-Canada border. The officials say the woman was taken into custody by U.S. Customs and Border Protection CBP officers and is expected to face federal charges. The officials were not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Aaron Bowker of the CBP confirmed with CBC News that the arrest took place at the Peace Bridge in Buffalo and that the individual was travelling from Canada into the U.S. The letter had been intercepted earlier this week before it reached the White House. An RCMP spokesperson told CBC News on Saturday that it was assisting the FBI in the investigation and that initial information from the investigation suggests that the letter originated in Canada.129130 BC Repeat Offender Charged With Assault of Two Children After Prison Release131 A BC man was arrested after allegedly assaulting two children at a public park only two days after he was released from custody. 50-year-old Bryan James Lamb has been charged with two counts of assault after the incident which took place at an Okanagan community park in Kaleden, BC.132 City-Wide Spike in Violent Crime Vancouver Police Department133 Another major Canadian city has been hit with a rising tide of violent crime during the coronavirus pandemic.

The report quotes sources from the US Africa Command and the US Office of the Inspector General. The same sources reveal that dozens of military advisors of the Turkish company SADAT are also in Libya, training the Syrian fighters and monitoring the day-to-day operations of Turkish-affiliated militias. Rumors around SADAT have started circulating shortly after the publication of the report, and some recent comments of the companys President Adnan Tanriverdi for the Daily Telegraph did not provide any further clarity. We shall now have a brief look into the company that according to many commentators could be the Turkish counterpart to the Russian Wagner Group on the Libyan front. Who is Adnan Tanriverdi? 154 March of 100,000 Marks Seventh Week of Belarus Protests155 KYIV, Ukraine  Tens of thousands of Belarusians calling for the countrys authoritarian president to resign marched through the capital Sunday as the countrys wave of protests entered its seventh week.

In an interview, a friend of Mairas family described how the family is in hiding and constantly on the run, adding Maira is traumatized. She cannot speak. We want to take her to the doctor, but we are afraid we might be spotted. We are all very frightened, but we place our trust in God.158 Thai Protesters Challenge Monarchy as Huge Protests Escalate159 BANGKOK Reuters  Openly challenging the monarchy of Thai King Maha Vajiralongkorn, thousands of protesters marched in Bangkok on Sunday to present demands that include a call for reforms to curb his powers. Protesters have grown ever bolder during two months of demonstrations against Thailands palace and military-dominated establishment, breaking a longstanding taboo on criticising the monarchy  which is illegal under lese majeste laws.

The world assumes it will never follow through. Yet as Beijing flexes its muscles at home and abroad, is that being dangerously complacent? Taiwans Foreign Minister Joseph Wu is ringing the alarm, hoping that the world will pay attention to the profound threat emanating from China. The threat is very real and therefore Taiwans preparation is also very serious, he told DW. We are trying to deal with the military threat, day in and day out. Chinas aggressive military probing has been going on for years  an unending stress test for the democratic island it claims as its territory. 164 1984 on Steroids Daniel Andrews is Slammed as He Prepares to Give Police Even More Powers and Refuses to Lift Lockdown  While Protecting Super-Spreader Families165 Daniel Andrews is being slammed for preparing to give police even more powers while refusing to lift lockdown, and defending a super-spreader family.166 Encrypted Messages, Scouts In the City and Rogue Police Officers Inside the Biggest Ever Anti-Lockdown Rally Set to Take Place in Melbourne167 Almost 700 demonstrators have organised to swarm the citys CBD on Sunday for a mass rally against the Victorian governments coronavirus restrictions.168 Spider-Like Venom Found in Australian Stinging Trees169 CNN Australia is synonymous with venomous spiders and snakes  but scientists have discovered new toxins in what they label a truly venomous plant.

We will abolish the Dublin rules and replace them with a new European migration management system, said von der Leyen. The current Dublin Regulation stipulates that asylum seekers must have their application processed in the country where they first arrive, but that could soon change. If the European Commission chooses to force migration quotas on member states, it is likely to face substantial pushback from countries opposed to illegal migration like Hungary and Poland, which recently joined five other European countries in a letter to the Commission voicing their opposition to migrant quotas.174 Majority of Germans Fear Taking Migrants From Greece Will Trigger New Migrant Wave175 A majority of Germans have expressed concern that the German government taking in large numbers of migrants from Greece after the Moria migrant camp fire could trigger a new wave of migration.

Murrays comments join those from WTA founder Billie Jean King to remove Courts name from one of the main stadiums at the Australian Opens Melbourne Park venue amid criticism of her beliefs from other senior figures in the sport.184 Netflixs Cuties Its Not the First Attempt by Hollywood to Normalize Pedophilia185 Hollywood has proven itself over the years to be a haven for evil people. Not so much in terms of the celebrities though many of them are narcissistic and sociopathic, but more in terms of the people that control the industry. The entire edifice was designed as a haven for subhuman tendencies. They have celebrated this openly in the past, though these days they pretend as if they are cleaning house. The machine of Hollywood is a vampires trap, a shining beacon luring in talented or at least hopeful and starstruck people, draining them of all life and then spitting them out once the feeding has finished. This is particularly true of children, and the number of cases of child abuse in the industry is staggering. If it were any other business, the media would be up in arms in terms of the number of convictions and allegations. If the fast food industry had as many pedo charges as Hollywood, the MSM would be writing thousands of articles a year admonishing the burger barn molestation epidemic. But when it comes to Hollywood, mainstream journalists rabidly defend the people at the top and attack critics as conspiracy theorists. The propensity for psychopaths to value children as their most sought after targets is well known. Its not necessarily always sexual, sometimes its only physical or mental abuse. But, children are a delicacy to them none-the-less. What could be more enthralling to evil than to destroy the life of a purely innocent person and take their childhood away? It is only in recent years that pedophilia in Hollywood has been taken more seriously by the general public. The Hollywood elites that dominate high level corporate positions have been the purveyors and controllers of Americas cultural expression for almost a century, and yet they are rarely subject to scrutiny. It is their own actions that have created the recent groundswell movement to root out organized child abuse I have now watched portions of this film, including dramatic story scenes to get a fair sense of the total content as well as come clips of the notorious scenes that have enraged the public. And, I can say WITHOUT A DOUBT, this film is in fact child pornagraphy according to the Department of Justices legal definition. A warning  I do NOT recommend watching this movie yourself, but if you do, be warned that the content is highly upsetting. If you heard from the mainstream media that the reaction to this film was overblown and part of a right wing conspiracy then Im here to tell you that you were lied to.186 Solar Panels Generate Mountains of Waste187 The problem of solar panel waste is now becoming evident. As environmental journalist Emily Folk admits in Renewable Energy Magazine, when talking about renewable energy, the topic of waste does not often appear. She attributes this to the supposed pressures of climate change and alleged urgency to find alternative energy sources, saying people may thus be hesitant to discuss possible negative impacts of renewable energy. Ms. Folk admits that sustainability requires proper e-waste management. Yet she laments, Solar presents a particular problem. There is growing evidence that broken panels release toxic pollutants and increasing concern regarding what happens with these materials when they are no longer viable, especially since they are difficult to recycle.188  1  2 420433  3 420387  4 420451  5 420393  6 420397  7 420425  8 420413  9 420447  10 420439  11 420443  12 420437  13 420411  14 420385  15 420429  16 420381  17 420415  18 420369  19 420361  20 420445  21 420423  22 420407  23 420409  24 420427  25 420365  26 420435  27 420373  28 420449  29 420383  30 420405  31 420379  32 420441  33 420391  34 420395  35 420401  36 420399  37 420461  38 420463  39 420419  40 420455  41 420375  42 420475  43 420457  44 420473  45 420477  46 420356  47 420453  48 420403  49 420459  50 420377  51 420355  52 420358  53 420417  54 420371  55 420471  56 420421  57 420467  58 420465  59 420469  60 420431  61 420479  62 420389  63 420363  64  65 topheadline  66  67 topheadline  68  69 topheadline  70  71 topheadline  72  73 topheadline  74  75 topheadline  76  77 topheadline  78  79 topheadline  80  81 topheadline  82  83 topheadline  84  85 topheadline  86  87 topheadline  88  89 topheadline  90  91 topheadline  92  93 topheadline  94  95 topheadline  96  97 topheadline  98  99 topheadline  100  101 topheadline  102  103 topheadline  104  105 topheadline  106  107 topheadline  108  109 topheadline  110 rzerohedgefeed3KAPWk7pcLv8shocking-claim-popular-childrens-app-requests-minor-take-naked-pictures  111 topheadline  112  113 topheadline  114  115 topheadline  116  117 topheadline  118  119 topheadline  120  121 topheadline  122  123 topheadline  124  125 topheadline  126  127 topheadline  128  129  130 topheadline  131  132 topheadline  133  134 topheadline  135  136 topheadline  137  138 topheadline  139  140 topheadline  141  142 topheadline  143  144 topheadline  145  146 topheadline  147  148 topheadline  149  150 topheadline  151  152 topheadline  153  154 topheadline  155  156 topheadline  157  158 topheadline  159  160 topheadline  161  162 topheadline  163  164 topheadline  165  166 topheadline  167  168 topheadline  169  170 topheadline  171  172 topheadline  173  174 topheadline  175  176 topheadline  177  178 topheadline  179  180 topheadline  181  182 topheadline  183  184 topheadline  185  186 topheadline  187  188 topheadline",homeless

There are two kinds of globalist schemes First, there are the schemes they spring on the public out of nowhere haphazardly in the hopes that the speed of the event along with some shock and awe will confuse the masses and make them psychologically pliable. This strategy loses effectiveness quickly, though the longer the plan takes to implement, the more time the people have to reconsider what is actually happening and why. Second, there are schemes they slowly implant in the collective psyche of the citizenry over many years, much like subliminal messaging or hypnosis. This strategy is designed to make the public embrace certain destructive ideologies or ideas as if these ideas were their own. The cryptocurrency scam is of the second variety. I have been suspicious of the cryptocurrency narrative of a decentralized and anonymous monetary revolution since 2009, when I was first approached by people claiming to be representatives of bitcoin and asked to become a promoter of the technology. After posing a few very simple questions and receiving no satisfactory answers, I declined to join the bandwagon or act as a frontman It was odd that bitcoin was built around the SHA-256 hash function created by the National Security Agency, and that the entire concept was remarkably similar to what was described in an NSA paper published in 1996 titled How To Make A Mint The Cryptography Of Anonymous Electronic Cash. Then, there were globalist institutions like Goldman Sachs coming out publicly in praise of crypto and blockchain tech. And, finally, central banks began entertaining the notion of moving into crypto, but they made it sound like they were approaching the idea half-heartedly, like it was a potential hobby. So what ties the entire crytpo-scheme together? The International Monetary Fund has now openly revealed their affinity with crypto technology, and thus revealed the new world order end game. In a paper published last week by IMF head Christine Lagarde titled Winds Of Change The Case For New Digital Currency, the IMF builds its argument for why central banks including the IMF should embrace crypto as the future of monetary policy. As I warned last year, the shift into crypto was not at all a revolution against the globalists, but a con designed by the globalists in part to get liberty proponents to become unwitting salesmen for the next phase of the economic control grid. But how do they intend this end game to play out?70 Eurozone Growth Stumbles, German Economy Contracts, Meanwhile UK Tops GDP Growth71 Eurozone growth remains slow, and has performed worse than expected in the latest figures released Friday which saw the Euro currency stumble as slowing German exports were shown to be behind the European powerhouses first GDP contraction since 2015.72 US Economy Unstoppable Thanks to Donald Trump73 US President Donald Trump received his highest approval rating on the economy, 53 per cent.

And now a mysterious new tool is enabling law enforcement authorities all over the nation to get access to that information on virtually any phone. So if you end up going to prison someday, it could be the evidence that is pulled out of your cellphone that ultimately puts you away. Of course most Americans never even consider that their own cellphones could be systematically gathering evidence against them. For most of us, cellphones are simply extremely convenient tools that allow us to communicate effectively with the rest of the world. But if the authorities decide to investigate you, your cellphone is going to be one of the first things that they want, and what they find on there could put you behind bars for a very, very long time. There are some people out there that are still operating under the assumption that the data on their cellphones is safe from the prying eyes of law enforcement authorities. That actually has not been true for a long time, and now a new tool is enabling them to unlock virtually any cellphone. The following comes from WHIO These are basically hacking devices, and it may take a number of hours, but they will eventually get into your cellphone. These hacking devices reportedly cost between 15,000 and 30,000, so they are quite expensive, but apparently law enforcement agencies all over the nation have been heavily buying them. Because if you can get into the cellphone of a suspect, it often provides everything that is needed to solve a case76 Democrats Use Vote Fraud to Play Their Last Hand Global Warming77 After two years of trying to pin the tail on the Donald to no avail, the democrats cranked up voter fraud to make a last ditch effort to suspend the workings of our Republic. With Florida receiving the lions share of the limelight of midterm election ballot mishandling, little attention has been paid to other states where vote irregularities have cropped up. From California, Arizona and New Mexico to Wisconsin and Georgia, numerous breaks in chain of custody of ballots has cast a shadow on the results of races for state and congressional seats. Every instance where republicans looked to have a solid or a tight lead, thousands of ballots appeared out of nowhere to be included in the final tally. Serendipitously discovered after the polls had been closed for hours, they added a glut of democrat votes that turned the tide in a number of California races. And election officials didnt even blink an eye. By the way, those officials were all affiliated with the democrat party.  Republicans had better take up the challenge and not rest until the vote fraudsters are incarcerated, otherwise Representative Matt Gaetz may be right that the Right is under siege and may lose the battle in 2020.78 Driver Stabbed in Hip in Edgewater Road Rage Incident79 Anne Arundel County police are searching for a woman and a teenager in connection with a stabbing during a road rage incident in Edgewater.

But rather than calls for redistribution, this global trend has prompted many electorates to respond with a surge of support for the far right. Income inequality has increased in nearly all regions of the world over the past four decades, according to the World Inequality Report 2018. Since 1980, the global top 1 percent of earners has experienced twice as much of the global growth as have the poorest 50 percent. While these ratios differ markedly between geographic regions with the least disparity in Western Europe and the most in the Middle East, the trend toward concentrating wealth among the rich remains constant. And although the bottom half has also experienced gains from global growth overall, the bottom 50 percent received just 10 percent of global income in 2016 versus the 20 percent that went to the top 1 percent. 106 Italy Braced for Wrath of Beaten All Blacks107 ROME AFP  Italy coach Conor OShea concedes his side are braced for a David against Goliath challenge against world champions New Zealand in their final November Test on Saturday at the Stadio Olimpico.

Nation states must today be prepared to give up their sovereignty, Merkel said, speaking at an event organised by the Konrad Adenauer Foundation in Berlin on Wednesday. In an orderly fashion of course, Merkel said, explaining that  while Germany had given up some of its sovereignty in order to join the EU, national parliaments were in charge of deciding whether to sign up to international treaties.

Both words throughout history described parties of the political left, of communism, socialism, and fascism, NEVER of the political right. You will never find socialist or workers appended to the names of any party on the right or the political center. What they had in common was, they all imposed CHANGE on their citizens with the promise of HOPE. The HOPE never materialized. The change always did. What followed was poverty, misery, and millions of dead. America avoided that bullet November 8th, 2016.116 Poland is Both Pro-European and Pro-American, Prime Minister Says117 Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and Germanys Federal Minister of Finance and Vice Chancellor Olaf Scholz together took part in a discussion in Hamburg entitled A European Perspective for the Future of Transatlantic Relations.118 Security Organisation Releases Report Slamming Swedish Electoral System119 The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE has criticised Swedens electoral system noting voter privacy concerns, missing ballots, and the way in which unions fund the Social Democrats.

At least two microchip firms  the U.K.s BioTeq and Swedens Biohax  have reported that they are working with several major British companies to insert the tiny, hidden information and tracking devices into the bodies of employees. The rice-grain sized chips are inserted between the thumb and the forefinger of employees, and are used by companies to ensure security at facilities and to store employee data. However, critics note that the chips can also be used to track individuals and to monitor their personal information without permission. The U.K. Independent reported that the use of microchips has become popular in Sweden, where more than 4,000 people have had chips implanted beneath their skin over the last five years through Biohax. A partnership with the Swedish national railway system means people are able to use the Biohax chips as a replacement for paper tickets and plastic travel cards. Biohax said that it is presently negotiating with a number of U.K. legal and financial companies, which want the chips implanted in employees to tighten up on security. These companies have sensitive documents they are dealing with, Biohax founder Jowan sterlund told the U.K. Telegraph. The chips would allow them to set restrictions for whoever. sterlund added that in a company with 200,000 employees, you can offer this as an opt-in. If you have a 15 percent uptake, that is still a huge number of people that wont require a physical ID pass. But critics fear that should companies gain momentum with the chips, they could do away with opt-in and require employees to take the chip. Comment No one should opt in. Let this satanic test run fail.130 UK Govt Pledges 50m to Stop FGM Abroad, Yet Still Zero Convictions for Cutters and Enablers at Home131 The British government has pledged an extra 5o million in foreign aid to stop female genital mutilation FGM globally  while the UK has failed to convict a single person despite thousands of victims reported annually.

Abuse cases are rarely publicized in the country, although Iran is a signatory of the UN convention on child rights. In a recent case in Iran, a victim anonymously posted a story on Twitter of abuse he experienced at the hands of a teacher 17 years prior. He was able to find support on social media from people who had similar experiences of abuse. He was inspired to finally share his story only after he saw a case of sexual abuse publicized in a news report from the southern Iranian city of Shoushtar. A gardener with psychiatric problems reportedly molested children and took pictures of his victims. A journalist published the pictures in the report. 140 ENI, Big Shot in the Gulf, Carried Out for the Piaggio Aero Affair?141 Eni has done a big hit obtaining a share of 25 of a large offshore concession of three fields in Abu Dhabi. Last November 13 Eni signed an agreement with the company of Abu Dhabi, Adnoc which provides for a share of 25 per cent in a mega offshore concession, the Ghasha, which includes three fields per trillion cubic meters of gas. When fully operational, writes La Stampa, the wells will be able to produce up to 1,5 billion cubic meters of gas per day and 120 thousand barrels of high-value condensates. This is how Enis CEO Claudio Descalzi confirms the confidence in our upstream model, based on the integration of exploration and development. Abu Dhabi has chosen the Italian company because it guaranteed a rapid transition from exploration to production, as was successfully done in Egypt with the Eastern Mediterranean gas field, the Zohr . Eni then signed an agreement with the Emirati company, Mubadala the sovereign fund Mubadala is interested in the construction of the Piaggio Aero drone P.2HH, for the sale of 20 per cent of the Eni share in the Nour concession, off the Delta del Nile in Egypt. Egypt and Israel, however, always writes the press, have signed an agreement to bring Israeli gas on the Egyptian coast, where, in Damietta, there is a large plant for liquefaction of ENI that could become a hub for transport to all Europe. Russia, in all this business, is not watching and Vladimir Putin intends to set up a military base in Egypt and probably also in Tobruk. Eni and Italy can thus counter the French expansion from the South, where gigantic deposits of gas exist yet to be explored and thus restore equilibrium in the Libyan Fezzan. What is certain is that with this agreement the negotiations for the construction of the Piaggio Aero drone should also be unblocked, ensuring the continuation of the Italian companys activities and the retention of the seats of 1200 workers. Piaggio has put in place a new drone, the P.2HH, with the aim of selling it to both the emirates and the Italian Air Force for a cost of 766 million euros that should be taken over by the Italian government and paid in 15 years , for the development and purchase of 20 aircraft and 10 ground stations. The same sum would be assured by Abu Dhabi. The slowdowns in the funding of the program had annoyed and not a little Abu Dhabi that would have sensitized Italian politicians and soldiers so that Leonardo could enter Piaggio as soon as possible.142 Sydney ISIS Terrorist Ahmed Merhi Claims He Was a Volunteer Nurse and Didnt Fight  as Details of His Squalid Cell Are Revealed While He Awaits Death by Hanging in Iraq143 Sydney terrorist Ahmed Merhi who has been sentenced to death in Iraq is being held in a crammed prison cell while he tries to whitewash his history with Islamic State.144 Turkey Says EU Overstepped Brief by Calling for Kurdish Leaders Release145 ANKARA AFP  Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu on Friday accused the European Unions top diplomat of overstepping her brief by calling for the release of jailed Kurdish leader Selahattin Demirtas.

Dolce ...bbana were boycotted by the three Chinese giants in the sector, Tmall, JD.com and Suning, cross-border operators NetEase Kaola and Ymatou, and luxury e-commerce companies such as Secoo, Vip.com and Yhd.com, media outlets and shopping platforms said. Due to the row, Dolce ...bbana on Wednesday had to call off a major show in Shanghai, just hours before it was scheduled to begin, as several celebrities said they would not be attending. Meanwhile a Beijing government official said Thursday that the clamor about the advertising campaign that has offended many people in China must not become a diplomatic case. That is not a diplomatic question and I wont let it become a diplomatic question, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang told a press conference when asked about the case. The controversy arose after videos posted on the Italian fashion brands Instagram, Facebook and Twitter accounts, as well as its Weibo profile in China. In the first video published on Sunday, a young model in a red dress attempts to eat pizza with chopsticks. She prods the pizza to the sound of stereotypical Chinese music, before a narrator offers advice such as just use your chopsticks like pliers. In the second and third episodes of the campaign, the same model tries to eat a cannoli and a bowl of spaghetti and this time the narrator appears to mispronounce the brands name, with some seeing this as a way of poking fun at the Chinese pronunciation of Dolce ...bbana. Also, a voiceover asked is it too big for you? while the model attempted to eat cannoli. The videos sparked a social media outcry Weibo users accused the label of trivializing the countrys culture and depicting Chinese women in a racist and sexist way. The young woman in the video was said to have a stereotypical naive appearance with small eyes, and she was described using double entendres. The video for The Great Show was taken down within 24 hours but it had already been shared widely on social media, where the hashtag BoycottDolce began to circulate. In addition, Gabbana was quoted as describing China as a foul-smelling, dirty and ignorant mafia in private Instagram comments that the recipient made public. The messages quickly went viral on social media The fashion house has said its account and that of Gabbana had been hacked and denied posting the messages. We are very sorry for any distress caused by these unauthorized posts, the company said on its Instagram account. We have nothing but respect for China and the people of China. On his personal account, Gabbana pasted the words not me over images of the alleged derogatory comments.

Theyre an invading army, posing as refugees seeking asylum because they fear being killed, seeking illegal entry into the United States. Who and what the migrants are was the bone of contention that led to Acostas temporary suspension from the White House press room. Trump had called them an invasion force of illegal aliens. Acosta said they were refugees. Trump was right. The spokesman for an open borders group trying to push the migrants into the United States said they intend to storm the border and force their way into the country. Human Stampede Coming The migrant horde, as the mayor of Tijuana called it, is using his town to stage their final push into the United States. Tijuanans are angry about the deluge of migrants that are befouling their city, and have confronted the mostly Honduran invasion force by singing the Mexican anthem and raising the Mexican flag. Out! Out! theyve shouted. Problem is, when they are out, the migrants dont plan to march home. Theyre coming here. They plan to stampede the border and simply enter the United States illegally, as President Trump has been warning Early this week, a leftist federal judge blocked Trumps order to deny asylum claims to the illegal-alien border, but the U.S. Supreme Court has said the president has the authority to decide who enters the country.

A second UN agreement on refugees is also now under fire, with the far right saying it will facilitate an unregulated refugee influx. There are currently around 68 million displaced people worldwide, according to the United Nations. Most of those are internally displaced, still in their own country but driven from their homes. But some 25 million have fled across borders and entered neighboring countries, or to countries further afield. Nearly 70 years after the passing of the Geneva convention on refugees in 1951, these figures are at a record high. To combat this suffering, the UN Global Compact on Refugees GCR intends to bundle international efforts. Its aim is to improve living conditions for refugees and provide relief to host countries. 188 Swedish Government Spent 1000 on Rent Per Migrant  Per Day189 While tens of thousands of elderly Swedes are homeless, and over 300,000 pensioners are starving, the Swedish government spent 1000 a day on rent per migrant. In 2015, Stockholm hosted a number of unaccompanied refugee children. Entrepreneurs requested up to 1000 in rent per migrant from the city, which did not protest, but with taxpayers money paid the price requested.190 Tijuana Mayor Declares Crisis at Border DHS Warns of Criminals, Gang Members Among Caravan191 The mayor of Tijuana declared an international humanitarian crisis on Thursday following the arrival of more than 6,200 mostly Central American migrants  with more on the way. During a press conference, Mayor Juan Manuel Gastlum called on the United Nations and other international groups to step in and assist with the massive influx of migrants, reports AZ Central. Up to 10,000 migrants could eventually end up in Tijuana, according to the federal government.192 Trump Signs Order Closing Border With Mexico, Authorizing Lethal Force193 Yesterday we reported that president Trump had authorized troops stationed at the border to act in a law enforcement capacity to perform those military protective activities that the Secretary of Defense determines are reasonably necessary to protect border agents, including a show or use of force including lethal force, where necessary, crowd control, temporary detention. and cursory search. That wasnt all speaking to reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, the president said on Thursday that he also signed an order to close the U.S. border with Mexico, adding that hes authorized troops to use lethal force against migrants who attempt to enter the U.S. If they have to, Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, claiming that at least 500 criminals are among migrants trying to enter the U.S. So Im not going to let the military be taken advantage of. I have no choice. Do I want that to happen? Absolutely not. But youre dealing with rough people. Trump also said that he would welcome a partial shutdown of the government over border security. According to Bloomberg, Trump signed the order two days ago and that Ive already shutdown parts of the border warning that the entire border may be closed if conflict with migrants escalates. If we find that its uncontrollable, he said, if we find that it gets to a level where we are going to lose control or people are going to start getting hurt, we will close entry into the country for a period of time until we can get it under control. The whole border, he clarified. I mean the whole border. And Mexico will not be able to sell their cars into the United States where they make so many cars at great benefit to them, not at great benefit to us. Still, details were missing as the White House hasnt released the order and Trump wasnt clear about his directive.194 UK Two Migrant Boats Land in Kent as Brazen Sea Crossings Surge195 Two dinghies carrying 14 illegal migrants have been picked up by the coastguard near the Kent coast. UK Border Force intercepted one dinghy carrying six men and one woman at around 130 am on Thursday, all of whom presented themselves as Iranian, the Home Office said in a statement.196 UK Theresa May Pledges to Curb Low-Skilled Migration Only the Brightest and the Best197 The Prime Minister is heading to Brussels tomorrow for a crucial EU summit, when the 27 EU leaders will vote on the Brexit draft withdrawal agreement. If the vote passes, the next hurdle will be to get the draft through the House of Commons. Ahead of the critical talks, Mrs May will announce curbs on low-skilled migrants and plans to abolish the cap on highly-skilled workers so that the UK will attract the brightest and the best, The Telegraph reported.198 Parents Outraged Over Transgendered Sexualization of 5-Year-Olds199 Sex training targeting younger and younger children accelerates Public schools across America are pushing transgendered sexual education on children as young as five. Alex Jones reports200 200-Million-Year-Old Huge Mammal Disrupts Evolution Theory201 Large mammals were theoretically not supposed to have existed around then Remains of an ancient mammal which was the size of an elephant and lived 200 million years ago has been discovered, throwing scientists understanding of evolution into question. The massive herbivore is believed to have existed in the Triassic Period some 200 million years ago. What is odd about the finding is that large mammals were not supposed to have existed at this point. Scientists had believed that large mammals died out at the end of the Permian Period 251.9 million years ago. After this, only smaller mammals existed as the dinosaurs became the dominant species on Earth, with mammals regaining the crown about 50 million years ago.202 Astronomers Detected Water on a Planet Only 179 Light-Years Away, And its a Big Step in Understanding Surrounding Exoplanets203 Gathering detailed information on exoplanets is extremely difficult. The light from their host star overwhelms the light from the exoplanet, making it difficult for telescopes to see them. But now a team using cutting-edge technology at the Keck Observatory has taken a big leap in exoplanet observation and has detected water in the atmosphere of a planet 179 light years away. The solar system at the heart of this features a star called HR 8799, and its planets HR 8799 b, c, d, and e. The system is 179 light years away in the constellation Pegasus.204  1 335380  2 335437  3 335411  4 335372  5 335364  6 335326  7 335384  8 335441  9 335413  10 335439  11 335368  12 335419  13 335358  14 335409  15 335407  16 335459  17 335399  18 335401  19 335332  20 335339  21 335397  22 335352  23 335389  24 335366  25 335403  26 335423  27 335443  28 335405  29 335415  30 335391  31 335378  32 335429  33 335433  34 335435  35 335362  36 335335  37 335333  38 335330  39 335341  40 335417  41 335340  42 335338  43 335337  44 335328  45 335349  46 335347  47 335345  48 335343  49 335453  50 335457  51 335455  52 335395  53 335370  54 335354  55 335447  56 335334  57 335425  58 335421  59 335374  60 335336  61 335387  62 335451  63 335376  64 335431  65 335445  66 335360  67 335356  68 335449  69  70 topheadline  71  72 topheadline  73 .W_iOQmkbcPU.twitter  74 topheadline  75  76 topheadline  77  78 topheadline  79  80 topheadline  81  82 topheadline  83  84 topheadline  85  86 topheadline  87  88 topheadline  89  90 topheadline  91  92 topheadline  93  94 topheadline  95  96 topheadline  97  98 topheadline  99  100 topheadline  101  102 topheadline  103  104 topheadline  105  106 topheadline  107  108 topheadline  109  110 topheadline  111  112 topheadline  113  114 topheadline  115  116 topheadline  117  118 topheadline  119  120 topheadline  121  122 topheadline  123  124 topheadline  125  126 topheadline  127  128 topheadline  129  130 topheadline  131  132 topheadline  133  134 topheadline  135  136 topheadline  137  138 topheadline  139  140 topheadline  141  142 topheadline  143  144 topheadline  145  146 topheadline  147  148 topheadline  149  150 topheadline  151  152 topheadline  153  154 topheadline  155  156 topheadline  157  158 topheadline  159  160 topheadline  161  162 topheadline  163  164 topheadline  165  166 topheadline  167  168 topheadline  169  170 topheadline  171  172 topheadline  173  174 topheadline  175  176 topheadline  177  178 topheadline  179  180 topheadline  181  182 topheadline  183  184 topheadline  185  186 topheadline  187  188 topheadline  189  190 topheadline  191  192 topheadline  193  194 topheadline  195  196 topheadline  197  198 topheadline  199  200 topheadline  201  202 topheadline  203  204 topheadline",homeless
baltimore,"Slick, Misleading TV Ads Paid Off",2016-08-18T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,WBAL,"The campaign demonstrated that despite a changing society increasingly consumed by social media and online video, television remains a potent, persuasive force, even for disruptive tech giants like Airbnb. The record off-year campaign spending  which totaled 27.8 million for all measures and candidates  also offers a preview of what is expected to be an even bigger media onslaught this year, as a presidential election draws more voters to the polls. In November, multiple seats will be up for grabs at the citys Board of Supervisors, and at least one likely ballot initiative threatens the soda industry, which has a history of throwing big sums into local elections to protect its bottom line. By Election Day 2015, more than 6.4 million had been poured into TV advertising alone for five ballot initiatives and three candidate races Propositions A, D, E, F and I, as well as the contests for mayor, sheriff and District 3 supervisor1. The vast majority of that money went to defeating Proposition F2, which tried unsuccessfully to expand regulations on short-term rentals of homes and apartments. The No on F campaign, funded chiefly by San Francisco-based Airbnb, outspent proponents on television 45-to-1, buying nearly two hours of opposition advertising for every minute of Yes on F ads, based on a San Francisco Public Press review of TV advertising, which included national and local stations. Shaped by national political consultants, the big-money campaigns created an echo chamber, aided by local broadcasters. Superficial TV reporting parroted claims in the ads, which were notable for distorting or obscuring facts, attacking a candidates character or conjuring menacing images of Big Brother intrusions into peoples bedrooms and personal information. Misrepresentations big and small pervaded the airwaves Claims inaccurately attributed to the official ballot initiative text of Proposition F An attack on District 3 challenger Aaron Peskin, who was seeking to regain his old seat from the supervisor Mayor Ed Lee had installed. The ad portrayed the Board of Supervisors former president  and mayoral foe  as an aggressive late-night caller A questionable claim that Lees 310 million housing bond, Proposition A, would not cost taxpayers anything. Campaign ad makers arent interested in accurate sources, but they want those facts in there, they want a newspaper quote, they want some sort of backup information, said Michael Franz3, co-author of The Persuasive Power of Campaign Advertising4. They might cite some sort of voting records, but youre not going to get the exact citation that would let you easily track down the information, he said. Its a feature of our ads  theres too much info in politics today to fact-check all of this. To Franz, that information overload poses a challenge to democracy. Organized groups are sending out information at light speed, and in a sense this is a crisis of journalism, he said. How to help voters sort through it. Analyzing the Ads The Public Press collaborated with the Internet Archive5, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that catalogs electronic media worldwide, to analyze 27 distinct TV spots that aired on 11 stations during the fall campaign. We looked closely at five Bay Area stations that accounted for more than half of the airtime for the ads and virtually all the televised news coverage of the election KPIX, KRON, KGO, KTVU and KNTV. Ads also ran on Chinese-language station KTSF but were not reviewed. All told, almost 26 hours of ads ran on these five stations from after Labor Day until Election Day, compared with a total of 3.5 hours of TV news coverage  a ratio of about 7-to-1. Of the total ad time, No on F dominated with about 20 hours, compared with 16 minutes for the Yes effort  a 76-to-1 imbalance. By far the most contentious citywide issue was Proposition F. Sponsored by ShareBetter SF, the initiative tried to toughen the ordinance, passed and signed in October 2014, that legalized short-term rentals and established a system of registration and taxation. Though renters still widely outnumber homeowners in San Francisco, many from both groups are united in the opportunity to reap windfalls from short-term rentals, even though they may contribute to rising costs and the overall housing crisis. The campaign to defeat Proposition F pitted Lee, Airbnb, real estate interests, tech venture capitalist Ron Conway6 and some labor unions against tenant activists, neighborhood groups, hotel unions and wealthy property owners, who were badly outgunned and outspent on all media. Airbnb led the No on F television blitz, ponying up 4.7 million in TV buys alone to beat back broader control of its business model, according to city data. The Yes campaign mustered only about 104,000 for television, and about 1.1 million overall. All told, Airbnb spent more than 9 million to be victorious. That number has been exceeded only once since San Francisco began reliably tracking campaign finances online in 1998 when PG...pent 11 million to defeat a renewable-energy measure in 2008. The campaign had all the modern bells and whistles you would expect of an effort backed by a Silicon Valley giant, No on F consultant Nicole Derse, co-founder of 501 Strategies, wrote in the online journal Campaigns ...ections7 in January. Casting doubts on Proposition F Crucial to victory were several slick, 30- and 15-second TV spots that skillfully  if misleadingly  sowed doubts about Proposition F. To craft more than a dozen complementary TV ads, San Francisco for Everyone  No on F, funded primarily by Airbnb, turned to noted Democratic strategist Joe Slade White ....8 Based outside Buffalo, N.Y., the firm has deep ties to the party and top Democrats, including Vice President Joe Biden, Gov. Jerry Brown and state Attorney General Kamala Harris. White worked on George McGoverns failed 1972 campaign against President Richard Nixon. Bidens sister, Valerie, is the firms executive vice president. Joe Slade White has also handled media campaigns for AT...Uber and other corporate heavyweights. It boasts that it has not lost a ballot initiative in 18 years. Following the firms much admired playbook  9 Principles of Winning Campaigns9  No on F proponents worked to create uncertainty about the measure before going in for the kill. We start with the simple notion that campaigns cannot move a No to a Yes or vice versa, Joe Slade White declared. You must first move initiative voters to undecided. Only then can you persuade them the rest of the way. Vice President Biden has called White the preeminent storyteller who makes voters want to listen. In July, a poll by David Binder Research10, which was hired by the No on F campaign, showed public opinion was almost evenly divided. In September, No on F cranked up the volume, running 12.5 hours of ads, about 60 percent on local stations. The Yes campaign was silent, airing not a single spot all month, the Public Press analysis found. The barrage paid off, according to Binder polling in mid-September. No led by 16 points. After just three weeks our No vote jumped to a dramatic double-digit lead while the Yes vote dropped like a rock, Joe Slade Whites website said. In Prop. F, we focused on a broad theme that the proposal was just too extreme, Ben Nuckels, senior vice president of Joe Slade White, told the Public Press. Strategically, we had undermined the Yes on Prop. F before our opponents could react. That made it ultimately impossible for them ever to fully recover or to ever regain the lead. The No on F blitz hammered home the idea that the measure was just too extreme, a new threat that would violate peoples privacy, encourage spying on your neighbors and result in thousands of new lawsuits. The ads capitalized on growing concerns about privacy, personal rights and government intrusion following revelations that the National Security Agency was amassing phone and email data on Americans in its efforts to thwart terrorism. Lee and his predecessor, Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, smoothly reinforced the themes that the measure goes too far and is just too extreme. Allied with five supervisors, the Democratic and Republican parties, the Chamber of Commerce and others, they trumped a long list of influential Yes on F backers that included Sen. Dianne Feinstein former mayor Art Agnos five city supervisors Democratic clubs teachers, nurses and hotel workers unions tenants rights groups and neighborhood associations. The way people learn is through endorsements, said Jason McDaniel11, a political scientist at San Francisco State University who specializes in urban politics and voting behavior. People are generally skeptical of ballot propositions if there is opposition. Thats the endorsement thing. Its not the ad, its the endorsements, he added. You can spend a lot of money to make those endorsements obvious, or that conflict obvious. Then people are skeptical and it fails to pass. Leave spying to the movies Beyond endorsements, memorable Joe Slade White spots turned to the dark side to cast Proposition F as a sinister Big Government effort to monitor residents bedrooms and create personal dossiers. One depicted a creepy neighbor peering through night-vision-like binoculars at Victorian houses, followed by images of aerial surveillance video and a data scan of a palm print. Lets leave the spying to the movies, not the neighbors, the narrator said over a James Bondian soundtrack of surf guitar. Another spot showed shadowy fingers on a laptop keyboard as the narrator warned that the initiative would allow the government to collect peoples private information. Voters were never told that the existing ordinance12 already required hosts to register with the city13 and maintain quarterly records of their residency and rentals, thereby compelling them to share certain private information demonstrating primary residency, the number of days they occupied their unit, and the dates and the duration of each short-term rental. As it stood, last years ordinance required that the city create a registry of short-term-rental hosts and that the information shall be available for public review to the extent required by law  with one exception to the extent permitted by law, the Planning Department shall redact any Permanent Resident names from the records available for public review. San Francisco is not alone Portland, Ore., officials may subpoena much more personal information to enforce the citys short-term-rental laws, including phone, tax, vehicle and real estate records. Another notable ad was called Night, featuring the simple imagery of a half-asleep woman between crisp white sheets. What if the government required you to report when youre sleeping in your own home, or even in your own bed? a gravelly male voice narrated over the tune Lullaby and Goodnight. If Prop. F passes, San Francisco will be the only city in the country where residents will be forced to do just that. The ominous warnings in both ads were attributed to the Official Text San Francisco Measure F and Consumer Watchdog14  a nonprofit advocacy group listed as an ongoing client of Sheri Sadler, the media buyer for No on F. MANIPULATION AND MESSAGING The truth, however, was something else. Nowhere in the official ballot text15  which amended the existing code covering short-term rentals  did it require hosts using Airbnb, Homeshare or VRBO to report when they were sleeping in their own homes or beds. Proposition F reiterated the language from the ordinance backed by Lee, approved by supervisors and enacted in February 2015 quarterly reporting of the number of days a primary residence was occupied and the days it was rented out. No bed checks. Consider that if you go out of town for a weekend or two months, you are still considered to be legally occupying your home or apartment, even if you were away or let friends or family occupy it in your absence. Certainly, not all San Francisco residents read the official ballot text or the new ordinance that took effect months earlier. The initiative just went further, too far for a majority of voters who turned out. Some of the most controversial provisions called for cutting annual short-term rentals from 90 days to 75 banning use of in-law units tightening registration and reporting, and bolstering the neighbor complaint process and enforcement by bringing Airbnb and its rivals into the process. Additionally, residents would have needed permission to operate as a bed and breakfast for rentals beyond 75 days. The No on F campaign apparently persuaded many voters to believe that it would be the ballot measure that would make already existing provisions law. And Airbnb disguised two of its biggest concerns, which it had fought to keep out of the ordinance Lee signed in October 2014. Not surprisingly, the No campaign did not point out that the Proposition F would have required Airbnb and its competitors to closely monitor listings and remove illegal units and those that had been rented out for more than 75 days over the course of a year. Failure to do so could have resulted in fines up to 1,000 a day per listing, potentially costing Airbnb and the others tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars. Proposition F also would have cleared the way for residents and other interested parties  neighbors and landlords among them  to directly sue Airbnb and its competitors, which under the current law can be done only by the City Attorneys Office. The opposition took no chances on finding the most potent message. Yes ads were also created to test against focus groups watching No spots, said Nuckels, of Joe Slade White. There was one ad we produced to test for the yes side that would have likely won the race for them had they aired it, he said, without revealing the ads content. Our opponents greatest strength was the simplicity of their message  the housing crisis  and, frankly, they swung and missed. The Yes on F campaign mustered only one TV ad. It claimed that illegal Airbnb hotels were evicting thousands of San Franciscans from their homes and causing rents to skyrocket, citing news articles in the San Francisco Examiner and the New York Times. Neither article contained the ads wording, however, and its claims have not been established conclusively. Nearly three-quarters of San Francisco units are covered by rent control, and it is illegal for landlords to evict tenants and begin renting to visitors. Although evictions jumped between 2011 and 2014, the Rent Board16 reported, it is not known whether the units were subsequently rented out to visitors or to new long-term tenants at much higher market rates. In a May 2015 report, the San Francisco Budget and Legislative Analyst17s office estimated that Airbnb listings may have been responsible for removing between 925 and 1,960 housing units from the residential market, based on data from 2013 and 2014. That could represent between 11 percent and 23.2 percent of the citys vacant housing units, the report said, noting that its estimates and conclusions were conservative and understate the full short-term rental market by an unknown amount. Regardless of the accuracy of the ads claims, it was virtually invisible compared with the No onslaught. For all of October, the Yes ad aired a total of only 16 minutes. Ultimately, the No on F ads epitomized the art of political persuasion and spin. Night earned industry recognition and awards18 for the campaign team  Joe Slade White, 501 Strategies19, San Francisco media buyer Sadler Strategic20, campaign manager Patrick Hannan and senior adviser Chris Lehane21, Airbnbs head of global policy and public affairs and an adviser in the Clinton White House. TV was not the only vehicle the campaign used to drum up opposition to F, however. We sent 16 pieces of mail to a universe of approximately 100,000 households and made sure it mirrored the content of the TV ads, wrote Derse, of San Francisco-based 501 Strategies. We put up massive campaign billboards around town using the same binocular image of the spying neighbor that voters saw in the TV ads and in their mailboxes. And we ran a robust online campaign led by Social Stream to reach those same voters digitally. We also ran one of the most aggressive field campaigns San Francisco has ever seen, she added. Over the course of 11 weeks, our staff and volunteers knocked on more than 300,000 doors, made some 300,000 phone calls and had over 120,000 conversations with real voters. Two key voting blocs were targeted Chinese-Americans, who she said disproportionately owned and occupied the in-law units that would be banned, and young voters, our largest group of supporters, though one with a historically low turnout in off-year voting. Airbnbs roughly 138,000 users in the city played a big role, Derse explained, hosting house parties, organizing their friends and neighbors, and leading dozens of earned media events. In the end, Proposition F was trounced, 56 percent to 44 percent. Airbnb did not reply to questions about its ads. For privately held Airbnb, with an estimated value greater than 25 billion, the ads were money well spent in its hometown, the poster child for tight, expensive housing. The results demonstrated Airbnbs popularity and growing influence in spite  or because  of the housing crisis. As the company extends its reach, driven by a new generation, technology and an economy in flux, the campaign may offer a blueprint for success. Mad Man attack on Peskin No on F wasnt the only campaign that used a combination of well-funded research, technology and distortion to create a negative image. In the District 3 battle, incumbent Julie Christensen and her allies slightly outspent Arron Peskin to try to prevent him from reclaiming his seat, which he had held from 2001 to 2009. In the end, the race cost 2.1 million, a record for a supervisorial contest, according to San Francisco Ethics Commission22 data. The Committee for a Progressive and Affordable San Francisco Opposing Peskin for Supervisor 2015, backed mainly by Conway, spent 313,380 in the failed bid to take down Peskin, according to Ethics Commission filings. Mark Armour of Armour Media23 was hired to create an anti-Peskin spot. He modeled it after the hit show Mad Men. Armour used Peskins past behavior  notably instances of bad temper and apparent intoxication  to undermine his bid, albeit unsuccessfully. In the ad, Armour cited a San Francisco Chronicle column that had quoted Lee, criticizing Peskin for his reputedly aggressive behavior with his City Hall colleagues see The Most Misleading Political Ads of 201524. The mayor had appointed Christensen to a vacancy and was pulling out all the stops to get her elected to a full term. Taken out of context, the quote was, at best, misleading. As a creative guy, I have two messages, said Armour, whose work includes campaigns that elected presidents Obama and Clinton, and Sen. Barbara Boxer. One, this is a candidate who has a history of drinking and going off on city employees, and two, Ive got a narrative about a throwback to the past  a former supervisor who had gotten out of office versus a new candidate. And while the ad didnt stop Peskin  who had vacated the seat because of term limits  from winning the campaign, it presented him as an obstructionist, a characterization that Armour believes will stick. His opponents should be emboldened from the campaign because it was such a narrow win, said Armour, whose Mad Man won an industry award for the Best Ad for Independent Expenditure Campaign25. He added that bringing up Peskins previous mistakes forced him to express contrition about his past and pledge to operate differently. Peskins team fired back, hitting Conways contribution to Armours attack. Tech billionaire Ron Conway says Aaron Peskin is a mad man, the rebuttal stated, as a segment of the Mad Men ad played in the background beside a photo of Conway looking off into the distance. The spot claimed that Conway had spent 128,250 to smear Aaron Peskin. Peskin regained his seat, handily defeating Christensen by 9 percentage points, a bitter defeat for the mayor, Conway and their allies. Misleading claim for Proposition A One other major measure also relied on misleading information to persuade voters. Proposition A ads claimed that the mayors 310 million housing bond would not raise taxes. The Yes on A campaign ran 10.5 hours of ads on stations that aired in the Bay Area. There was no opposition on TV. The claim that Proposition A26 would not raise taxes was reinforced in a commercial narrated by Lee, who reassured viewers that the proposition would build critically needed homes for low- and middle-income San Franciscans without raising taxes. But according to a July report from the city Controllers office27, the no-new-taxes claim would be nearly impossible to keep. The report states that if implemented, Proposition A would cause the city to raise property taxes from fiscal years 2015-2016 through 2038-2039 by an annual average of 8.09 per 100,000 of assessed valuation, according to the city controllers best estimate. That would be an additional 89 a year for a 1.1 million dwelling, the median home price as of May 2016. In the Public PressInternet Archive review of Proposition A coverage, only one TV news segment we identified, Reality Check With Sam Brock28 on KNTV, addressed its discrepancies. For four minutes, Brock deconstructed the ballot initiative, stating that Lees promise of no additional taxes was unfounded. The segment, which first aired Oct. 23, was repeated eight days later. It was the most comprehensive look at any of the 2015 propositions by the five news stations, our research found. Former KTVU political reporter Randy Shandobil29, who worked on Airbnb ads early in the campaign, said it has become more difficult to be a watchdog in the news environment of today because of staff cuts at TV stations, increased competition from digital sources and a near-24-hour news cycle. The stations are still profitable, but theyve got to feed the beast because their costs are higher, he said. That includes political reporters, who are more expensive than their general-assignment counterparts. They could spend more money on hiring staff but they dont, he added. Because news programs are driven by ratings and increasingly forced into short, simple formats, Shandobil said, it is easier for a campaign to bamboozle voters.

Earlier this month British Petroleum BP released its Statistical Review of World Energy for 2019 in which it reported that the United States extended its lead as the worlds top oil producer to a record 15.3 million bpd barrels per day 11 million bpd of crude and 4.3 million bpd of natural gas liquids NGL in April. BP added that the United States led all global oil producers by increasing its production by more than two million bpd in 2018, 98 percent of the total new global production.51 Antifa Activist Identified as Man Armed With Rifle Who Tried to Set Fire to ICE Center52 Yesterday, a man armed with a rifle and Molotov cocktails at the ICE Tacoma Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, Wash., was killed by responding police officers, according to the authorities. At around 4 a.m. on Saturday, the Washington State man threw incendiary devices at the ICE detention center and nearby cars, setting one on fire. The male attempted to ignite a large propane tank and set out buildings on fire, a statement released by the Tacoma police department said. The male continued throwing lit objects at the buildings and cars. Four officers arrived at the scene and were involved in the shooting. Police initially called out to the man and then shots were fired. It remains unclear who began firing first. An ICE spokesperson confirmed that no employees were hurt at the shooting, according to The Daily Beast. The man who attacked the ICE center has now been identified as 69-year-old Willem Van Spronsen of Vashon Island, Washington.53 Brownback Wants Religious Freedom Summit to Spark Global Grassroots Movement54 WASHINGTON RNS  As he prepared for the State Departments second summit on global religious liberty next week, Sam Brownback, the U.S. ambassador on religious freedom issues, defended the event against critics who say that the first summit failed to accomplish more than creating new statements about helping religious minorities. In a telephone briefing with reporters on Friday July 12, Brownback, the U.S. ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom, cited efforts in Iraq, where a partnership that includes the U.S. Agency for International Development has begun to assist the redevelopment and repopulating of northern Iraq by Yazidis and Christians that had been run out during ISIS.55 Democratic Governor Blames Trump for Leftist Who Firebombed ICE Facility56 The Democratic Governor of Washington State believes there is one person to blame for an incident in which a far-left activist tried to firebomb an ICE facility President Trump. Governor Jay Inslee was responding to the attack, during which 69-year-old Willem Van Spronsen, who was armed with a rifle, was shot dead after throwing Molotov cocktails at the building and nearby cars. Van Spronsen was an Antifa activist and reportedly wrote a manifesto explaining the motives behind the attack. However, according to presidential candidate Inslee, President Trump is to blame.57 Homeless People Reject Developers Offer of Free Money To Leave Area58 In a bizarre stunt Friday, an elf-costumed real estate developer threw money at residents of a homeless camp in California in an effort to entice them to leave. Free money! Free money!, Gene Gorelik shouted from a boom lift as he dropped dollar bills on the encampment, SFGate reported. He was also reportedly offering 2,000 to anyone who agreed to leave. But none of the residents, who live in cars, RVs and tents, accepted his offer.59 Internal Dem Poll Just 9 of Swing Voters Have Favorable View of Ilhan Omar60 A newly released internal poll of Democratic swing voters found that just 9 per cent have a favorable view of Rep. Ilhan Omar while just 22 per cent view Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez favorably. The poll included 1,003 likely general-election voters who are white and have two years or less of college education, reports Axios. The results validate the concerns of many Democrats that the party is moving too far left and losing moderate voters in the process.61 Larry C. Johnson The Obama Administration Manufactured the Case Against General Flynn62 The newest piece of information comes courtesy of Sundance at The Conservative Treehouse in his piece, Flynn Case Highlights Multiple Insurance Policy Motives by DOJ and FBI Operatives. Up to this point, I confess, I bought into the story that Michael Flynn was working on behalf of Turkey and failed to register under the Foreign Agent Registration Act. In short, he was guilty of a FARA violation. But thats not the real story. Flynn was set up. What do I mean? There is no evidence that Michael Flynn sought out Government of Turkey representative and asked to go to work for them. That has been the conventional wisdom. But it turns out that Flynn was not working for the Government of Turkey. Flynns firm was hired by INOVO in September 2016. Here is what USA Today reported in March of 2017 As part of its contract with Inovo, the Flynn Intel Group hired researchers to examine Fethullah Gulen, a reclusive Islamic cleric who lives in exile in rural Pennsylvania. Erdogan has blamed Gulens opposition group for an attempted 2016 coup and has sought his extradition. On Election Day, The Hill newspaper published a Flynn op-ed that called Gulen radical cleric and said the U.S. government should not provide him a safe haven. At least three possibilities exist with respect to the motive for producing this report-1 it was initiated by the Government of Turkey using INOVO as a cut out, or 2 INOVO was asked by someone linked to the Clinton Campaign or the US Government to hire Flynns company to do the work, or 3 INOVO did this on its own. Regardless of the motive, what we now know is that the US Government, courtesy of either an FBI FISA or the NSA, was monitoring communications with Michael Flynn. The FBI Director of the National Security Division, David Laufman, led the charge in pressing Flynn to file a belated FARA. That filing was then used as evidence that Flynn lied.63 Meet the Madam Epstein Arrest Casts Spotlight on Clinton-Linked Socialite64 Questions swirl around role of Ghislaine Maxwell in Epsteins trafficking crimes Following the arrest of pedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein last Saturday, many outlets have turned their attention to his longtime confiante, socialite heiress Ghislaine Maxwell  who has been accused by three women of procuring and training young girls to perform massage and sexual acts on the 66-year-old registered sex offender and his associates. Maxwell, 57, comes from money. Her father was publisher Robert Maxwell  who himself faced accusations of being a Mossad double and possibly triple agent and a bad character who was almost certainly financed by Russia, according to the British Foreign Office. Robert Maxwell died in 1991 when he fell from his yacht, the Lady Ghislaine  however the circumstances surrounding his demise have been rife with speculation including that it was a Mossad assassination  a theory which attorney and longtime Epstein associate Alan Dershowitz slammed in a 2003 op-ed. It is unknown exactly how Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell met  however they reportedly dated around 1992, shortly after her fathers death. After breaking up, they remained good friends. In 1995, Epstein renamed a now-defunct Palm Beach company Ghislaine Corp, which was dissolved in 1998 per the Wall Street Journal. In 2003, Epstein described Maxwell as his best friend, who was not on his payroll  yet seems to organize much of his life.65 Pushing Back Against Anti-Americanism66 For decades, Republicans and Christians have passively allowed leftists to infect our youth with anti-Americanism and instill a culture of glorified debauchery while systemically secularizing our government. All references of Americas Christian founding have been removed from public education. Historian David Barton is pushing back by publishing his Founders Bible. Democrats sought to destroy Bernie Marcus, co-founder of Home Depot, for donating to Trumps reelection campaign. Unlike most Republicans, Trump pushed back. He boldly defended Marcus and Home Depot with the following tweet67 Sexual Predators Within Americas Power Elite What Youre Not Being Told68 Politics, religion, sports, government, entertainment, business, armed forces it doesnt matter what arena youre talking about, they are all riddled with the kind of seedy, sleazy, decadent, dodgy, depraved, immoral, corrupt behavior that somehow gets a free pass when it involves the wealthy and powerful elite in America. In this age of partisan politics and a deeply polarized populace, corruption  especially when it involves sexual debauchery, depravity and predatory behavior  has become the great equalizer. Take Jeffrey Epstein, the hedge fund billionaire  convicted serial pedophile recently arrested on charges of molesting, raping and sex trafficking dozens of young girls. It is believed that Epstein operated his own personal sex trafficking ring not only for his personal pleasure but also for the pleasure of his friends and business associates. According to The Washington Post, several of the young women.say they were offered to the rich and famous as sex partners at Epsteins parties. At various times, Epstein ferried his friends about on his private plane, nicknamed the Lolita Express. This is part of Americas seedy underbelly. As I documented in the in-depth piece I wrote earlier this year, child sex trafficking  the buying and selling of women, young girls and boys for sex, some as young as 9 years old  has become big business in America. It is the fastest growing business in organized crime and the second most-lucrative commodity traded illegally after drugs and guns.69 Stunning Video Maps Out All of the 4,000 Exoplanets Discovered by NASA Since the First Distant World Was Spotted in 199270 NASA has released a stunning visualisation of all the exoplanets it has ever spotted, including those from dedicated world-hunting crafts Kepler and TESS. The first exoplanets  a world not in our own solar system but orbiting another star  was spotted in 1992 going round the pulsar PSR 125712. Since then NASA has found more than 4,000  crossing the landmark figure last month. The incredible visualisation of where each exoplanet is in the night sky was made by NASA using data from System Sounds, a science outreach project.71 Terrorist Who Firebombed ICE Facility Wrote in Manifesto I Am Antifa72 The terrorist who firebombed an ICE facility in Washington State yesterday released a manifesto before the attack stating, I am Antifa and said the attack was motivated by his opposition to concentration camps in the U.S. 69-year-old Willem Van Spronsen was shot dead by police after he threw Molotov cocktails at the building and nearby cars on Saturday morning. According to his manifesto, a copy of which was obtained by Jack Posobiec, Van Spronsen was armed with an AR-15 and stated, I am Antifa.73 The Epstein Scandal The Elites Tremble74 by Davide Malacaria Billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein was arrested by Federal prosecutors in New York on charges of sex abuse and trafficking of minors. And the elite trembles. Epstein had already been condemned on similar charges in the past but had got off with a light sentence thanks to a plea deal brokered by former US attorney and current Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta. Acosta is now being highly criticized for the decision and is facing calls to resign. Besides Acosta, Trump is also being accused of entertaining relations with Epstein whom he praised in a declaration some years ago75 Unity4J Twitter Account Aimed at Supporting Julian Assange Suspended Without Explanation76 Unity4J, of the biggest Twitter accounts aimed specifically at supporting WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, has been suspended from Twitter without any explanation. The nonpartisan account had over 10,000 followers and shared news and updates from both left and right wing sources.77 A Question of Trust Ursula Von Der Leyen Recruits Team to Win Over Brussels78 Until recently, Ursula von der Leyen was largely unknown in Brussels. Now the German defense minister needs to win over a majority of the EU Parliament to secure the presidency of the European Commission. She remains an enigma to many, but is hoping some high-profile advisers can help change that. By Markus Becker, Matthias Gebauer and Peter Müller Ursula von der Leyen, who is currently being shielded from journalists like a pop star from groupies, is taking a break in front of the International Press Center in Brussels European Quarter. She repeatedly throws her arms around. Now I need a bit of movement, she says. It is shortly before midnight on Tuesday, and the aspiring president of the European Commission, the European Unions executive, is on her way to her hotel after many hours at her desk and phone. It is cold this late in the evening, and the center-right Christian Democrat CDU politician is wearing only a pink cardigan. But the cold doesnt seem to bother her. Von der Leyen is bursting with energy, and gushes about her new job The young people working for the transition team, the languages, the international surroundings. After her years at the head of the stiff and scandal-plagued German Defense Ministry in Berlin, von der Leyen seems like she has been liberated. In her steep political ascent, she was often protected by people at the very top, but now she has to fight for herself, and conduct a campaign on her own  or almost alone, given the small, occasionally colorful flock of advisers at her side79 Brexit Warning EUs Swiss Bullying is Just Dress Rehearsal for Vulnerable UK  Expert80 THE EUROPEAN Union has shot itself in the foot with its attempts to strong-arm Switzerland into signing up for a wide-ranging agreement covering financial services  but Brussels is likely to try a similar strategy when it comes to Britain as Brexit looms, a senior economist has predicted.81 France Nice Has First Fireworks Show Since 2016 Terror Attack82 The first firework display in Nice since the terrorist attack of July 2016 has taken place in celebration of todays July 14 Fte Nationale. Almost three years to the day since the deadly attacks on July 14 2016, authorities in Nice organised the first official fireworks display to take place in the city since. The display was launched from a boat in front of the Quai des Etats-Unis an extension of the famous Promenade des Anglais. The display took place on July 13, however  not July 14  in response to requests from associations representing the families of the terrorist attack victims.83 Germany Merkel Honors Hitler Assassins, Laments Rise of Far Right84 The chancellor said Germans have a duty to stand up to right-wing extremists just as the resistance faced down Adolf Hitler. July 20 is the 75th anniversary of the failed assassination attempt on the Nazi dictator. German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Saturday urged strong opposition from all sections of German society against the resurgence of right-wing extremism. In her weekly video address, a week before the 75th anniversary of the assassination attempt on Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, she paid tribute to those who opposed the Führers rule, and took action. They followed their conscience and thereby shaped a part of Germanys history that otherwise would have been solely defined by the darkness of National Socialism, Merkel said. 85 New Syphilis Cases Now Outnumber HIV Across Europe86 A new report from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control ECDC has shown a dramatic increase in new cases of syphilis across Europe, outnumbering new cases of HIV. The new ECDC report looked at the cases of syphilis reported across 30 countries between 2007 and 2017 and found the number of new cases had dramatically increased by 70 per cent since 2010 to a record 33,189, Schsische Zeitung reports.87 Polands Population to Shrink by More Than 25 Percent Says EU88 Polands population could drop by over 25 percent over the next 80 years, according to new forecasts released by the EU. The Eurostat data, published on July 10, predicts that the population of the EU as a whole will decline rapidly after peaking at 525 million in 2044, falling to 492.9 million by around 2100. If correct, it means the Polish population has already peaked at 38 million and will steadily decline to 27.5 million in 2100 losing over a quarter of its population.89 Publish Tommy Robinsons Name on Facebook and Youre Out in Sweden90 Since Tommy Robinson was convicted for defying court order, Facebook introduced a ban about Robinson  all sharings of links regarding the dangerous person, would result in closed accounts. In Sweden, it is enough to write his name on the social media platform to become banned for as long as up to 30 days. One who published a Facebook note about Tommy Robinson, was journalist Ingrid Carlqvist, editor for the podcast Ingrid and Maria. Carlqvist wrote that she unfortunately did not believe that Donald Trump would grant asylum for Robinson, due to the close US-UK relations.91 UK Khans London Charges Green Tax on President Trumps Diplomatic Vehicle92 Transport for London TfL has imposed 34.50 in green taxes on a vehicle that was part of President Donald Trumps motorcade during his State Visit to the United Kingdom in June. The three 11.50 charges were levied on a Chrysler Suburban that drove ahead of President Trumps limousine, The Beast, after the vehicle entered the citys Congestion Charge zone, and TfL is currently trying to track down the vehicles owner to extract the charges, the Evening Standard revealed on Friday.93 Authorities Grill Members of Terrorist Cell Busted in Kuwait94 Following the arrest of eight members of a terrorist cell linked to Egypts outlawed Muslim Brotherhood in Kuwait on Friday, security sources yesterday said state security investigations with them focused on three basic elements  the visas on which they entered Kuwait and their relationship with the sponsors who issued them the meetings they had in Kuwait with Kuwaitis or others and whether they were held with good or bad intentions in addition to the nature of work and activities they practiced in Kuwait. According to sources, some of the suspects  all Egyptians  worked for a charity organization in Kuwait. The sources added that investigators want to know whether the cell had planned any operations outside Kuwait while they were here. The sources said after confiscating the groups laptops, mobile phones and documents, state security detectives are currently examining and analyzing them to prepare a complete case file. The sources said the terrorist group had been tracked down after state security received tips from local and foreign sources, including suspects arrested in Egypt, concerning the cell members and the danger they pose due to their military training. A statement by the interior ministry on Friday carried by the state-run news agency KUNA said the militants were allegedly members of a terrorist cell, including some who have been convicted of terrorism and sentenced to jail in Egypt. Those arrested carry Egyptian nationalities and belong to the Muslim Brotherhood organization, the ministry said. The suspects, it said, are wanted by Egypt where some of them have been sentenced to up to 15 years in jail. During interrogations, the suspects admitted to carrying out terrorist operations in Egypt. Investigations are ongoing to determine their accomplices, the statement said, warning that it will crack down ruthlessly against saboteurs. Egyptian authorities have led a crackdown on Muslim Brotherhood members after the military overthrew Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in 2013. Later that year Egypt outlawed the Muslim Brotherhood and declared it a terrorist organization. Egypt and its allies, including Gulf powerhouses Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, consider the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization.95 Bharat Sevashram Sangha Monk and Devotees Attacked in Jammu-Twai Humsafar Express in Lucknow Station by RPF as Provoked by Two Muslim Women, While Returning From Amarnath Yatra96 Hindu Monk and Devotees of Bharat Sevashram Sangha are badly assaulted by RPF in Lucknow under provocation of Muslim Women and their husbands in Govt service. No action taken so far. Upananda Brahmachari  HENB  Haridwar  July 13, 2019 This is very embarrassing that a Bharat Sevashram Sangha Monk and devotees were attacked, assaulted and humiliated in Jammu-Twai Humsafar Express in Lucknow Station by RPF as provoked by two Muslim women, while returning from Amarnath Yatra. But, there is no time for the Union Railway Minister, Union Home Minister and UP Chief Minister, anyway. Bharat Sevashram Sangha is a internationally famed philanthropic organization which is mostly renowned for its relief work in any calamity or disaster with various social welfare activities as run by the organisation. A Hindu monk who is in charge of the Kaliaganj branch of the Bharat Sevashram Sangha in North Dinajpur and nine other devotees returning from the Amarnath yatra, including three women, were allegedly beaten up by a group of Railway Protection Force personnel at Lucknow station on Wednesday past Thursday midnight. Swami Jyotirmoyananda popularly known as Utpal Maharaj and some of the devotees lodged a complaint with the Government Railway Police in Sealdah on Thursday and have also tweeted to Union railway minister Piyush Goyal and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath about the incident. But, any reaction, intervention or appropriate steps yet to be reported unfortunately. We boarded the Sealdah-bound Humsafar Express from Jammu Tawi on Wednesday morning and all of us had reservations in an AC coach. Two Muslim women named Mehnaj Rahaman and E. Rahaman in reserved seat no 26 and 28 in no coach no 13 with another two Muslim women requested us to let them sit in our berths. We agreed, Swami Jyotirmoyananda said. According to the monk, at about 3 pm, they asked the women to sit in their reserved seats, as some elderly persons with the monk extremely needed some rests. Surprisingly, their behaviour changed all on a sudden and they refused to vacate the berths. They also threatened us that we would be taught a lesson when the train reached Lucknow. One of them claimed that her husband was a senior government official in Indian Railway Personnel Services IRPS. We did not get into any further argument and accommodated ourselves in the remaining berths, said Swami Jyotirmoyananda9798 Terrified JB Hi-Fi Workers Detail How Teenage Gangs Are Targeting Their Stores in Swarming Rip and Run Theft Rampages99 Thieves have increasingly swarmed stores across Melbourne taking costly items in a rip and run manner, with iPhones as the hottest commodity.100 Baltimore Mayor Were Not Going to Cooperate in ICE Raids101 Baltimores mayor announced Friday that his city would not be the one to cooperate in a series of targeted immigration enforcement raids taking place on Sunday. Were not going to cooperate, said Democrat Baltimore Mayor Jack Young, who spoke Friday at a protest rally outside City Hall, according to a report from WJZ. Youngs city is one of ten cities in the U.S. that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE targeted for deportation raids that would expel anyone in the U.S. not in the country legally.102 Democratic Governor Blames Trump for Leftist Who Firebombed ICE Facility103 Yes, really The Democratic Governor of Washington State believes there is one person to blame for an incident in which a far-left activist tried to firebomb an ICE facility President Trump. Governor Jay Inslee was responding to the attack, during which 69-year-old Willem Van Spronsen, who was armed with a rifle, was shot dead after throwing Molotov cocktails at the building and nearby cars. Van Spronsen was an Antifa activist and reportedly wrote a manifesto explaining the motives behind the attack. However, according to presidential candidate Inslee, President Trump is to blame. Inslee said Trump was intentionally trying to create anxiety and fear among undocumented families. He also tried to deliberately mislead people about the nature of the attack by claiming it is unknown whether Van Spronsen was targeting detainees or staff, when it was established almost immediately that the incident was an anti-ICE attack. Comment Typical communist  full of lies. More and more it seems Democrats are the party of the Anti-Christ. 104 EU Should Charter Migrant Flights, Says Italian FM105 Italys foreign minister has called for recent problems posed by mass migration to be solved within a European framework. Italy has borne the brunt of a huge influx of migrants to Europe that erupted in 2015. Italys foreign minister on Sunday unveiled a raft of proposals aimed at restructuring the European Unions response to a migrant crisis that has strained relations between Italy and its EU neighbors. Asylum applications should be filed at EU centers located outside the bloc, Enzo Moavero Milanesi told Sundays Corriere della Sera newspaper. Those deemed eligible for asylum would be flown on chartered flights into the bloc, bypassing people traffickers and perilous sea journeys, the minister suggested in the interview. Those who have the right to asylum must be able to travel in dignified conditions, not in the hands of criminals, he said. 106 Final Death Toll in Boat Migrant Accident Off Tunisia Rises to 82107 TUNIS Reuters  The number of bodies recovered by Tunisia after a ship packed with migrants sank off its coast last week has risen to 82, in one of the worst disasters in recent years, the TunisianRed Crescent said on Saturday. The boat capsized after setting off for Europe from neighboring Libya. Survivors told the Tunisian coast guard last week that it had been carrying 86 people. Tunisian fishermen rescued four people but one later died in hospital, the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR said last week.108 Illegal Alien Accused of Killing Illinois Father of Two Locked Up on 1m Bail109 An illegal alien accused of killing father of two, Corey Cottrell, is now being held on a 1 million bail after pleading not guilty following a deadly hit-and-run in the sanctuary state of Illinois. Jose Rodriguez, a 27-year-old illegal alien from Honduras, is accused of running a red light on June 22 in Bloomington, Illinois, causing him to hit and kill 39-year-old Corey Cottrell, a father of two daughters, who was riding his motorcycle at the time and was on his way to see his mother, Kathy. Prosecutors said Rodriguez fled the scene of the crash after hitting Cottrell. The following day, the illegal alien turned himself into law enforcement officials and has since been charged with causing a deadly hit-and-run and driving without a license.110 Kamala Harris Struggles to Defend Her Position to Decriminalize Illegal Border Crossings111 On ABCs The View, Sen. Kamala Harris struggled to defend her position to decriminalize illegal immigration. This is the position she took during the first Democratic debate. She talks out of both sides of her mouth in the interview trying to pander to both sides of the aisle.112 Rep. Ilhan Omar Claims She Probably Loves America More Than Any Natural-Born Americans113 During a panel discussion at the Netroots Nation Conference, Rep. Ilhan Omar defended her past anti-American comments by questioning the patriotism of natural-born Americans It is that I am anti-American because I criticize the United States. I believe, as an immigrant, I probably love this country more than anyone that is naturally born and because I am ashamed of it continuing to live in its hypocrisy. We export American exceptionalism, the great America, the land of liberty and justice. If you ask anybody walking on the side of the street somewhere in the middle of the world they will tell you, America the great, but we dont live those values here. That hypocrisy is one that I am bothered by. I want America the great to be America the great. Of course, there was no question asking what she means by hypocrisy. Omar just spews rhetoric against her adopted country with political grandstanding thats sickening. Comment She is in love with the Amerika in her mind, not the constitutional Republic of the United States.114 Reports ICE Has Begun Raids to Round Up Undocumented Migrants115 Immigration authorities have begun conducting raids, a senior administration official said Sunday, in an operation expected to target about 2,000 undocumented migrants ordered by courts to be removed from the country. The Wall Street Journal also confirmed the development, citing a source. The raids, which will focus on recent arrivals to the country, are slated for Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York and San Francisco, a senior immigration official said. New Orleans is also on the list, but the city tweeted last week that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it would suspend operations through the weekend in areas hit by Tropical Storm Barry.116 Salvini Furious After Paris Gives Medal and Cash to Migrant Ship Captain117 Italian deputy prime minister and minister of the interior Matteo Salvini has expressed anger after the city of Paris granted a medal and 100,000 euros in cash to migrant transport ship captain Carola Rackete and the Sea-Watch NGO. Ms Rackete, who was arrested earlier this month after forcing her ship into Italian territorial waters and ramming a patrol vessel to land migrants on the island of Lampedusa, was honoured by the city of Paris and given honorary citizenship by the citys local government, Il Giornale reports.118 Switzerland Syrian Refugee Breaks Female 7th Grade Teachers Jaw as She Searches Him for Knife119 Youre going to just love the new Europe! A 7th grade refugee student in Germany broke his teachers jaw recently. The boy was searched for a knife when he broke the female teachers jaw.120 Syrian Refugees in Lebanon Forced to Demolish Their Own Homes121 by Randa Ghazy Demolish your home or well do it for you. This, in a nutshell, is the ultimatum that was given to the Syrian refugees living in camps in the village of Arsal, northeast of Beirut. Last week, the Lebanese army demolished at least 20 concrete settlements in three Syrian refugee camps in the village, but before the armys intervention, several refugees had taken the matter in their own hands and had already destroyed their own homes. The demolitions follow a decision by Lebanons Higher Defence Council in April to take down refugee structures made of any material other than plastic and wood. According to the head of the Arsal municipality, Bassel al-Hujeiri, the order applies to 3,500 to 3,600 refugee families in Arsal122 Tucker Carlson Rips Into Ilhan Omars Censor Squad as Insincere Race-Baiters123 Carlson called Rep. Ilhan Omar a living fire alarm of the danger of welcoming immigrants who hate the United States Foxs Tucker Carlson Tonight made some waves at the end of Tuesdays program, when Carlson called Rep. Ilhan Omar a living fire alarm of the danger of welcoming immigrants who hate the United States. It was certainly a hot take, and it underlined once again that the liberal elites  the ones who claim to love democracy and free speech  will not tolerate criticism of Omar Carlson responded in kind on Wednesday CARLSON Needless to say, the Left went berserkIlhan Omar and her allies in Congress immediately demanded that this show be pulled off the air. They didnt rebut what we said, any of our points or even acknowledge them. They just tried to silence us. Thats how they operate. And of course they called us racist. On one level thats amusing given how absurd the charge is. This show more than any other show on television has taken an aggressive position in favor of colorblind equality and against racism, particularly the casual racism of the modern world left. We despise the current habit of judging people on the basis of their skin color. Its wrong. We say that virtually every night. Racist? No. Were against racism, adamantly. Omar consistently puts her own race at the center of the conversation, but to us, its irrelevant. Ayaan Hirsi Ali, for example, would by the standards of identity politics by Omars standards seem to have everything in common with Ilhan Omar. Like Omar she was born in Somalia, moved to Kenya and eventually came to this country. Unlike Omar, Ali loves and cares about the United States. She believes our country is superior to the country she came from and she says that. For saying that, the left despises her. Omars friend Linda Sarsour once tweeted that Ali deserves to be mutilated for her beliefs. So two Somali immigrants, one among the most impressive people in America, the other among the least, its not about race. But of course Omar and her friends already know that. Nothing they say on the subject race is sincere. Its all a hustle designed to get them what they want. Omar has made a career of denouncing anyone and anything in her way as racist. That would include virtually all of her political and personal opponents. It includes even inanimate objects like the proposed border wall, thats racist. So is the United States Congress, so is the entire state of North Dakota, she once tweeted.124 Imagine Thinking Like a Brainwashed Leftist125 Brainwashing by fake news, universities and establishment culture leads to this Infowars reporter Kaitlin Bennett interviews leftists protesting upcoming ICE deportation raids set to begin Sunday, and tries to make sense of their twisted logic that stems from fake news and emotion-driven narratives.

One of the woke writers at The Washington Post found something political to nitpick about Disneys remake of The Lion King.

Canada-based journalist Tracey Linderman filed a fear-mongering report for the U.K.s Guardian newspaper Tuesday, Activists condemn Canadian cinema chain for screening anti-abortion film Cineplex Entertainment criticized for screening Unplanned, which is said to promote falsehoods about reproductive health. Previously, the movies producers said the pro-life film had been effectively banned in Canada due to several prominent Canadian distributors, including Cineplex, refusing to pick up the film because of its pro-life content. Cineplex has evidently changed its mind and will now run the film. Now the left-wing U.K. paper is furious at the cinema chains audacity to actually screen a movie with a premise liberals find to be suffused with wrongthink the few liberals that have actually bothered to watch it, anyway, rather than condemning it sight unseen. Its bizarre to see a journalist denigrating freedom of expression laws, but there it is, in paragraph one134  1  2 362250  3 362213  4 362282  5 362242  6 362276  7 362256  8 362244  9 362254  10 362221  11 362215  12 362233  13 362235  14 362286  15 362252  16 362207  17 362248  18 362208  19 362260  20 362266  21 362210  22 362270  23 362278  24 362258  25 362274  26 362211  27 362202  28 362204  29 362217  30 362225  31 362209  32 362264  33 362272  34 362239  35 362237  36 362262  37 362268  38 362246  39 362206  40 362219  41 362231  42 362280  43 362227  44 362229  45 362223  46  47 topheadline  48  49 topheadline  50  51 topheadline  52  53 topheadline  54  55 topheadline  56  57 topheadline  58  59 topheadline  60  61 topheadline  62  63 topheadline  64  65 topheadline  66  67 topheadline  68  69 topheadline  70  71 topheadline  72  73 topheadline  74  75 topheadline  76  77 topheadline  78  79 topheadline  80  81 topheadline  82  83 topheadline  84  85 topheadline  86  87 topheadline  88  89 topheadline  90  91 topheadline  92  93 topheadline  94  95 topheadline  96  97  98 topheadline  99  100 topheadline  101  102 topheadline  103  104 topheadline  105  106 topheadline  107  108 topheadline  109  110 topheadline  111  112 topheadline  113  114 topheadline  115  116 topheadline  117  118 topheadline  119  120 topheadline  121  122 topheadline  123  124 topheadline  125  126 topheadline  127  128 topheadline  129  130 topheadline  131  132 topheadline  133  134 topheadline",homeless

Brown Jacksons record was a focal point last year during her confirmation for a seat on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, where she now sits. The 51-year-old judge is widely considered one of the favorites to replace Breyer. Judge Jacksons record of reversals by the left-leaning D.C. Circuit is troubling for anyone concerned about the rule of law, Judicial Crisis Network president Carrie Severino told Fox News Digital on Tuesday. For example, in Make the Road New York v. Wolf, a D.C. Circuit panel composed of a majority of Democratic nominees concluded that Jackson had set aside a Trump administration rule where there was no legal basis to do so. Cases like these suggest that Jackson might be willing in politically charged cases to ignore the law to deliver a particular policy outcome, and thats not what we want to see from a Supreme Court justice, she continued. 78 Denver Dropping Mask or Proof of Vaccine Requirement Omicron Has Run Out of Fuel79 Denvers mask or proof of vaccine requirement to enter businesses is set to expire this week as health officials in Colorado say the omicron coronavirus variant has run out of fuel within our community.

The Constitutional Court sent Austrian Health Minister Wolfgang Mückstein some questions about the alleged burden on the health system. The background is an ordinance review procedure regarding the Corona measures taken by the government in Vienna. The catalog of questions can only be described as explosive due to the political narrative that has been cultivated in the Alpine republic. The court wanted to know if the figures for deaths and hospitalizations during the pandemic cover all infected people. The question points to the typical manipulation of the data confounding the dead and hospitalized with Covid or from Covid that has also been used in Austria. If so, why was this counting method chosen? the judges demanded. In addition, the court wanted a breakdown of Covid deaths and hospitalizations, specified by age. Was Covid the cause of the hospitalizations? Had they unnecessarily hospitalized healthy people, due to a positive test exclusively? Another set of questions was devoted to the effectiveness of wearing the so-called protective masks. Against the background of the spreading Omicron variant, Austria tightened restrictions at the beginning of January. These now also provide for wearing an FFP2 mask outdoors if the minimum distance, which has long been mandatory, cannot be maintained. 152 Cyprus Toddler Refused Heart Surgery in Three Separate Countries Over Parents Being Unjabbed153 A Cypriot toddler has been refused necessary heart surgery in three separate countries over the fact his parents were not vaccinated.

Born in The Hague in 1983 to Moroccan immigrants her father was the founder of a mosque in that city, she joined a jihadist terror organization, the Hofstad group, at a young age, and along with another member of the group, Noureddine el Fahtni, to whom shed been married in an Islamic ceremony, acquired an Agram 2000 submachine gun, which they were reportedly planning to use, at the direction of the leaders of the Hofstad group, to kill various politicians. Among their intended victims were Geert Wilders, then a relatively new member of the Dutch lower house, the Tweede Kamer, whod made a name for himself as a critic of the Islamization of the Netherlands, and the Somali-born Ayaan Hirsi Ali, whod rejected her Muslim faith after 911 and been elected to the Tweede Kamer in 2002. The year was 2005. The previous few years had been a busy time for assassination and assassination plots. On May 6, 2002, nine days before a general election from which he was expected to emerge as prime minister of the Netherlands, Pim Fortuyn had been murdered by an activist named Volkert van der Graaf who was appalled by his criticisms of Islam. In the summer of 2004, Sahlas husband, Fahtni, had been arrested in Portugal on suspicion of planning to kill that countrys then prime minister, Jos Manuel Duro Barroso, but there had not been sufficient evidence to hold him. A few months later, on the morning of November 2, 2004, a fellow member of the Hofstad group, Mohammed Bouyeri, had slaughtered the celebrated writer and filmmaker Theo van Gogh  perhaps the Netherlands most prominent critic of Islam  on a busy street in Amsterdam. Sahla and Fahtnis plans, however, did not prove as successful as Bouyeris. On June 22, 2005, they were both arrested by Amsterdam police. Fahtni ended up serving six months. Sahla spent nine years in and out of court. First, she was convicted by a Rotterdam court of illegally possessing weapons and of membership in a terrorist organization with the intent to commit murder. Later, the Court of Appeal in The Hague found her guilty, in addition, of planning to murder Wilders and others. In 2011, however, the Supreme Court annulled that ruling and transferred the case to the Amsterdam Court of Appeal, which in 2014 found Sahla guilty of membership in a terrorist organization and possession of firearms but not of intention to kill anybody. Although sentenced to three years, she didnt have to spend any time in prison because of the time shed already served in detention. During that long trial period, Sahla had studied political science, African Studies, and Islamic theology. Shed also, curiously enough, become the protege of Frits Bolkestein, a legendary figure in the center-right VVD Peoples Party for Freedom and Democracy. As the newspaper Het Parool put it the other day, Bolkestein led her into the party in 2011  that is, while her case was still under adjudication  unseen and without causing a fuss. Its been established that Bolkestein knew about her history. So did other VVD leaders. Not one of them, apparently, considered it a reason not to give her a responsible party position. Sahla began her career in the VVD as head of its deradicalization and terror group as of the beginning of this year, shed risen in the party ranks to become  simultaneously  head of the VVDs security and justice division, chair of a party advisory committee on deradicalization and terror, and right-hand woman to Bolkestein. Its worth noting that the current head of the VVD, Mark Rutte, is also prime minister of the Netherlands, a position he has held since 2010 168 Ireland 30,000 in Fines Paid for Breaches of COVID Regulations in Kerry169 Over 30,000 in fines has been paid for breaches of COVID-19 regulations in Kerry.

Britains fishing industry was infamously sacrificed by Prime Minister Edward Ted Heath during negotiations to join the European Economic Community EEC, as the EU then was, in the 1970s, with the Tory leader agreeing that European fishing stocks would be shared out by Brussels as a so-called common resource after Britains entry. 178 Russian Orthodox Archbishop Blames U.S. For Stoking Fears of Ukraine War179 Russian Metropolitan Archbishop Hilarion Alfeyev warned this weekend that the United States is unnecessarily stoking fears of a war between Russia and Ukraine.

In this, the American businessman, who magnanimously calls himself a political philanthropist, points his finger firmly at China as the number one enemy. It is worth pausing at some of Soros remarks in order to understand the thinking of one of the most influential players in U.S. and European politics. His self-description as a political philanthropist is a staggering contradiction in words that in a way characterizes his entire analysis of our current historical landscape. Pairing the concept of philanthropy, that is best described as selfless giving stemming from empathy and humanistic values with politics is a hypocrisy that is at the core of Soros quest for global influence, and one that runs through his entire Hoover Institution address. 182 Scientists Speak Out on Being Silenced When Raising Concerns About COVID Lab Leak Theory183 Some scientists have begun speaking out about efforts to silence researchers who raised concerns about the possibility that COVID-19 could have originated in a Chinese lab.

Petrovsky was not alone, according to reporting from Fox News Benjamin Hall, who spoke with scientists from Israel, the U.S., Australia, Germany, the U.K., Australia and Germany. The scientists told Fox News that they received backlash and resistance to getting their work published, even from those who quietly believed in the possibility of the lab-leak theory. 184 Unvaxxed Parents in Western Australia Banned From Visiting Sick Children in Hospital185 Unvaccinated parents in Western Australia will not be able to visit their own sick children in hospital, with news anchors discussing the rule celebrating it as an excellent way of forcing the unvaxxed to change their philosophy. From yesterday onwards, parents who havent received at least two doses of the vaccine will be barred from visiting their own kids, unless on compassionate end of life grounds. In other words, their child has to literally be on its deathbed for unvaxxed parents to be allowed into hospitals in Western Australia. 186 Watch Convoy to Canberra Reject Violence187 Thousands gathered at Parliament House as part of a convoy from all over the country.
