baltimore,2021-08-31T00:00:00Z,States News Service,The Baltimore Sun,affordable housing,LETTER TO [ORGANIZATION] AND [ORGANIZATION],"Because rents in public housing are capped at 30 percent of a households income, public housing is a critical source of affordable housing for low-income families. In [ORGANIZATION], for example, public housing comprises over half of the homes which are affordable to extremely low-income tenants, or those making less than 30 percent of the area median.1 [ORGANIZATION] has been conducting research on public housing for a forthcoming report, and many residents we interviewed testified to the crucial role public housing has played in their own lives.

She has sent videos of vehicles illegally dumping in the area, but the city has not taken action. I gave her my cell number and promised to post any videos she sends me all over social media so we can combat this illegal trash dumping. I also encouraged her to knock on every one of her neighbors doors to tell the city how they feel. In addition to the grandmother, I promised [ORGANIZATION] that we would return.

Vaccines by [ORGANIZATION] and [LOCATION] are expected to receive approval [LOCATION]6 and next.

With a search warrant in hand and guns drawn, police raided [PERSON]6 [PERSON]1 home on [ORGANIZATION] [TIME], seizing her computers and cellphone. [PERSON]. Rep. [PERSON]7 criticized the appearance of the raid. Unless we get more information showing otherwise, it looks like an act of retaliation or an attempt to silence Ms. [PERSON]6 for her critiques of the states COV[PERSON]D-19 response, [PERSON]7 said in a Tues[ORGANIZATION] statement. [PERSON]6 has not been charged and denies sending the message, saying she doesnt have the technical skills to be a hacker. COV[PERSON]D-19 data whistleblower could face [ORGANIZATION]6 in prison if charged with cybercrime9 via [PERSON]8 and [PERSON]9 of the South [ORGANIZATION] Sun-Sentinel The state law used to justify a police raid at the home of a COV[PERSON]D-19 whistleblower suspected of accessing a [ORGANIZATION] emergency messaging system without permission carries a stiff penalty [ORGANIZATION]7 in prison. That means [PERSON]6, the ORG35 data scientist fired in [ORGANIZATION]8 for alleged insubordination, may be in significant legal peril if prosecutors press third-degree felony charges. PERSON50, an attorney with ORG36 who specializes in cybersecurity and data privacy law, said that [PERSON]6 could face a much longer penalty [ORGANIZATION]9 if prosecutors proved she somehow disrupted the states systems or committed other aggravating offenses. But some legal experts think the state would be hard-pressed going after her in the courts. Hundreds of [ORGANIZATION] renters evicted during pandemic despite [LOCATION] order10 [PERSON] and PERSON[LOCATION]02 of [ORGANIZATION] The nationwide moratorium ordered by the [LOCATION] was supposed to protect renters who have lost work from the pandemic.

So far, there have been 170 cases of COV[PERSON]D-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, in people who were not previously infected. Only eight of those cases were among people who received two shots of the [PERSON], a strong signal of efficacy.

That means the [PERSON]. government may not be able to ramp up as rapidly as it had expected from the 100 million doses of the [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] that it purchased DATE57, raising questions about whether it can keep to its aggressive schedule to vaccinate most [ORGANIZATION]2s by DATE58 or DATE59.

Those hints of an uptick in case counts come as the country faces an already substantial wave of infections that began in [LOCATION] and spread to every corner of the map as [ORGANIZATION]4 turned to fall and the weather cooled.

Mass deployment of some sort of [PERSON] early on in [ORGANIZATION]7 or throughout [ORGANIZATION]7 of [LOCATION] could fuel a pretty sharp recovery not only in [PERSON]. economic activity, but also global economic activity due to pent-up demand, she said. The million-dollar question is how [PERSON]. policy toward [PERSON]0 might change when President-elect [PERSON]04 takes office, but [PERSON]03 didnt expect a huge overhaul.

Direct checks are an excellent [STREET] to get money into the hands of people who desperately need it, Sen. [PERSON]07 said. President-elect [PERSON]04 has said that any aid [ORGANIZATION] passes [ORGANIZATION]9 will just be a down payment on additional help he hopes to pass in [LOCATION], which could include another round of direct checks.

But over [LOCATION]1, at least 19 COV[PERSON]D-19 cases in GPE[DATE] have been linked to migrant workers who slipped between the two countries undetected. The infections have spooked Thai officials, who have managed one of the worlds most successful coronavirus containment strategies.

According to [ORGANIZATION], the state may use celebrities, faith leaders, and community messengers to encourage vaccinations. The state will use different approaches based on demographics. Meanwhile, in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]9 plans mostly nothing. Compared to other Republican [PERSON], [PERSON]9 remains a dangerous and frustrating outlier on the virus. He opposes restrictions on businesses, but widespread vaccinations will make more people comfortable with going to restaurants, movie theaters and theme parks. [PERSON]9 also faces major challenges with the rollout. Not only is [ORGANIZATION] the third-largest state, vaccination compliance already is low. How wary should [ORGANIZATION] be of COV[PERSON]D-related lawsuit immunity?61 via [ORGANIZATION] editorial board Businesses cannot be expected to be instant experts on how to handle a new pandemic. COV[PERSON]D-19 was unfamiliar, and the protocols for containing the spread changed. Businesses that act in good faith should not be held to an unreasonable standard of conduct. No one wants a rash of frivolous lawsuits from diners suing restaurants that acted responsibly and followed state rules. Nothing is risk-free and each of us needs to take personal responsibility for our actions, which includes choosing to eat out during a pandemic. But businesses should not get a free pass. Some will put profits before people, defying even basic protocols and common sense. The courts should be left to resolve those cases. [ORGANIZATION] candidates increasingly skip debates, forums.

ORG30 budget would roll back virtual school choice[LOCATION]12 via PERSON35 of [PERSON]0 Politics  A budget bill in the ORG30 has the potential to end many virtual school options and funnel students into [PERSON]0 Virtual School. Current law requires school districts to offer at least three virtual school options to students within their district, though the statute also allows out-of-district students to enroll with no limit on the number of out-of-district students who could enroll. Essentially, the law allows a county school district to set up a statewide virtual school. Only a handful of school districts have done so, and most of them are large districts, such as [PERSON]3 and [PERSON]4. But a couple of small school districts have entered the field.

The GPE[LOCATION]12 voting laws have been rife up critics, starting with Democrats and voting rights groups and, most recently, large corporations who have waded into the matter. The similarities raise questions about whether [PERSON]0s proposals could hurt the states economy, as has been seen as a potential unintended consequence in GPE[LOCATION]12.

The [ORGANIZATION]5 Rules Committee is slated [PERSON] to take up the proposal [PERSON]3, which has drawn fierce opposition from unions. But a proposed amendment filed by [PERSON], an [PERSON]8 Republican, would exempt unions representing law enforcement officers and firefighters from the requirements. If the amendment is approved [PERSON], the bill will continue to apply to unions, such as the [PERSON]0 Education Association teachers union, that have long been major supporters of Democratic political candidates.

Its something he says half-jokingly, but also half-seriously. I crawl into a bathtub in the fetal position and wait for the ORG21 to end and come out and see the aftermath of whats the collateral damage that they have done, he told ORG51. His frustration with the ORG21 is because DATE[LOCATION]51, he said, [PERSON] chips away at the rights of local government.

In DATE99, PERSON[LOCATION]12 turned over much of that operation to [ORGANIZATION]48. The [ORGANIZATION]47 segment analyzed that decision, implying the Governor was involved in a pay-to-play scheme following a [ORGANIZATION]48 donation. Multiple officials have pushed back against that framing. PERSON150 is standing by her concerns raised at the time, but emphasized DATE30 that her problem with the plan related to issues surrounding rural access to the vaccines, not a purported pay-to-play arrangement. 82[LOCATION]12Callous, cruel and compassionless PERSON151 blasts PERSON[LOCATION]12 for pay for play [ORGANIZATION]48 partnership[LOCATION]2[LOCATION]0 via PERSON133 of [PERSON]0 Politics  [ORGANIZATION] Rep.

During a news conference [LOCATION]10, Dr. PERSON[LOCATION]128, a physician who serves as executive vice president for [ORGANIZATION]54, declined to respond to PERSON[LOCATION]12 action other than to say he believes the universitys move is the best for students and employees.

GPE48 officials still recommend that citizens use masks in indoor spaces where social distancing isnt possible, but the county will no longer require them. Face coverings are still required on all GPE36 [ORGANIZATION]59 buses per [ORGANIZATION]60 requirements. Additionally, the lifting of the order does not apply to entities outside the GPE36 [ORGANIZATION]61 control, including schools and courthouses.

But he noted the South African variants arrival in the county as another potential complication for returning to normal soon.

The number of people in hospitals with [ORGANIZATION] has been stubbornly stagnant since mid-[ORGANIZATION]8. And even as highly contagious virus variants spread, state leaders are relaxing safety precautions. By now, this is a familiar script. But this time around, the countrys leading epidemiologists disagree about what to call this latest phase of the pandemic. Is [PERSON]2 on the cusp of a fourth wave?

The drug sells for [LOCATION]0,120 for a [LOCATION]29 course of treatment for [ORGANIZATION]. It brought in 2.8 billion in revenue for [ORGANIZATION]68 [ORGANIZATION]1, and the company expects to make a similar amount in DATEORG202.

Dr. [PERSON]5, could you speak to that  the idea that there might be mental health and suicide related to this? the reporter asked. Instead of deferring to [PERSON]5, [PERSON]4 handled the question himself.

I doubt that the federal government will be the main mover of a vaccine passport concept, said [PERSON]5. They may be involved in making sure things are done fairly and equitably, but I doubt if the federal government is going to be the leading element of that. Passports showing proof of vaccination could speed up international travel re-openings, but the idea of requiring immunization credentials has become a point of contention, particularly among Republican officials.

People are supposed to get two doses three [LOCATION]25 apart. [ORGANIZATION]80, however, separated them by four [LOCATION]25 because that made it faster and simpler for the company to schedule appointments.

As the election neared, the [PERSON]4 team made that disclaimer increasingly opaque. It introduced a second prechecked box, known internally as a money bomb, that doubled a persons contribution. Eventually, its solicitations featured lines of text in bold and capital letters that overwhelmed the opt-out language. The tactic ensnared scores of unsuspecting [PERSON]4 loyalists.

[PERSON]4 tore up or destroyed documents while at his [ORGANIZATION] club. [PERSON]4 also took measures to restrict records of his historic, private discussions with world leaders. I think the risk that he would use that kind of institution to perpetuate lies and untruths is so harmful to our democracy, said [ORGANIZATION]32, who litigated Freedom of Information Act and presidential records laws. Conservatives try to commandeer The Big Lie8[LOCATION]0 via [ORGANIZATION]33 of [ORGANIZATION]65  In the [LOCATION]25 after the DATE47 election, we were all trying to explain how [PERSON]4 had, somehow, narrowly won the presidency. And one phrase that had cropped up just before the election was suddenly on the lips of many analysts fake news. Deliberate election disinformation from dubious websites had infected social media platforms. Some studies even suggested it might have swung the election. Given that last narrative, [PERSON]4 and his supporters quickly sprung into action. They commandeered the term, twisting it to refer to something else entirely. Suddenly, it was used to describe media reports and media figures with who they disagreed. Ex-[PERSON]4 spokeswoman [ORGANIZATION]34 selling GPE23 house8[LOCATION]2 via [ORGANIZATION]35 of the [LOCATION] Times  [ORGANIZATION]36, the former [LOCATION] press secretary, listed the house she owns with husband and ex-[LOCATION] Rays reliever [ORGANIZATION]37 on the market DATE30. The asking price for the [LOCATION]0 home is 1.1 million. The GPE23 couple purchased the home in [LOCATION]54 for 650,000, property appraiser records show. Since then, theyve undertaken significant renovations, said [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]38, who works for Smith amp[LOCATION]08 Associates Real Estate. They did such a great job making this house their own in their renovations since they purchased it, she said, including changes to the floor plan.  [ORGANIZATION]39  Whats a more [ORGANIZATION]40 [STREET] to respond to scandal than to double down? Facing growing accusations he may have traded cash or gifts for sex with a 17-[LOCATION]41-old girl, the [PERSON] Republican vowed not to [ORGANIZATION] his seat in ORG209 and continued to deny allegations. In an op-ed published by the conservative [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]41 wrote, the swamp is out to drown me. But he vowed not to give up the fight. To this point, there are exactly zero credible or even noncredible accusers willing to come forward by name and state on the public record that I behaved improperly toward them, in the manner by which Democratic Gov. [ORGANIZATION]42 10 accusers. [ORGANIZATION]41 is doubling down, to the surprise of no one. Image via ORG211.Yet sources in ORG212 have confirmed to multiple outlets that investigators are looking whether he committed sex trafficking. That stems from an investigation of former [PERSON]7 [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]41 ally [ORGANIZATION]43, who faces a similar charge among many others. [LOCATION]47 in [ORGANIZATION], a report said [ORGANIZATION]41 and [ORGANIZATION]44 had sex with the same underage girl, who also reportedly had sex with a third still-unnamed person involved in [PERSON]0 ORG38 politics. ORG213 quoted a source close to the investigation that said [ORGANIZATION]44 was singing to the feds and that the girl in question testified in front of a grand jury already about sleeping with the Republican ORG209man. Meanwhile, politicos in the [PERSON] wont wait for a resignation to prep for a special election. Theres already speculation such figures as state Rep. [ORGANIZATION]8, former state Rep. [ORGANIZATION]45 or [ORGANIZATION]41 adversary [ORGANIZATION]46 will mound ORG38 bids in a hypothetical race to replace [ORGANIZATION]41. [PERSON]0s [PERSON]4 country stands with [ORGANIZATION]4188 via [ORGANIZATION]48 of [ORGANIZATION]94  Most well-known Republicans are doing their best to avoid [ORGANIZATION]41, but not conservatives in his ruby-red district in [PERSON]0s [PERSON]. I believe this is nothing more than fake news, said [ORGANIZATION]49, a [PERSON]9 activist who is part of a group trying to get a local bridge renamed after [PERSON]4. [ORGANIZATION]50, the [ORGANIZATION]0 ORG214 chair, said he would never condone anyone having sex with someone underage. But he added that so far, I havent heard anything concrete. [ORGANIZATION]41s accused extorter confirms, denies 25 million shakedown89 via [ORGANIZATION]52 and [ORGANIZATION]53 of ORG215  [ORGANIZATION]54, the man Rep. [ORGANIZATION]41 has accused of trying to extort millions from his family admitted in a bizarre interview DATE30 to asking the [PERSON]0 Republicans dad to finance an international plot to rescue an [ORGANIZATION]n citizen widely believed to be dead in [ORGANIZATION]1. [ORGANIZATION]55 said he was aware at the time that [ORGANIZATION]41 might have legal issues and that he suggested that assisting in the mission would create good will toward the congressman. [ORGANIZATION]55 maintained he had not sought to extort the [ORGANIZATION]41 clan. Former lawmaker says [ORGANIZATION]41 fought revenge porn law He thought that any picture was his to use as he [PERSON] via [ORGANIZATION]56 of ORG40  While serving in the [PERSON]0 ORG21, [ORGANIZATION] Rep. [ORGANIZATION]41 opposed a bill meant to stop people from sharing sexually explicit images of their ex-lovers because [ORGANIZATION]41 believed that recipients of those images had a right to share them, according to the sponsor of the legislation. Former state Rep. [ORGANIZATION]57, a Republican from [ORGANIZATION]2, spent three [PERSON] sponsoring legislation to outlaw nonconsensual pornography, sometimes called revenge porn. [ORGANIZATION]58 said DATE30 that [ORGANIZATION]41 was the chief opponent to that legislation. Former Rep. [ORGANIZATION]59 says [ORGANIZATION]41 should resign if there is even a fraction of truth to allegations91 via [ORGANIZATION]60 of [ORGANIZATION]94  In [LOCATION]57, [ORGANIZATION]41 has faced reports that ORG216 is looking into him over an alleged sexual relationship with a 17-[LOCATION]41-old girl and potential violations of sex trafficking laws, as part of a broader investigation. [ORGANIZATION]41 has also reportedly shown off naked photos and videos of women in his life to other ORG209 members and was reminded by former ORG30 Speaker [ORGANIZATION]61 office about the need for professional behavior. If there is even a fraction of truth to these reports, he should resign immediately, [ORGANIZATION]62 wrote in [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]41 has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and been vocal in his own defense. [ORGANIZATION]41s national fan base awaits probe developments92 via PERSON178 of [PERSON]0 Politics This should not happen more than once9[LOCATION]0 via [ORGANIZATION]63 of [ORGANIZATION]65  There are several details of the [ORGANIZATION]41 story that keep sticking in my head, but the one that sticks in it most is the report that he used to wander around and show his colleagues nude photos of people he had slept with. To me, this is something you do, ideally, zero times. You never experience the impulse to do it. But we can probably suppose that this is not what happened. The moments when people make up their secret minds about what is normal and what is acceptable are never big. They are always in private, when no one can see that you have failed the test, when all you were doing was trying to avoid any discomfort, be cool, play along. But there is a price.  [ORGANIZATION]  Half of Republicans believe false accounts of deadly [ORGANIZATION] FAC17 riot9[LOCATION]2 via [ORGANIZATION]64 and [ORGANIZATION]65 of ORG211  Since the deadly [LOCATION]52 insurrection at the [ORGANIZATION] FAC17, [PERSON]4 and his Republican allies have pushed false and misleading accounts to downplay the event that left five dead and scores of others wounded. His supporters appear to have listened. About half of Republicans believe the siege was largely a nonviolent protest or was the handiwork of left-wing activists trying to make [PERSON]4 look bad, a new [ORGANIZATION] poll has found. Six in 10 Republicans also believe the false claim put out by [PERSON]4 that [LOCATION]58 presidential election was stolen from him due to widespread voter fraud, and the same proportion of Republicans think he should run again in 202[LOCATION]2, the [ORGANIZATION]8 [LOCATION]00-[LOCATION]01 poll showed. of Republicans believe FAC16 protest was mostly peaceful. Image via AP.Ex-officer texted We stormed FAC16 during [LOCATION]52 riot, feds say, and tipsters turned him in95 via [ORGANIZATION]66 of [ORGANIZATION]65  A former [ORGANIZATION]3 police officer was arrested [LOCATION]10 for allegedly taking part in the mob that breached the [ORGANIZATION] FAC17 on [LOCATION]52, joining a growing list of current and former law enforcement officers charged in the riot. Federal authorities said [ORGANIZATION]67 entered the building with hundreds of other pro-[PERSON]4 rioters and posed for a picture in FAC16 [PERSON], then bragged about his actions in text messages with friends and family. [ORGANIZATION]69, who served on the police force for nearly two [ORGANIZATION]8 before retiring in [LOCATION]54, is charged with knowingly entering or remaining in a restricted building, disorderly conduct, and parading, demonstrating or picketing in a FAC17 building. Does the ORG219 have the right culture to fight domestic terrorism?96 via [ORGANIZATION]70 for [ORGANIZATION]65  After the [LOCATION]52 riots, ORG219 director [ORGANIZATION]71 proclaimed that a situational information report produced in the ORG219s [ORGANIZATION]4 field office warning of possible violence was transmitted to FAC16 Police on [LOCATION]62, [DATE] before the riot. The ORG219 also posted it to a law enforcement Web portal and briefed it to partners. Though the ORG219 suggests this is good and timely intelligence sharing, I disagree. If smoke were coming from a neighbors house, I would bang on their front door and call 911. They would be properly dismayed if I emailed them a situational information report and posted my concerns on a neighborhood blog. I would have failed them, their house reduced to cinders.

baltimore,2020-10-01T00:00:00Z,The American Prospect Blogs,The Baltimore Sun,homeless,Why Hedge Funds Shouldn't Own the News,"Since these two shadowy financial players increasingly converge, I will refer to all this as hedge fund activity.Dramatic changes in news ownership have been recent and swift. DATE0, hedge funds control one-third of [ORGANIZATION], and all four of the largest local newspaper chains are owned or managed by these poorly regulated financial institutions. Three-quarters of the top 200 newspapers by circulation are owned or controlled by hedge funds.The [ORGANIZATION] dire assessment spotlights the extreme lack of transparency already demonstrated by these companies, and in the context of local news, it has disastrous implications for democracy.The [ORGANIZATION] law enforcement sensitive bulletin on private equity was leaked and published online by a transparency group called [ORGANIZATION], after hackers broke into law enforcement records at a [ORGANIZATION] web development company. The contents of the leak were verified4 by intelligence site ORG2, and the [ORGANIZATION] was reported by ORG3.Noting its assessment was made with high confidence, the [ORGANIZATION] report says that in the long term, criminally complicit investment fund managers likely will expand their money laundering operations as private placement opportunities increase, resulting in continued infiltration of the licit global financial system.The report continuesSpecifically, hedge funds and private equity firms receive funds from entities registered in nations that maintain laws conducive to masking underlying beneficial owners, thereby making it harder for GPE2 financial institutions and regulators to determine the source of funding. Additionally, hedge funds and private equity firms have been used to facilitate transactions in support of fraud, transnational organized crime, and sanctions evasion.The problem is that some of the basic safeguards used to detect money laundering just arent applied to private equity and hedge funds. Of the limited information available about hedge funds, most is general or not publicly reported, the report says, noting that the required [ORGANIZATION], for example, is not public.Furthermore, since many hedge funds and private equity firms are unregistered entities, the [ORGANIZATION] has limited oversight ability, making proactive identification of fraudulent hedge funds difficult, the assessment says. Common anti-money laundering measures that banks and traditional funds operate undersuch as know your customer due diligence programs or providing detailed trading data and company records to the [ORGANIZATION]do not apply to private equity and hedge funds.

DATE0, the largest [ORGANIZATION] newspaper [ORGANIZATION], ORG6, ORG7, and [ORGANIZATION] owned, controlled by, or indebted to hedge funds.Taken together, these chains are [LOCATION] primary source of local news. Under hedge fund stewardship, local newspapers are bleeding staff and resources, even shutting papers down. Much of this shrinkage has been intentionally accelerated by the hedge fund practice of cutting costs to the bone to maximize short-term returnsdemocracy be damned.Its true that newspapers have struggled for [ORGANIZATION] to reinvent themselves in the face of readers turning to social media and online aggregators for information, and losing advertising revenue to the likes of [ORGANIZATION]. But were it not for hedge fund owners bleeding them dry, newspapers could be breaking even or turning modest profits.The [ORGANIZATION] pandemic has accelerated their need to go digital, as print advertising income drops even more. In response to [ORGANIZATION] urgent demand for reliable, fact-checked information, many newspapers are looking to online subscriptions as a growing source of revenue.Most local news outlets are aggressively moving onto digital platforms. But hedge funds, with their emphasis on quick profits and extracting rather than investing cash, are now making that shift nearly impossible.Chains like [ORGANIZATION]0 simply arent investing to expand their online presence, because [ORGANIZATION]1 has made clear it considers it a waste of money. When it unsuccessfully tried to buy ORG7, [ORGANIZATION]1 was highly critical7 of the chains emphasis on digital, arguing the investment cut into shareholders returns.DATE0, hedge funds control one-third of [ORGANIZATION] newspapers, and all four of the largest local newspaper chains are owned or managed by these poorly regulated financial institutions. None of this is to suggest the hedge funds gobbling up troubled newspapers are also laundering cartel money.But their extreme lack of transparency and disinterest in sustainability should be concerning. And we dont know who invests in those particular funds registered in foreign tax havens.One of the things that private equity firms do is to try and hoover up as much money from overseas as possible through tax havens, through things like blocker corporations in [PERSON], which are kind of conduits for money coming from other countries, said [ORGANIZATION], author of [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON].What these blocker corporations do is strip out information, so any kind of financial information becomes secret, so you dont know who the co-investors are, who the people are delivering the other peoples money, [PERSON] told me. Among the most secretive firms is the one I report on most, [ORGANIZATION]1 [ORGANIZATION].Besides [ORGANIZATION]3, [ORGANIZATION]1 owns a third of [ORGANIZATION]4, publisher of [ORGANIZATION]5, GPE4 Daily News, [ORGANIZATION]6, and [ORGANIZATION]7, among others, and has three seats on its board. [ORGANIZATION]3 publishes hometown papers in [LOCATION], GPE6, GPE7, GPE8, GPE9, [ORGANIZATION]0, and scores of smaller communities around the country. [ORGANIZATION]8 publishes papers in [ORGANIZATION]1, [ORGANIZATION]2, [ORGANIZATION]3, and [ORGANIZATION]4, among other locales. [ORGANIZATION]1 also owns 7 percent of [ORGANIZATION]9 fifth-largest chainand 4 percent of ORG7, the largest chain. Your donation keeps this site free and open for all to read. Give what you can...SUPPORT THE PROSPECT8In DATE4, [ORGANIZATION]1 reported that nearly two-thirds 64 percent of its assets under management were beneficially owned by non-[ORGANIZATION] persons.So why does all this matter when it comes to local news? Secrecy We Americans dont like it when mysterious, unknown entities are in charge of a communitys primary source of information. Were used to knowing who owns the TV news network or newspaper in our townseven if only to complain about them. We want to know who they are, so we can judge whether their interests or biases align with our own.We certainly dont expect those owners to hide behind shell companies incorporated in tax-secrecy havens like [PERSON]. Want to speak your mind to one of the four [ORGANIZATION]5 funds [ORGANIZATION]1 uses to control [ORGANIZATION]3? Good luck trying to identify their leadership, let alone their investors.Firms like the privately held [ORGANIZATION]1 have long been highly secretive. As [PERSON] told me, [ORGANIZATION]1 is about the most opaque firm Ive ever seen.The GPE4-based company incorporates its funds in the [ORGANIZATION]6 and [ORGANIZATION]7, locations well known as top corporate-secrecy havens. [ORGANIZATION]1 acknowledgesin its Form [ORGANIZATION], the only publicly released [PERSON] report about its activities filed with [ORGANIZATION] 64 percent of its assets are beneficially owned by non [ORGANIZATION] persons.But what does that mean? In the financial world, persons can refer to [ORGANIZATION]1s shell companies in the [ORGANIZATION]6, as [ORGANIZATION]1s president [PERSON] when asked about it by Sens. PERSON3 and PERSON4 of [ORGANIZATION]8. Or it can mean actual, flesh-and-blood people. We just dont know, because PERSON5 is not required to tell us, noting that [ORGANIZATION]1 has customary contractual confidentiality arrangements with its investors limiting its ability to disclose their identities or background information.ORG22, the hedge fund that put forth the winning bid to buy the ORG6 newspaper chain in a bankruptcy auction [PERSON], also operates [ORGANIZATION]9-based funds10. Of the three ORG23 funds used to purchase ORG6 out of bankruptcy, one was based in [PERSON]. The guarantor of the transaction is based in [PERSON].ORG24 loaned [ORGANIZATION] to finance the ORG7-GateHouse merger in [ORGANIZATION]. Yet that debt is held by 34 separate entities, half of which are incorporated outside GPE20, and that half is responsible for 55 percent of the debt.ORG26 manages and advises13 ORG7, as it did to ORG27, extracting funds from both entities. ORG28 is owned by the GPE21-based ORG29.The ORG30 bulletin stresses that investigators are concerned about funds that consist primarily of shell companies registered in high-risk offshore countries maintaining an unverifiable client base.Thats a perfect description of the firms now controlling much of our local news. Coverage suffers As ORG31 researcher [PERSON] puts it, The loss of journalists always results in a loss of journalism, as editors have to make hard decisions about which stories to cover and which to ignore.When I first worked at the [ORGANIZATION]1-owned [PERSON], we covered a geographically vast county. The paper has since dropped the word county from its masthead, because coverage of GPE23, the county seat, is now nearly nonexistent. So is in-depth coverage of most of the areas other cities, because the staff of four or five reporters cant physically be everywhere at once. Journalists also face a [TIME] deadline because the papers press was sold and the [ORGANIZATION] is now printed a [TIME] [STREET] away.Elected officials know they can get away with more when reporters no longer cover their meetings. Research suggests that towns without newspapers pay higher rates for credit and bonds Following a newspaper closure, municipal borrowing costs increase by 5 to 11 basis points, costing the municipality an additional 650 thousand per issue, one report15 says, while other researchers found16 lower voter turnout in these communities. Private equity shows no interest in sustainability Private equity companies, as the ORG30 notes, frequently acquire a controlling interest of a financially distressed business with the prospect of returning it to profitability under new management or profiting from the sale of its underlying assets emphasis added.While ORG23 purports to be interested in the first scenario, [ORGANIZATION]1 is a case study in the latter. In its half-hearted bid to buy the ORG6 news chain at a bankruptcy auction [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]1 suggested it would lay off17 1,000 employees if it took over. In contrast, the winning bidder, ORG23, has vowed to keep all employees on staff18 and honor union contracts, although its record with a Canadian news chain tells a different story19 ORG23-controlled [LOCATION] has cut its work force, shuttered papers across GPE24, reduced salaries and benefits, and centralized editorial operations in a [STREET] that has made parts of its 106 newspapers into clones of one another, according to [ORGANIZATION].Private equity firms and hedge funds like [ORGANIZATION]1 drain news companies of any financial safety nets they once had, leaving them extra-vulnerable to crises like the current recession. These companies have baldly extracted papers cash reserves [ORGANIZATION]1 admitted in [STREET] [DATE] that it took hundreds of millions from its papers to invest in unrelated businesses that have since gone bankrupt. Theyve also stripped newspapers of their real estate, the collateral that businesses traditionally tap when they need loans to weather hard times.Instead of putting extra boots on the ground to cover the current crisis, [ORGANIZATION]3 and [ORGANIZATION]8 immediately issued nationwide layoffs, furloughs, and buyouts as soon as the pandemic shutdown beganwithout pausing to first gauge its economic impact.The irony is that while papers print advertising has indeed tanked during the shutdown, their online news subscriptions have [LOCATION], thanks to a public desperate for timely, trustworthy information.In the past, a crisis of any magnitudemuch less this life-changing moment in human historywould have meant all hands on deck, even if publishers had to dip into reserves or borrow against the ORG35 assets. No more ORG37 to cover? Fine, reassign the ORG37 desk to report on the towns [ORGANIZATION] testing capacity or the ORG36 latest shutdown order.But thats not what hedge funds do. [ORGANIZATION]1, in fact, furloughed many of its papers ORG37 and other staff DATE8. Hedge funds have shown, over and over, that they are ungrateful corporate citizens that want no investment in the social well-being of the communities these papers serve.The few reporters who remain in these skeleton news crews have proven that they are indeed essential workers. They bravely risk their lives as they report from hospitals, homeless shelters, and farm labor camps to tell fuller stories of the pandemics impact on all sectors of society.Yet other reporters, laid off or furloughed during this critical time, are posting on social media about their frustration at not being able to do their jobs.You might be looking for reports from the [ORGANIZATION]8 about this very serious flooding but the reporters who would have been working [TIME] are furloughed, tweeted22 [ORGANIZATION]1 [ORGANIZATION]8 reporter PERSON7.Former [ORGANIZATION]2 Sun reporter [ORGANIZATION] thisFurloughed wo pay DATE9 at the [ORGANIZATION]2 Sunhealth reporter [PERSON], in the midst of a pandemiccops reporter [PERSON], after [PERSON]0 of 8 murdersace political feature writer Tim_Prudente26, [PERSON]1 before huge mayoral election.Am I missing anyone, [ORGANIZATION]8??There have been rumblings in [ORGANIZATION]1 about making hedge funds and private equity more transparent, but to date theres been little headway. Now, before theres no one left to report on it, its time to ask whether private equity and hedge funds should be allowed in the news business at all.If hedge funds remain in the news business, they need to be fully transparent. Stakeholdersemployees, readers, and the general publicneed to know their investors, their managers, and their corporate governance. Likewise, if hedge funds remain in news, they need to be located in GPE20. There is a good reason campaign finance laws prohibit donations from foreign nationals. The same should be applied to news.  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27"

From an inside job to an unidentified umbrella man, aliens, multiple gunmen and a joint effort. Between the [LOCATION]ns and the Soviets have been considered the perpetrators or directly involved in [PERSON] disappearance.DATE1 have passed since that fateful day in downtown [ORGANIZATION], when [PERSON], perched behind an upper floor window of the [PERSON] School Book Depository building, allegedly fired at [PERSON] convertible as the president rode through cheering crowds, striking him twice. DATE2, many are still searching for a satisfactory answer as to who really killed [ORGANIZATION], clinging to anything that looks leery in the hope that, if they try hard enough, the whole mystery will unravel.In ORG2 new documentary, [ORGANIZATION] What the Doctors Saw, we are treated to a re-examination of the discrepancy between the conclusions drawn by the doctors who first saw President [PERSON] at ORG3 who believe the hole in [PERSON] neck was an entry wound and the subsequent autopsy which claimed the neck hole was an exit wound, with accusations that undue influence was exerted on the latter medical team.Meanwhile, filmmaker PERSON5 has launched a new ORG4 series with journalist [PERSON], who claims to have groundbreaking new evidence about who killed [ORGANIZATION] both cases, these programs primarily serve people for whom the assassination of [PERSON], and the circumstances surrounding it, was not a redefinition of his presidency, but arguably its defining moment.Rumors of government conspiracies and mob-orchestrated hits have so pervaded popular culture particularly after the release of [ORGANIZATION] blockbuster film, [ORGANIZATION], that it would not be unfair to suggest that most post-Baby Boomer GPE24ns know a great deal about [PERSON] death. More than his life.Sixty-five percent of GPE24ns have heard, and believe, that a conspiracy was behind the assassination of John Fitzgerald [PERSON] on [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION]. What would the polls have shown if [ORGANIZATION] had asked respondents if they had heard about other events in the life? Of the 35th president of GPE2 [PERSON] presidents have been assassinated. But why is [PERSON] assassination the only one to generate thousands of conspiracy theories that challenge the official story?On [PERSON], the audience at FAC0 witnessed the assassination of President [PERSON] by a shot to the back of the head, after which the assassin, [PERSON]0 , jumped on stage and shouted Sic semper tyrannis! although the exact wording has been debated.On [ORGANIZATION], those gathered at the ORG6 station, including Secretary of ORG7 [PERSON]1 and Secretary of War [PERSON]2 eldest son, witnessed the assassination of President [PERSON], when The Aspiring Politician [PERSON]4 shot him from behind at point-blank range.On [PERSON], all the curious well-wishers gathered in FAC1 at the Pan-GPE24n Exposition in GPE4 witnessed the assassination of President [PERSON]5 , when anarchist [PERSON]6 shot him twice in the abdomen during a handshake, using an Ivor [PERSON]7on Revolver concealed in a handkerchief.Who was in charge of investigating [ORGANIZATION] assassination is also marred by ambiguity due to the amount of information that apparently slipped through the cracks of the first official investigation, often referred to as [ORGANIZATION]. How could the [ORGANIZATION] ORG7s of [ORGANIZATION] be any less capable of gathering information about the death of a president than the [ORGANIZATION] ORG7s of [PERSON]?For that, lets consider how much GPE24n life had changed since [PERSON]. It was only after President [PERSON]7 death DATE10 that [ORGANIZATION], an organization initially created to combat counterfeit currency, was tasked with protecting the presidents life.[PERSON]7 death also led President [PERSON]8 and Attorney General [PERSON] to create ORG10, which when [PERSON] took office would become known as [ORGANIZATION], under the controversial leadership of [PERSON]0.And most significantly, the [ORGANIZATION] ORG7s of [PERSON] was hardly on the global stage as it was after the first two world wars. Our vast entanglements in the world at large, as well as the Cold War brewing with [ORGANIZATION], would lead to the creation of ORG12 through [ORGANIZATION] of 1947.What happened on DATE11 of [PERSON] assassination?It is impossible to summarize something as complex as the [ORGANIZATION] assassination in less than the space of a book. In fact, [ORGANIZATION] to [ORGANIZATION] by [PERSON]1 , published in [PERSON], estimates that approximately 40,000 books have been published about [ORGANIZATION] and his untimely death.But these two paragraphs from [PERSON]s full biography profile do the jobOn [DATE], [ORGANIZATION], President [PERSON] flew to GPE7, [PERSON], for a campaign appearance. [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], along with his wife and [PERSON] Governor [PERSON]3, rode through cheering crowds in downtown [ORGANIZATION] in a ORG1. From an upstairs window of the [PERSON] School Book Depository building, a DATE16 warehouse worker named [PERSON], a former Marine with Soviet sympathies, fired at the car, hitting the president twice. [PERSON] died at ORG15 shortly thereafter, aged 46.A [ORGANIZATION] nightclub owner named [PERSON]4 assassinated [PERSON]5 DATE17 as he was being transferred between prisons. President [PERSON] death was an unspeakable national tragedy and, to [DATE], many people recall with eerie vividness the exact moment they learned of his death. While conspiracy theories have circulated since [PERSON] assassination, the official version of events remains the most plausible [PERSON]5 acted alone.Each conspiracy theory has been the subject of books, documentaries, feature films and too many exhaustive podcasts. No single article could possibly pick apart and debunk each theory. However, here is a cursory look at the most prominent conspiracy theories that have consumed the GPE24n public consciousness since the [ORGANIZATION] assassination.[ORGANIZATION] assassination conspiracy theory 1 The ORG16 did it.The ORG16, particularly the GPE8 Outfit, tends to be a factor in many conspiracy theories surrounding the [ORGANIZATION] assassination, either as the sole culprit or as part of a larger conspiracy. Why would the ORG16 have wanted to target [PERSON]? Perhaps they were distraught over the closing of their casinos in [LOCATION], or perhaps [PERSON] father, Joseph [PERSON] , had mob connections because he made his fortune as a bootlegger.  He didnt .The most compelling argument for why the mob might want to kill a [PERSON] is that then Attorney General and [PERSON]7 brother Robert F. [PERSON] had made it a priority to dismantle organized crime, even publicly challenging ORG17 leader [PERSON]9 for his ties to multiple mob figures. as organized crime had successfully infiltrated several syndicates at this time. Conspiracy theorists also emphasize that [PERSON]4, the man who shot [PERSON] on [PERSON]5 [ORGANIZATION] while [PERSON]5 was in police custody, had some interactions with organized crime figures.But finding logic in killing [ORGANIZATION] rather than [ORGANIZATION]0 who would be gunned down in DATE19 by [ORGANIZATION]1 , in connection with the [ORGANIZATION] conflicts of the time may prove challenging for those who simply dont want it to be true. And as [ORGANIZATION] notes , mob expert [ORGANIZATION]2 ...said he reviewed thousands of pages of electronic surveillance of organized crime leaders across the [ORGANIZATION] ORG7s at the time the assassination occurred and heard nothing suspicious.[ORGANIZATION] Assassination Conspiracy Theory 2 The Soviets did it.Yes, [PERSON] lived in the [PERSON]0 for a while. But the [PERSON]0 did not have [PERSON] killed.This particular line of thinking has diminished considerably in DATE20. This is largely because, by now, if there were any evidence of Soviet involvement in the [ORGANIZATION] assassination, we probably would have found it. [PERSON]1 dissolved in DATE3 DATE21 PERSON7 [ORGANIZATION] was released, and amid all that we learned from the ORG18 files that later emerged, from FAC2 biological weapons facility, [PERSON], to the secret FAC4 beneath [PERSON]2, there has not been even the slightest evidence to suggest that the [PERSON]0 was behind the [ORGANIZATION] assassination.In fact, [PERSON] was actively working to find peace and understanding between the two superpowers. He corresponded with Premier [ORGANIZATION]4 much of which can be read on [ORGANIZATION] website, and even established a hotline with [PERSON]2. The two leaders also seemed to like each other personally. Once, [ORGANIZATION]4 even gave the [PERSON] a dog, which was appropriately named Pushinka.However, we now know that there was actually a Soviet plot related to the [PERSON] assassination. And if youve ever shared a conspiracy theory for the [ORGANIZATION] assassination, youre part of it.In DATE22, a ORG18 archivist named [ORGANIZATION]5 defected to the [PERSON]3, bringing with him a trove of official documents he had absconded with over his DATE23 career. These documents revealed that the ORG18 had actually worked to spread misinformation that the [ORGANIZATION] was behind the [ORGANIZATION] assassination, going so far as to forge a letter from [PERSON] to [ORGANIZATION] officer [ORGANIZATION]6 best known DATE24 for his involvement in the Watergate case. theft to implicate him and the [ORGANIZATION] in the assassination.[ORGANIZATION] Assassination Conspiracy Theory 3 The [LOCATION]ns Did ItOver DATE25, many people have postulated that the [LOCATION]ns were behind the [ORGANIZATION] assassination. The problem is that they cant seem to agree on who the [LOCATION]ns are pro-[PERSON]0 [LOCATION]ns? anti-[PERSON]0 [LOCATION]ns?In terms of motive, both are there. For the anti-[PERSON]0 [LOCATION]ns, there was the issue of the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion in [DATE] , a [ORGANIZATION]-backed coup attempt that [PERSON] had largely inherited from the [ORGANIZATION]7 administration and in which the [PERSON] reneged on its commitment to the very insurgents it had helped train afterwards. their covert activities became evident to the world. Moreover, recently discovered documents have shown that the GPE8 ORG16 was involved in the training of some of these [LOCATION]n exiles.Likewise, [ORGANIZATION]8 would surely have had motive to want to kill the head of the [PERSON] government. Why? Because the [PERSON] government literally would not stop trying to kill him.ORG22 , created in DATE27 to investigate the activities of the [ORGANIZATION], ORG23, [PERSON] and ORG25, found concrete evidence of at least eight plots involving the [ORGANIZATION] to assassinate [ORGANIZATION]8 [PERSON]. In DATE29, former [LOCATION]n intelligence chief [ORGANIZATION]9 claimed that over DATE30, [PERSON]0 had dodged 638 assassination attempts, 42 of which occurred during the [ORGANIZATION] administration.And, of course, [PERSON] founded a chapter of the Fair Play for [LOCATION] Committee in [PERSON]4, which put him on the ORG23s radar.But beyond the potential motive, we have no evidence to suggest that anyone on either side of the [LOCATION]n conflict other than [PERSON]0-obsessed [PERSON]5 played any role in [PERSON] assassination. And, in fact, until his death, [ORGANIZATION] was actively working to rebuild the [PERSON] relationship with [LOCATION] that had been broken by the previous administration .[ORGANIZATION] Assassination Conspiracy Theory 4 A secret society did it.Was [PERSON] part of an ORG28-style secret society that conspired to kill the president? The conspiracy theory is not as absurd as you think.In DATE31, two counterculture hipsters named [PERSON]1 and [PERSON]2 decided to create a satirical religion called ORG29. And since every religion needs its central text, [PERSON]3 and [PERSON]4 wrote [ORGANIZATION] and printed its first edition in [ORGANIZATION] on the copy machine of [PERSON]5, district attorney of [PERSON]5, [PERSON]6.In DATE32, prior to writing [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]3 completed the manuscript of his novel The Idle Warriors , which was a comic, fictionalized account of his time in ORG30. His main character, [PERSON]6, was based on a fellow Marine who swore he was a Communist and then defected to [ORGANIZATION] - [PERSON].Usually, writing a funny novel about a former communist ORG31 connection, plus a faux religious text for a satirical cult, wont get you in trouble. But when that Communist Marine you once knew kills the president of the [ORGANIZATION] ORG7s and you photocopy your cult manifesto on the machine belonging to the conspiracy-obsessed [PERSON]4 district attorney desperate to implicate people in the assassination plot, thats a different story. . As [PERSON]7 DATE33 Caught in the Crossfire conveys , [PERSON]3 spent so much time being falsely accused of being part of the conspiracy to assassinate [ORGANIZATION] that he began to believe he was actually an unwitting pawn in someone elses game.[ORGANIZATION] Assassination Conspiracy Theory 5 The [PERSON] Government Did ItOver DATE34, virtually every facet of the [PERSON] government has been implicated in the [ORGANIZATION] assassination through some book, blog or TV special.This is a particularly frightening accusation. The suggestion that a federal government, particularly one that so often touts freedom as its central ideal, would kill its own leader would have been considered largely out of [STREET] prior to [ORGANIZATION]. And to be clear, there is not, nor has there ever been, any evidence that clearly links any part of the [PERSON] government to the specific act of [PERSON] assassination.To believe that the government was behind the [ORGANIZATION] assassination is to rely on both the governments lack of total transparency during the investigation and the revelations of other illegal and unethical activities that came to light throughout [ORGANIZATION]. These specific conspiracy theories act less as a solution to a murder and more as a portrait of the erosion of public trust that can occur in the absence of government accountability.Take, for example, the suggestion that the ORG23 was behind the [PERSON] assassination. Proponents of this conspiracy theory point to tenuous connections such as the ORG23 being aware of [PERSON]5 and possibly harassing him according to [PERSON]5s own accusations , as well as a memo from [PERSON]0 expressing the need to convince the public that [PERSON]5 is the real assassin.Later revelations about documented ORG23 activity in DATE35, such as the targeted harassment of [PERSON]9 , the covert and illegal activities of [ORGANIZATION], the provision of information leading to the assassination of PERSON50, and PERSON51 personal involvement in the domestic surveillance of countless GPE24n citizens and the crafting of inaccurate posthumous narratives surrounding figures such as PERSON52 damaged the ORG33 reputation in a [STREET] that took DATE36 to shake.Some conspiracy theorists have suggested that Vice President [PERSON] [PERSON]7on was behind the [ORGANIZATION] assassination. This fringe theory was rooted in the idea that [PERSON]7on feared [PERSON] would take him off the list in [LOCATION], and that [PERSON] intended to de-escalate a war in [PERSON]7 as evidenced by [PERSON]M 263 issued on [DATE], [ORGANIZATION] from which [PERSON]7on was out to personally profit. Such a suggestion besmirches the memory and legacy of two presidents, [PERSON] and [PERSON]7on on one occasion, ORG34 even had to publicly apologize for airing a television episode that exposed this particular conspiracy theory.In a DATE19 book, [PERSON] secretary, [PERSON] ORG13, suggested that the president had conveniently revealed to her privately , DATE39 before his death, that he intended to drop [PERSON]7on as his running mate in favor of PERSON56 of [PERSON]8. But there is no public evidence to support this. In fact, on [DATE], [ORGANIZATION] , [PERSON] dispelled any rumors of a change of running mates. And considering that he was in [ORGANIZATION] on DATE41 as part of a larger tour of [PERSON] to drum up support in the [PERSON]9 state, that [PERSON]won narrowly in [LOCATION] because he had a [PERSON] senator on his ticket, replacing him with a North Carolinian seems an odd calculation.Then there are the Pentagon Papers. The works of historians, pro-[PERSON]7on or not, largely agree that [PERSON] [PERSON]7on shed his blood, sweat and tears to achieve not only the highest position of power in the land, but to push progressive policies while he was there, especially the Civil Rights Acts of [LOCATION] and DATE19. However, reading the pages that PERSON58 leaked to the GPE24n public showed just how much other peoples blood [PERSON]7on was willing to shed.We now know, thanks to those leaked documents, that the [PERSON] withheld some of the truth about the [PERSON]7 War from the GPE24n public. We know that the PERSON59 administration pushed through the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution under false pretenses,  authorizing President [PERSON]7on to take any action he believed necessary to retaliate and promote the maintenance of international peace and security in [LOCATION] .We know that during the [PERSON]7on administration, ORG35 revised its rationale for prolonging combat in [PERSON]7 to 70 percent to avoid a humiliating defeat of the [ORGANIZATION] ORG7s. And we know that faced with Secretary of ORG36 [PERSON]0 suggestion in DATE43 that the [ORGANIZATION] ORG7s begin to withdraw from [PERSON]7, [PERSON]7on approved increasing the [PERSON] troop commitment to nearly 550,000.For the conspiracy-minded, it was easy to draw parallels between the controversial DATE44 funding approval, which then newly elected Congressman [PERSON] [PERSON]7on pushed on behalf of the ORG37 firm, which had donated heavily to the [PERSON]7on campaign, and how in DATE45 the ORG38 consortium was formed to build naval facilities in [LOCATION], particularly [PERSON]7.DATE46, the consortium was simply ORG39 and ORG40 The BR that was added under President [PERSON]7on to become ORG38? ORG41Similar to how the Pentagon Papers added fuel to the PERSON59 did it fire, DATE47 have seen a resurgence of the fringe [ORGANIZATION] accidentally shot [PERSON] theory, first proposed by ballistics expert [PERSON]1 in the pages of [LOCATION] in [LOCATION], and had a wider audience in [PERSON]2 DATE22 [PERSON] The Shot That Killed [ORGANIZATION] .This theory proposes that while [PERSON] fired two shots from the sixth floor of the [PERSON] Book Depository, the third shot, the one that killed the president, was actually fired by a [ORGANIZATION] agent armed with an AR-15 in the car behind the presidents limousine. According to the theory, [ORGANIZATION]s interference in the investigations was designed to cover up its own mistake. Timely, this fringe theory is re-circulated whenever demonstrable [ORGANIZATION] misconduct appears in the news, such as [ORGANIZATION] Summit of the GPE24s VI affair , or the revelation of deleted texts in the midst of the [PERSON]0 hearings.And finally, there is ORG12. Conspiracy theorists point to the fact that President [PERSON] allegedly said he wanted to fragment the [ORGANIZATION] into a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds although that quote first surfaced from an anonymous source [PERSON]1 after his death . They mention that the [ORGANIZATION] knew much more about [PERSON] than they initially let on. And they remind us that [PERSON]3, [ORGANIZATION] director until President [PERSON] fired him after the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion, was later one of the seven men on [ORGANIZATION] set up to investigate the assassination.But the most damning indictment against the [ORGANIZATION] regarding the [PERSON] assassination is not what we know it is what no one knew. No one knew what the [ORGANIZATION] was really doing in the early [LOCATION]s. And that includes ORG45.According to [PERSON]4 [PERSON]3 A Cruel and Shocking Act The Secret History of the [PERSON] Assassination, [ORGANIZATION]0 [PERSON] directly asked then-[ORGANIZATION] Director [PERSON]6 if the [ORGANIZATION] had anything to do with the [ORGANIZATION] assassination. I asked him in a [STREET] that he couldnt lie to me, [ORGANIZATION]0 recalled, ... and he said they hadnt.The [ORGANIZATION] that the [PERSON] inherited from the [ORGANIZATION]7 administration was one that [ORGANIZATION]7 himself could not or would not control. During [ORGANIZATION]7s presidency, the [ORGANIZATION] had already staged covert coups to overthrow the democratically elected leaders of [ORGANIZATION] , as well as having provided the encouragement, and sometimes even the weapons, that led to the death of the Prime Minister. [PERSON]8 of [PERSON] and President [PERSON]9 of GPE23.[ORGANIZATION]0 [PERSON] knew firsthand what the [ORGANIZATION] was capable of, having been directly involved in the assassination plots against [ORGANIZATION]8. When [ORGANIZATION]0 allegedly asked the [ORGANIZATION] if they had killed his brother, the possibility that the agency had done so no substantial evidence suggests that this was true was not the scary part. Rather, the fact that the [ORGANIZATION] had become unwieldy and irresponsible enough to even entertain the idea that it might have done it was more alarming.[ORGANIZATION] assassination conspiracy theory 6 [PERSON]5 did it, all by himself.Of course, the likely reality is that [PERSON] acted alone in killing [ORGANIZATION]. And [PERSON]5 was not a [PERSON] or a secret agent. He was simply a man who thought he was destined to matter and lashed out at anyone he felt was preventing him from achieving it. He clung to communism, to [LOCATION], to anything that made him feel a sense of purpose.And on [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]5 decided that his purpose was to kill the president of the [ORGANIZATION] ORG7s. Just as on [DATE], [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]5 decided his purpose was to kill conservative politician General PERSON70, although the bullet [PERSON]5 fired from the same PERSON71 rifle he would later use at [ORGANIZATION] narrowly missed its target. And just as another man searching for a sense of purpose, [PERSON]4, would take [PERSON]5s life with the pull of a trigger on [PERSON]5 [ORGANIZATION].The decisions of two men gave rise to [PERSON]6 of conspiracy theories, often put forward by those who are convinced they can finally solve a mystery whose real solution simply cannot be accepted.For to accept that solution would mean accepting that no one, not even the President of the [ORGANIZATION] ORG7s, is as safe as government systems promise us we are. It means accepting that a symbol of hope and a new frontier can be extinguished by one man with an army surplus rifle he bought for 20. And that his actions were not tied to any complex conspiracy. It was just a moment of chaos, where coincidences aligned to tear the country apart. A lot of people would rather believe in a conspiracy theory because, somehow, that makes them feel like they are in control. That there are rules to the game, that there is a system and that we can all be safe if we do what we are told.Why do we still believe in conspiracy theories about the [ORGANIZATION] assassination?Conspiracy theorists continue to venture down the rabbit hole of the [ORGANIZATION] assassination in hopes of finding something new. This mystery continues to haunt GPE24 [PERSON]6 later, and thats something we predicted would happen [PERSON]6 ago. Heres how PERSON72, deputy editor-in-chief of [ORGANIZATION], described the situation in his introduction to the [LOCATION] publication of The [ORGANIZATION] ReportThe legend of President [PERSON] death began with the sniper rifle shot that took his life. It was born at [TIME] on [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], when the lethal bullet screeched toward his body. It has grown steadily since then. moment.As a ORG47 editor commented when he read the bulletin announcing the Presidents death at 135 p.m. [ORGANIZATION]1 In [PERSON]9 there will be men still arguing and writing about the Presidents death.Nothing that has happened since then seems to invalidate that assessment. Not even [ORGANIZATION] can be expected to undermine the [PERSON] legend. But this legend gives [PERSON] the last word. And there are other far more deserving voices that need to be heard.While a host of films and podcasts seek to commemorate the 60th anniversary of [PERSON] assassination by solving the mystery, [ORGANIZATION]0 [PERSON] in [ORGANIZATION] Town From [ORGANIZATION] to K2 chooses to focus on the people and [STREET] that were not simply transformed [ORGANIZATION]1, but continue to transform afterward.The filmmakers talk with PERSON73, in her first interview in [ORGANIZATION]2, about how inadvertently taking photographs at the time of [PERSON] death impacted her profoundly. And the film examines how the local community that conspiracy theorists have preserved in metallic amber since [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], has developed real, solvable problems, such as drug abuse and homelessness.If anyone should have had the last word on the [PERSON] presidency, it was President [PERSON] himself. But [ORGANIZATION] is the only president since PERSON74 who did not write a presidential memoir, and the first since PERSON75 whose legacy is defined not by his own pen, but by an assassins bullet.To address how the assassination has come to define, for many, the entirety of [PERSON] legacy, we spoke with the director of the [ORGANIZATION] Presidential Museum and [PERSON], PERSON76. Do you find it frustrating that so many people obsess about [PERSON] assassination rather than his life?Its perhaps not surprising that such a tragic event, which brought down such an inspirational leader, is at the forefront of public curiosity, PERSON77 says. People find it difficult, intellectually and emotionally, to understand."

The girl was a victim in a case the officer was investigating and had already been raped by someone else. Detective [ORGANIZATION]5, [PERSON], was assigned to [PERSON]3, a unit tasked with investigation cases of sex crimes against children. [ORGANIZATION]6 was arrested on [ORGANIZATION] on suspicion of rape by force and preventing or dissuading a witness or victim from testifying, said [ORGANIZATION]7, spokeswoman for the departments [PERSON]4. Given the number of victims [ORGANIZATION]6 has had contact with in the past, this case has caused grave concern at the department. According to [PERSON]5, [ORGANIZATION]6 has investigated dozens of child molestation cases in [LOCATION] as a member of the elite specialized unit.88 Federal Judge [PERSON] Genital Mutilation [PERSON] Unconstitutional89 In a major blow to the government, a federal judge in [PERSON] has declared the nations female genital mutilation law unconstitutional, thereby dismissing nearly all of the charges against two [ORGANIZATION] doctors and seven others accused of subjecting at least nine minor girls to genital cutting in the nations first [ORGANIZATION] case. The historic case involves minor girls from [ORGANIZATION], GPE7 and GPE8, including some who cried, screamed and bled during the procedure and one who was given [PERSON] ground in liquid [ORGANIZATION] to keep her calm, [STREET] records [PERSON] on [ORGANIZATION], Sexual Assault at [PERSON]6 Store in GPE9 [PERSON]0  A [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]1 woman was shot and killed by a gunman at a [PERSON]6 store in a strip mall on FAC0 on [TIME], police said. They identified her [PERSON]0 [TIME] as [ORGANIZATION]8, a customer at the store, where the gunman sexually assaulted at least one person before opening fire and then disappearing. [PERSON]0 [TIME] police released a detailed description of the attacker, saying he was a white man, [PERSON]1, and 5 feet 7 inches to 5 feet 9 inches tall. He was wearing a black or gray paperboy-style cap, a [ORGANIZATION] blue [PERSON]7-style jacket, a red, white and black plaid shirt, glasses, a brown belt with a a red and blue square on the buckle. The shooting was reported to police at [TIME], and police shut down the shopping center and launched a manhunt that lasted into the night92 [PERSON]2 Actors [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON]3 After Democrats Loss93 Several [PERSON]2 actors are calling for a boycott of [PERSON]3s film industry after Republican [ORGANIZATION]9 officially won the states gubernatorial contest against Democrat PERSON20. But like the threats to move to [PERSON]4 if Donald [ORGANIZATION] won in [DATE], these are also more than likely going to be hollow.94 [PERSON] Professor [PERSON] [PERSON]8 to Expose Anti-Asian Preferences95 What are they hiding? The data will either exonerate or incriminate [PERSON]9 A law professor at [PERSON]9LA has filed a lawsuit against the [PERSON]8 System for withholding records he believes could show its illegally using race in admissions. While [PERSON]9 claims it doesnt have the specific data set requested by PERSON22, the professor told ORG22 that the same kind of data was provided to us [PERSON]2 Politicians and Police Set Tyrannys Perfect Example Gun Confiscation97 As a review of some of the current events that have been taking [STREET] in the [PERSON]5 recently, on [PERSON]3, [PERSON]6 Police in [PERSON]7 shot and killed a man as they attempted to exercise a red flag gun removal order. Those red flag orders went into effect on [PERSON]4. [PERSON]ts take the definition of this new game directly from ORG[ORGANIZATION]2 and examine it A red flag law is a gun violence protection law that permits police or family members to petition a state [STREET] to order the temporary removal of firearms from a person who may present a danger to others or themselves. A judge makes the determination to issue the order based on statements and actions made by the gun owner in question. After a set time, the guns are returned to the person from whom they were seized unless another [STREET] hearing extends the period of confiscation. Such orders are known as [ORGANIZATION] ERPO in [PERSON]8, [PERSON]9, [PERSON]7, and [ORGANIZATION]0, as Risk Protection Orders in [PERSON] as Gun Violence Restraining Orders in GPE[ORGANIZATION]6 as risk warrants in [ORGANIZATION]2 and as Proceedings for the Seizure and Retention of a [ORGANIZATION] in GPE[ORGANIZATION]2. Returning to the incident in [PERSON]7, take a look at this excerpt from [PERSON] from [PERSON]5 Neither of the officers were injured. Their names werent released. It wasnt clear why the red flag order was issued. A spokeswoman for the [PERSON]7 Judiciary denied a request from ORG[ORGANIZATION]8 to release protection order requests associated with the home, citing the law which states the orders are confidential unless a [STREET] rules otherwise. PERSON[ORGANIZATION]2, the mans niece, told ORG[ORGANIZATION]8 that one of her aunts requested the protective order against PERSON24, but she declined to say why. [PERSON]7s law, which went into effect [PERSON]6, is more broad in that it allows certain health care providers to seek an order, in addition to family members and law enforcement. LOOK HOW THINGS WORK IN THE TOTALITARIAN HEIR TO THE SOVIET [LOCATION]0ION THAT [ORGANIZATION]4 HAS BECOME! Sounds as if its so[LOCATION]ing right out of PERSON[LOCATION], but here it is The names of the cops were not released. [ORGANIZATION] could not report on associated case actions. PERSON[ORGANIZATION]8 of the ORG28 [PERSON]7 Judiciary using a law to prevent the publics knowledge without [STREET] approval. ORG28 ...blic Censorship An aunt reported himbut no reasons given by family or police. Finger-Pointing initiated [ORGANIZATION] reporters and family members can blow the whistle and enable these red flag orders to be set in motion. [PERSON]21 Powers of Arrest and complete abrogation of rights under the Constitution of GPE74 with no recourse Thats it. Everyone with the [ORGANIZATION]70 Spartans patch and the ???? ?a? or ???O? ???? written on their sleeves?  Translation Come and Take it!  Yes, they will. They are. For now, theyre attempting to do it without a fightpassing the legislation or circumventing it, rather and forcing the compliance of the citizenry. They are in the process of doing far more, and another episode really su[PERSON]arizes the key concept the Totalitarian mindset of elected officials. This piece is entitled, GPE[ORGANIZATION]6 Democrat threatens [LOCATION] if Americans dont hand over their guns. This threat is not figurative it is literal. I strongly reco[PERSON]end reading the whole article. Democratic Congressman PERSON27 D, GPE[LOCATION] is proposing that the government offer up to 1,000 for semi-automatic weapons, and a buy-back to [STREET] those firearms in the hands of the governmentfor an estimated cost of 15 billion This man should be removed from office i[PERSON]ediately, no questions askedplaced upon administrative leave and then brought to bear for his statement. The mindset is the danger this is not the exception among politicians, but the norm. In these neo-feudal times, you the citizen are expected to wear your uniform, the tan called [ORGANIZATION] fabric composition substituted for a color pants, and the red shirt of ORG29 or the [ORGANIZATION] blue shirt of ORG[ORGANIZATION]7. Wear them, and the little name tag, and give half of what you make to the governmentand allow them to craft your livesas you obey. Once again, the PERSON28 character in The [PERSON] portrayed by PERSON29 characters lines were correct An elected legislature can trample a mans rights as easily as a king. They are coming for the guns. They are marching forward with their legislation, to provide legitimacy for their actions under the color of law. Their doorkickers are ass-kickers, in good shape and sharp reflexes with good mental acumen. They are psychologically protected to allow them to act with full force without restraint protected with direct deposit of their check, protected with life insurance, and protected with healthcare for their familiesall of their basics taken care of, plus a badge theyre covered, when they come for the citizens. The last step for a full-blown tyranny before the actual collapse political, military, economic, or a combination thereof is evident in the tyrannical measures and inflictions they foster against their own populace.98 Report PERSON[ORGANIZATION]7 [PERSON] [PERSON]1 Probe of [PERSON]2 Workplace Safety99 According to the [PERSON]9 Post, [PERSON]1 will launch an extensive safety review of [PERSON]2 and [PERSON]4, assessing the culture of the two private companies tapped to fly the agencys astronauts.

So the [LOCATION]0 is now pushing for international law, criminalizing any country that disagrees with their open borders.106 Voters Electing Democrats Who Despise Them107 PERSON32 might not be able to stand in the middle of FAC1, shoot someone, and lose no support, but she could and did insult the very voters she was trying to woo and be the next duly-elected senator from GPE32. The former [LOCATION]1 gadfly and 9th [LOCATION] has at last been declared the winner of PERSON33 departed [LOCATION]2 seat. Shes the first [ORGANIZATION] Democrat to win a [LOCATION]2 election in [PERSON]9. Shes also the first high-profile politician that I know who spent [DATE]0 mocking her own constituents as drug-addled nincompoops, only to, in the end, receive their backing. PERSON34 record of contempt for her own people is nonpareil. The [STREET] she openly and endlessly complains about the loons in her state is akin to an elderly crank who never stops complaining about the one time the cable company once tried to upcharge him for [LOCATION]3. On multiple occasions, PERSON[ORGANIZATION]3 has referred to her home state as crazy, a [LOCATION] lab for democracy, and an accursed [STREET] no good ever emerges from. Not once, it seems, did she ever stop to think how this obloquy reflects on her an [ORGANIZATION]n, after all. One is reminded of PERSON36 classic quote By dint of railing at idiots, one runs the risk of becoming an idiot oneself. Despite her best attempts to shower voters with disdain, PERSON[ORGANIZATION]3 defeated her opponent, PERSON37, a decorated war pilot with the distinction of being the first woman to ever fly a [PERSON]5 [ORGANIZATION] combat mission. Perhaps the self-loathing [ORGANIZATION]n was right this whole time [ORGANIZATION]ns went with the pink-tutu accoutered [LOCATION]4 sympathizer over a distinguished veteran. Quite a fine accomplishment for a state previously represented by the late PERSON38. Co[PERSON]ent Bottom line now the veneer has come off and Democrat ugliness is being revealed everywhere never, ever vote for a Democrat ie Co[PERSON]unist.108 [ORGANIZATION] [LOCATION]5 Member [PERSON] on, Punches Conservative Activist109 Police arrested a DATE[ORGANIZATION]6 [LOCATION]5 protester [PERSON]8 for allegedly punching and spitting on conservative activists taking part in the [LOCATION]6 rally in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]8.

PERSON50, leader of the [ORGANIZATION]7 [PERSON], said in a speech to ORG63 that neither the ORG64 nor ORG61 would endorse such an extreme and frankly dangerous course. He said [ORGANIZATION]7 will not countenance a no-deal [ORGANIZATION]5, which could cause upheaval for businesses and people. But it is unclear what would happen if ORG61 rejected the deal when it is put to a vote, likely DATE[ORGANIZATION]8. PERSON50 said the proposed agreement is a botched, worst-of-all-worlds deal which is bad for [LOCATION]. [ORGANIZATION]7 is calling for [LOCATION] to stay in a customs union with the ORG65 and to have a strong relationship with the blocs single market.

She was then asked for proof of address but given no clear instructions where to send this and then she received notification her account had been suspended. Other [PERSON] members told her they had the same experience. PERSON53 MEP, [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]ader, sla[PERSON]ed the nakedly political actions of ORG67.

Its a direct attack on the idea that young people or any with unwanted same-sex desires are entitled to professional counseling. The cast includes [ORGANIZATION]21 and [ORGANIZATION]22, who play PERSON45ian parents who coerce their DATE[ORGANIZATION]6 son into what the film calls a gay conversion therapy program. Not surprisingly, the media are promoting the film. In a brief review, the [PERSON]9 Post claimed that, by one estimate, nearly 700,000 Americans have been subjected to whats known as conversion therapy, a practice that attempts to change ones sexual orientation and  without evidence of efficacy  is still legal in 41 states. Think they have an agenda? Why not frame it In nine states, clients constitutional rights have been violated by state laws preventing them from getting the professional counseling they need to help them recover their natural sexuality. And In 14 states, parents are barred from securing licensed reparative therapy for their children. In his paper, [ORGANIZATION] SOCE Effective? Are They Harmful? What the Evidence Shows, [PERSON]30 Senior Fellow for Policy [ORGANIZATION]23 su[PERSON]arizes Critics of SOCE make two claims  that it is ineffective, and that it is harmful. Six studies or surveys from [ORGANIZATION]1 are reviewed, all of which show that SOCE can be effective for some clients in bringing about significant change in some components of sexual orientation. Few harms were reported. Older reports, including 600 studies and five meta-analyses, showed the same. One widely-cited report on harms, with a sample selected for that purpose, offered almost entirely anecdotal rather than statistical evidence. These studies make clear that the evidence for the effectiveness of SOCE far outweighs the evidence of its harm.  [ORGANIZATION], Representative [ORGANIZATION]24 Make my Day Gun control advocates are tactically referring to this proposed effort as a buyback for the same reason restauranteurs call the Patagonian toothfish a Chilean sea bass on their menus. A government buyback of guns may sound much more palatable for the American public than a forcible government confiscation of firearms, but it doesnt change the nature of the thing. The actual choice for Americans, under [ORGANIZATION]24s proposal, would be to sell their guns to the government, surrender them with no recompense, or have the government forcibly confiscate them, with offenders facing prosecution or violence at the hands of government agents. This is, of course, not a choice at all, but it presents the veneer of choice, meant to hide the constitutional rights that would be stolen from American citizens. But whats most amazing about all of this is the ease with which the confiscation of heretofore-legal firearms from millions of Americans is being proposed in open forums DATE44. It is, after all, impossibly illogical to conclude that such an action by the federal government would not be in direct violation of the Second Amendment.[ORGANIZATION]22 Its Official  [PERSON] is [PERSON] in [DATE] as [PERSON]21 Votes to Make it Optional to [ORGANIZATION] on the Birth Certificate  and Turncoat Liberal Speaker Made the Casting Vote[ORGANIZATION]23 [PERSON]20 has passed landmark transgender rights laws through the lower house which include parents having to opt in to have a babys sex recorded on birth certificates.[ORGANIZATION]24 Mentally Retarded Children Being Sterilized Under Trans Agenda[ORGANIZATION][LOCATION] Watch the most censored and banned broadcast in the world and learn about the globalist plans for you and your family before its too late [ORGANIZATION]26 breaks down the globalists [PERSON], which is meant in part to sterilize mentally ill children with hormone treatments.[ORGANIZATION][ORGANIZATION]8 Shock Video Kids Brainwashed to Hate White People[ORGANIZATION]27 Social justice indoctrination camp Children as young as [ORGANIZATION]2 brainwashed to hate white people and identify as different genders.

The department previously announced that DATE10 brought in 55.66 billion in foreign military sales, an uptick of 33 percent over DATE11 41.93 billion. Through [ORGANIZATION] process, the [PERSON] government serves as a go-between for foreign partners and [PERSON] industry. What had not been released until now is the total direct commercial sales, the process through which foreign customers can directly buy systems from industry. Those figures topped 136.6 billion for DATE10, a 6.6 percent increase from [PERSON]. But this is hardly accurate given that two arms sales packages to GPE4 equaled 287 BILLION all by themselves. It should be noted that the [PERSON] sold even more arms to GPE4. But I digress. PERSON3 [ORGANIZATION]0 writes The defense and aerospace industry is [ORGANIZATION] second-largest gross exporter. The industry contributes approximately 1 trillion DATE13 to the [PERSON] economy and employs around 2,500,000 people. On average, 30 percent of the industrys DATE14 revenue is through arms exports So, its sorta all about how you count. The point is that the [PERSON] is a machine that makes and sells weapons. We are historys number one death merchant. Now, arms sales globally have increased over 40 since [PERSON] according [ORGANIZATION]1. GPE6 and GPE7 are among those showing the largest growth. The Saudi market includes 31 billion dollars just in armoured vehicle purchases. And its growing. Although because under [ORGANIZATION] there were so many fighter jets sold to the Saudis and other [LOCATION] state monarchies that sales figures are likely to dip in the near future due to saturation. The government is essentially a branch of the death industry. [ORGANIZATION] wrote just DATE16 at [ORGANIZATION]2 After the resignation of Gen. [PERSON], Deputy Secretary of [ORGANIZATION]3 [ORGANIZATION] filled the post as interim head of the [ORGANIZATION]3 Department. Before joining the [LOCATION] administration, [ORGANIZATION] spent DATE17 working for [ORGANIZATION]5  a blatant conflict of interest for the person responsible for overseeing federal contracts with private defense contractors. Col. [PERSON], PERSON11 former chief of staff, called [ORGANIZATION] a living, breathing product of the military-industrial complex, and asserted that this revolving door keeps the national security elite very small, and very wealthy, and increasing its wealth as it goes up the chain. One egregious example of that revolving door is PERSON12, who has been secretary of [ORGANIZATION]6 since DATE18. In DATE19, [ORGANIZATION]7 paid a 4.7 million settlement to [ORGANIZATION]8 after the revelation it had used taxpayer funds to hire lobbyists for a 2.4 billion contract. One of the lobbyists was former [ORGANIZATION], ranked as one of the most corrupt members of [ORGANIZATION]9 by the nonprofit government watchdog group [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION]. [PERSON] was later confirmed as ORG21 secretary in the ORG22 by a 76-22 vote. PERSON14, the secretary of the ORG23, worked as vice president of government relations for [PERSON] before joining the [LOCATION] administration in DATE18. The ORG25 recognized PERSON15 as one of [LOCATION]s most powerful corporate lobbyists in DATE19 and [ORGANIZATION]0, where he fought to influence acquisition policy and other areas of defense bills. PERSON15s undersecretary, PERSON18, is a former ORG26 executive. So, back to [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]. First thing to note is that the narrative as always emphasizes the lone wolf gunmen idea, mentally unstable, a loner teased by classmates, bad haircut, etc. They might add he takes anti depressants and often, or hell, almost always, they do but rarely is the writing or the social connections and influences that shaped these young men investigated. In [PERSON]0, the PERSON19 story still tends to minimize the fascist connections that mass killer had throughout [PERSON]. Whatever the truth of these shootings as in, some witnesses saw three men dressed in black, etc the one certainty is that the state will follow a clear story-line and hit home certain key points. The second thing that will happen for certain is more calls for gun control  you know, that three trillion dollar industry in death led by GPE2. Remember here that some seventy thousand plus civilians have died in [PERSON]1 since the Saudi[PERSON] assault on that nearly defenseless nation. The poorest in the Arab world. Remember the millions upon millions who have been murdered across LOC2 in wars and conflicts often directly orchestrated by the [PERSON] And using [PERSON] made weapons. [PERSON]3 military aid to the rebels channeled unofficially through the illicit market, is routine and ongoing. In [DATE], a major [PERSON]3 sponsored shipment of a staggering 995 tons of weapons was conducted in blatant violation of the ceasefire. According to Janes [ORGANIZATION]3 Weekly, the [PERSON] is providing the weapons to [PERSON]4n rebel groups as part of a programme that continues despite the widely respected ceasefire in that country in [DATE]. PERSON20, ORG28, [ORGANIZATION]2 One of the secondary effects I suspect intentional of the government and law enforcement narrative on mass shooting incidents sic is one that emphasizes a need to control the mentally unstable a fluid definition that likely will include you and me at some point. Since the PERSON21 idea of future [PERSON] is now relatively mainstream the focus on mass state quarantines of those who serve as potential threats is clearly implied in the master narratives on these shootings. The bourgeoisie respond to the death of white people and OK, a few hispanics, too with exaggerated horror. They do not show such horror at the atrocities in [PERSON]1 or [PERSON]4 or [PERSON]5, committed by [PERSON]3NATO. But then the lone gunman story is containable and easily grasped by their truncated moral GPS. The white liberal does not scream gun control when cops execute another unarmed young black man or woman. Just as gun makers are ignored in the gun control logic, so are cops. The anti gun lobby seems okay with the idea that only steroid crazed racist policemen can carry guns. I have to tell you, Im not so OK with that. The familiarity of the rhetoric that surrounds these shootings has come to have a numbing effect. Still, it is important to note that as PERSON22 and PERSON23 observed that anti semitism grew in the [PERSON] after the defeat of the Nazis. So the love of guns and death seems to grow after each of these mass shootings. But the rise in gun related deaths contains another less advertised fact While much of the public attention is on the intense tragedies of gun massacres in the [PERSON]3 - DATE18 saw the deadliest mass shooting by an individual to take [STREET] in the country in modern history, when 58 people died in the [ORGANIZATION]3 rampage on [PERSON] - in fact most suffering takes [STREET] in isolated and lonely incidents that receive scant media coverage. Of those, suicide is by far the greatest killer, accounting for about 60 of all gun deaths. PERSON24, [PERSON]0, [ORGANIZATION]4 PERSON25, after the attack at the synagogue in [PERSON]6, wrote that the shootersanger that has got nothing to do with what they think they are angry about. They are just angry because of what life has done to them as children and then they find external targets. And this is what [PERSON] does too, of course. It provides an explanation, and a direction for the inarticulate rage. The [PERSON] is a stunningly sick society. I have grown weary of writing this fact because one finds oneself repeatedly in situations where this obvious truth must be stated..again. That sixty percent of gun deaths are suicide is a stunning statistic. The irrational hatred of the other is always equally a self hatred. And you have to see these narrative themes cropping up again and again in only indirectly related issues. Ive noted the racist eugenics backdrop to the overpopulation fear, a backdrop that finds partial expression in the work of [PERSON]1 foundation in LOC2  where the theme is sterilization. The [ORGANIZATION] then, regards LOC2, arms conflicts they  the [PERSON]  start, and at the same time work to stop reproduction on the continent. Eradication of the dark-skinned other is a theme that cuts across all these white psycho shooters and it cuts across the story of [ORGANIZATION]ern capital. Jews, blacks, Arabs, Hispanics  this is the legacy of colonialism and [PERSON] and [PERSON]an whiteness. [PERSON] exceptionalism. The very good PERSON26 [PERSON]2, [ORGANIZATION]2 wrote [PERSON]3 [PERSON]4 conducted a test of [PERSON], [PERSON]5 facial recognition software, which compared images of all the members of the [PERSON]3 [ORGANIZATION]9 with a database of mugshots. The results, according to [PERSON] 28 [PERSON]3 [ORGANIZATION]9people were identified as criminals. And what do you know the false matches pertained disproportionately to people of colour. Now imagine the complications that might arise when you have such technology in the hands of [PERSON]3 law enforcement officials who have already proven themselves predisposed to shooting black people for no reason. In addition to marketing its product to officials from [PERSON]3 [PERSON]7 [PERSON]8 and other notoriously abusive entities, [PERSON]9 has also pushed for [PERSON]s use in police body cameras - which would presumably only increase the chances of pre-emptive misidentification by trigger-happy forces of law and order. The arms industry comes to mind, which has helped to eradicate countless lives from [PERSON]7 to [PERSON]1 and beyond. And as PERSON27 stresses, it is important to remember in the [PERSON]3 context that what happens abroad matters and vice-versa. Case in point Technology is often tested on the bodies of [ORGANIZATION] people, perfected and then applied locally. As it turns out, the [PERSON]3 is also one of a group of countries opposing a ORG40-proposed ban on the development of so-called killer robots lethal autonomous weapons systems that use artificial intelligence - think facial recognition-equipped swarms of drones. The reality is that the violence of PERSON28 or PERSON29 or PERSON30 is one with the violence of [PERSON]8 or [PERSON]9. The [PERSON]3 occupies several countries as I write this, and has military bases spread across the world. Surrounding each base one will find spikes in public intoxication, fights, domestic abuse, rape and drug abuse. Nobody in those places want the [PERSON] military there. For the military is not only the expression of historical [PERSON] violence and racism, but it also horribly pollutes the areas in which it is located. For this is only another aspect of the violence. A psychic pollution, an emotional toxicity that is embedded in the uniform and the various repressions that entails. The military is the violence of the ruling elite made operative. I am reminded of two quotes of PERSON31 Im convinced that it is the psychopathic personality that searches out a uniform. Theres little doubt of whats going on in that mans head who will voluntarily don any uniform. PERSON32 [ORGANIZATION] of [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION]5 and Intellectuals still argue whether [PERSON] is a fascist country. This concern is typical of the [PERSON]n lefts flight from reality. This is actually a manifestation of the authoritarian process seeping into its own psyche. Blood in [ORGANIZATION], ORG41, [ORGANIZATION]6 Suggesting mental illness as the cause of these shooters violence is to distract from the institutional and class violence that exists all around them. In which each grew up. To focus disproportionately on their isolation or loneliness is almost ironic given they live in a society of acute crippling loneliness and in which suicide is rampant. A society in which isolation is manufactured by the state as only another strategy of control. Collectively breeds radicalization. If people start to talk to each other, they might start to dissent from these master narratives. Best to stop all institutions of the collective. Best to deride any political form of collectivitylike, oh, communism. Best to refer to socialism as something practiced by war monger PERSON33 or pseudo progressive PERSON34 that [STREET] the real socialism of PERSON35 or [PERSON] will not be investigated. Best to encourage stories of individualism and triumph over social adversity. Not stories of tearing down systems of oppression. Why is history being re-written? [ORGANIZATION], World War 2. Ask yourselves that rather simple question. Or the history of [LOCATION], or GPE23, or PERSON37 or PERSON38? Treat global pollution and climate change as if it were a GPE24 disaster movie. Stigmatize asking questions, ridicule dissenting voices, shame those who will not submit to the official narrative. And the question here in the shadow of [ORGANIZATION] is not the truth or falsity of the narrative but the insistence on a submission to it. This is the same logic you would find at GPE25 if you went back in time. The very same. Or GPE26, or [PERSON]. People are actually volunteering to stop having children. To stop flying. Voluntarily. Here is a clue, the [PERSON] military hasnt stopped flying. And whenever the ruling class is talking to you  you should distrust what they say. Full stop. And to underscore the racism2 so incrusted in [PERSON] society and the climate discourse. The populace [ORGANIZATION]7 is encouraged to trust in consensus. Trust in popularity. If a movie is popular, well, it must be good. If everyone says something is true, well, it must be. As PERSON39 said [ORGANIZATION]8, [PERSON]s are incapableof confronting a book unless it is successful.Lonely mentally ill young white men who shoot up public spaces do so because they can buy guns. And are mentally ill. In a society in which the economy is built upon mass violence and the manufacturing of guns, weapons, and ammunition. In which most new technology comes out of ORG42 research projects. Are the police who beat or abuse or kill blacks and hispanics and native [PERSON]sare they lonely and mentally ill? I mean, Id say yeah, but thats not the official narrative. And how many of those murderous policemen were veterans of the [PERSON] military? The [PERSON] teaches violence. It glorifies it and romanticizes it and sexualizes it. Of course, people are going to shoot each other. As [ORGANIZATION]9 life becomes more unreal, and more intolerable, the suffering will find an outlet. And the one that is met with least resistance is the buying of guns. Young men are trained to think in martial terms. And this is where [LOCATION] can be seen as the perfect foil for the ruling class and why he will be re-elected. When [LOCATION] starts to tweet his concerns about public safety he will I predict also begin a normalizing of martial law and internment camps. I mean, camps are already mostly in use, albeit in small ways still. But martial law has been tested already with the GPE27 marathon shooting and subsequent hunt for the bombers. An entire city was shut down with almost unanimous public approval. [ORGANIZATION]0, [ORGANIZATION] on [LOCATION]0, wrote The events in GPE27 have laid bare the modus operandi for the establishment of dictatorial forms of rule in the [PERSON]3. One or another violent act carried out by disoriented or disaffected individuals, perhaps with the help of elements within the state, is declared a terrorist event. A state of siege is imposed suspending democratic rights and establishing military-police control. And it occurred after Hurricane Katrina when the governor declared an state of emergency  evacuations were ordered and people were forced out of their homes and many businesses were closed. People were, in fact, removed to ORG45 camps. [LOCATION] would meet with only symbolic objections by [PERSON]. Some hand wringing and measured words of concern from [ORGANIZATION]1 or [ORGANIZATION]2 or [ORGANIZATION] no doubt support from ex cop [ORGANIZATION]3 and crypto-fascist [ORGANIZATION]4. Its for your own good, after all. In fact, its for the good of those put in these camps. This is a nation, remember, where the government already flies surveillance drones to spy on its own citizens, and helicopters patrol areas targeted as potentially high crime black and poor mostly and ORG47 teams increasingly are called out for routine offences  and where even small towns and some ORG48 have military surplus armoured fighting vehicles at their disposal. On [LOCATION]1, President [ORGANIZATION]5 signed the John Warner National [ORGANIZATION]3 Authorization Act [ORGANIZATION]. The law expanded Presidential authority to declare [PERSON] under revisions to the Insurrection Act. The law was rolled back slightly in [LOCATION]2 but [ORGANIZATION] then signed a new version of [ORGANIZATION] that would allow the arrest and detention of [PERSON] citizens without due process. [ORGANIZATION] also oversaw a federal policing report in [LOCATION]3 that suggested use of the military to supplement domestic police departments in times of social unrest. The creation of ORG49 was really to draw up plans for civil unrest throughout north GPE28. As [ORGANIZATION]6 wrote in [ORGANIZATION] back in [LOCATION]4 While ORG50 was established only in October [PERSON], its headquarters staff of 640 is already larger than that of ORG51, which overseas [PERSON]3 military operations throughout [LOCATION] and the LOC8. The reality is that the military brass is intensely interested in monitoring political dissent because its domestic operations will be directed not against a relative handful of Islamic fundamentalist terroristswho have not carried out a single operation inside GPE2 since [LOCATION]6 against the democratic rights of the [PERSON] people. The lone [PERSON] is now a domestic terrorist. Liberals are [STREET] out front on this designation, too. The terrorist tag opens the [STREET] to the further removal of all due process. So both a mentally ill misfit AND a domestic terrorist. Much as [ORGANIZATION]7 was an evil mastermind AND a cave dwelling primitive. If martial law comes, it wont be called martial law. It will be called [ORGANIZATION] or some other FAC0 opaque and Orwellian term. GPE29 has rather perfected this stuff, though they seem [ORGANIZATION]7 to barely care about global opinion. The climate crises plays into this, too, of course. It is useful to take the time to find the source of whatever dire warnings you are being told. Much of it has direct connections to the [PERSON] military in all its branches. [ORGANIZATION]8 even said3 the melting [PERSON] presents a great business opportunity. [LOCATION] is not an aberration or anomaly. He is the logical outcome of [LOCATION]7 of white supremacist values, arrogance, and class oppression. One need look back no further than [ORGANIZATION]9 to see the origins of much of what [LOCATION] is about. The Democrats are to the right of [LOCATION] on most of his foreign policy, and they will increasingly attack him from the right throughout [LOCATION]8. Meanwhile the last shreds of civil liberties and due process are being removed. Fear is a great distraction. Its the governments three card monte game  and liberals and democrats are completely behind anything that is labeled green or about safety. Well, the safety of white people, mostly. And that doesnt mean the homeless, of course. They are, in fact, another health and hygiene threat that needs to be dealt with. For their own good, naturally.  1 646daaa564a1  2  3"

baltimore,2020-12-10T00:00:00Z,Impact News Service,The Baltimore Sun,"homeless, homelessness, affordable housing","[PERSON] 77; Congressional Record Vol. 166, No. 208 ([ORGANIZATION])","Mr. [PERSON]. Mr. President, pursuant to [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], I move to discharge [ORGANIZATION] from further consideration of [ORGANIZATION]. [DATE], a joint resolution providing for congressional disapproval of the proposed foreign military sale to [ORGANIZATION] of certain defense articles and services. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is pending. Mr. [PERSON]. Mr. President, [PERSON] I am asking our colleagues to stand up for two very important principles. One is the congressional oversight over arms sales abroad and, secondly, to ensure that these sales, in fact, promote and protect the long-term national security of [PERSON]. Colleagues, I wish we didnt find ourselves in the position of having to discuss our concerns with this sale in this kind of forum. [ORGANIZATION] has, indeed, been an important partner in the fight against terrorism and across the region and, I believe, will continue to do so. However, a sale of this magnitude requires the appropriate due diligence. For [LOCATION], the executive branch has respected the congressional oversight of the arms sales process, a critical piece of which is an informal review period during which we get answers to pressing questions. We have an opportunity to review sensitive information so that, when sales come up for the formal notification, which is what we have before us now, we have a clearer path forward. Unfortunately, in this case, the [PERSON] administration decided to simply ignore congressional rights here and the review process, formally notifying the sales of these complex weapons systems, along with other weaponry, totaling 23 billion. Beyond obliterating the congressional review process, the administration also seems to have rushed through the interagency review of a sale of this magnitude. Whereas, a sale of this scope would normally merit [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] of detailed deliberations between ORG1 and ORG2, this sale was announced with more missing than [TIME] dotted is and crossed ts. I will go into more detail later before we vote, but the bottom line is that there are many outstanding issues that are critical to [PERSON] security that have not been addressed, including, by [STREET] of example, [ORGANIZATION] present and future military relationships with [PERSON] and [PERSON]. My understanding is that there are negotiations to have with [PERSON] regarding an airstrip for the Chinese military off of the [ORGANIZATION]. Is that in the national interest and security of [PERSON]? Should we not have a definitive commitment from the [ORGANIZATION] that it will not move forward if these arms sales move forward, including with the most sophisticated stealth jet fighter that we have? How do we work to safeguard [PERSON] technology? the guarantees we will have in [STREET] about how [PERSON] -origin weapons will be used given the [ORGANIZATION] history of transferring weapons to a terrorist organization and violating the [ORGANIZATION] arms embargo in [PERSON]? the longer term implications of an arms race in the region? and then, yes, the impact that it could have on both our and [PERSON]2s qualitative military edge? If we arent going to be willing to ask these questions, then we have to think about the magnitude of the sale without caring about the consequences. I have heard a number of my colleagues advocate in support of these sales because they believe it will help our like-minded partners better posture against [LOCATION]. Now, no one is more clear-eyed in this [LOCATION] or has pursued [LOCATION] and its threat of nuclear weapons more than I, and we are clear-eyed about the threat [LOCATION] continues to pose to national security interests, but we have yet to understand exactly what military threat the [PERSON] or armed drones will be addressing vis-a-vis [LOCATION]. Furthermore, according to the [PERSON] administration, as recently as [ORGANIZATION], the [ORGANIZATION] continued to host a number of companies that facilitated [LOCATION]ian financial transactions in violation of various [PERSON] sanctions. So [LOCATION] is a threat, but you are helping it facilitate [PERSON] financial transactions. It is not that I have said so but that the [PERSON] administration has said so. Meanwhile, over [PERSON], [LOCATION] has ramped up its nuclear capabilities amidst [PERSON]8n diplomatic fallout. So, if we really want to talk about countering [LOCATION], we need a comprehensive, diplomatic strategy. Arming partners with complex weapons systems that could take [PERSON] to come online is not a serious strategy with which to confront the very real and timely threats from [LOCATION]. I have also heard some of our colleagues argue that, if we do not sell these weapons, the [ORGANIZATION] will turn to [PERSON] and [PERSON]. Well, lets be clear They already do. They already do. Our own ORG6 inspector general recently reported that the [ORGANIZATION] may be funding the [PERSON]n mercenary ORG7 in [PERSON]. [ORGANIZATION] reporting implicates the [ORGANIZATION]s use of Chinese-manufactured drones, in violation of the [ORGANIZATION] arms embargo, also in [PERSON]. So, while I absolutely agree that we have to counter Chinese and [PERSON]n influence in the region, again, this requires a real strategy, not simply more arms. Isnt this a conversation and a commitment that we should get in writing from the [ORGANIZATION] as part of such an arms sale? We dont have that. Furthermore, if we go forward with these sales, yet deny similar requests to countries like [PERSON]0 or [PERSON]1, where will they go for their advanced weaponry to keep pace, and what reaction will [LOCATION] have to them? Do we really think we can sell this just to the [ORGANIZATION] and not have those other countries come knocking on our door, starting a very sophisticated arms race in a tinder box of the world? Finally, let me be very clear I applaud the PERSON2 accords as a historical turning point for [PERSON]2 and the Arab world. These new, formal relationships have the possibility of transforming the region much more broadly and bringing peace, stability, and prosperity to people who desperately want [PERSON] S7297 and deserve it. Yet, as the administration and the [ORGANIZATION] have continued to stress, these sales are neither a reward nor are they part of these accords. So why cant we take a little more time to really assess the best [STREET] forward? We are in the midst of promoting a sale--this is the administration--that has some of the most significant transfers of advanced [PERSON] technology without clarity of a number of key details regarding the sale or sufficient answers to critical national security questions. This is far more than about congressional prerogative, although I would argue that it is a critical element of our policies on arms sales this is about national security concerns to which we should have an answer before those arms sales move forward. Again, colleagues, the bottom line is this There are far too many outstanding questions and very serious questions about long-term [PERSON] security interests. Perhaps, after considerable engagement with the executive, we would assess that all of these sales do, in fact, advance our national security. Given the length of time it will take for the delivery of these systems, it would seem quite reasonable to expect to have [ORGANIZATION] to evaluate these questions. So I urge my colleagues to stand up for [ORGANIZATION]s role in the process of determining arms sales as well as for having clear answers to the critical questions that are posed to long-term [PERSON] security interests. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. [PERSON]. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr. [PERSON]. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. [PERSON]. Mr. President, I am on the floor [PERSON] to speak to resolutions upon which we will begin voting [PERSON] regarding arms sales proposed by the administration to [ORGANIZATION]. I am on the floor [PERSON] to ask my colleagues to support these resolutions of disapproval upon two grounds one, the protection of congressional prerogative and, two, a question of [PERSON] security. First, let me cover the question of congressional prerogative. We have traditionally debated arms sales here on occasion, and the reason why we dont have constant debates in this body on arms sales, the reason why we dont have resolutions on every sale that is noticed by the administration, is because we have built into our practice an ability for the [ORGANIZATION] to consult with the administration beforehand on a bipartisan basis. Over the [PERSON], since the passage of the law allowing for [ORGANIZATION] to have a role in the sale of arms to foreign nations, administration after administration, Republican and Democrat, has observed a period of consultation with [ORGANIZATION] in which the administration comes to [ORGANIZATION], comes to [ORGANIZATION], presents the reasons for the sale, and then addresses concerns raised, often in a bipartisan manner, by Republicans and Democrats. Again, this has happened in both Democratic and Republican administrations, with Democratic and Republican [ORGANIZATION]es, and often that consultative process results in issues that [ORGANIZATION] has being resolved so that you never have to have a vote on the [ORGANIZATION] floor. Something different happened with this sale. The administration was so desperate to rush through the sale before the end of their administration that they blew through the consultation process. It just didnt happen. There was no ability for [ORGANIZATION] to weigh in on this particular sale. It was rushed to notice, and our only option was to bring it before the full [ORGANIZATION]. Now, under any circumstances, I would argue that the [ORGANIZATION] should stand up for our right to have a role. The reason that we built in this consultative process was because the [ORGANIZATION] was actually unhappy with the amount of input it had DATE9 and was threatening to dramatically expand its oversight role on arms sales. Instead, a deal was worked out in which the administration said they would come for this consultation. Now it appears that those consultations are no longer the practice. That reduces our role as a foreign-policy-making body. And remember, we have abdicated all sorts of responsibilities over the [PERSON] when it comes to what should be a coequal responsibility to set the broad direction of [PERSON] foreign policy with the executive branch. This would be yet another chip away at [ORGANIZATION]s participation in the setting of [PERSON] security policy. I am not sure we will ever get it back. But on this sale, in particular, the consultative process was really important because this sale is as big and as hairy and as complicated as you get. We are, for the first time, selling [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] Reaper drones into the heart of [ORGANIZATION]. We have never done it before. There are only 14 countries that currently operate the F-35, and almost all of them are ORG13 allies. [PERSON]3 was on the list for a period of time, but because they ended up making a choice to go with the [PERSON]n missile defense system, they were taken out of the program. So the partners that remain are the ones that you would suspect--[PERSON]4, [PERSON]5, the [PERSON]6, [PERSON]7, GPE[LOCATION]01, [PERSON]9. There are even fewer countries that we have sold Reaper drones to-- [PERSON]7, [ORGANIZATION]0, [PERSON]5, the [PERSON]6, [ORGANIZATION]1, [ORGANIZATION]2, and [ORGANIZATION]3. This is the first time that we would sell these incredibly lethal, incredibly complicated technologies into the heart of [ORGANIZATION]-- a region that, arguably, is not in need of more weapons. What we risk doing here is fueling an arms race. [LOCATION]0 we may be selling the [PERSON] and the [ORGANIZATION] to the [ORGANIZATION], but the Saudis are going to want it, the [PERSON]0is have already requested it, and it just fuels [LOCATION]s interest in continuing to build up its own military program. But, more specifically to this sale, we have to ask ourselves whether the [ORGANIZATION] is ready for this technology or whether their behavior over the past several [PERSON] makes them an unworthy partner for this set of highly complicated [PERSON] defense technology. I will stipulate, as I think every Member of this body will, that the [ORGANIZATION] is often a very important ally of [PERSON]. There is an important cooperative relationship that exists between [PERSON] and the [ORGANIZATION]. We share counterterrorism information together. We were both involved in the fight against ORG14. We work together to counter [LOCATION]ian influence in the region. And, of course, the [ORGANIZATION]s recognition of [PERSON]2 is good for [PERSON] as well. But for as many places as we cooperate with [ORGANIZATION], there are many points of division, and those points of division often involve the use of [PERSON] military technology against the interests of [PERSON]. The [ORGANIZATION] has been, for [PERSON], involved in a civil war in GPE[LOCATION]02 that is terrible for [PERSON] security interests. They may not be as involved as they were a couple of [PERSON] ago, but they are still a barrier to peace. They still refuse to make humanitarian contributions to help the situation on the ground. So far in [LOCATION]3, there are zero dollars from the [ORGANIZATION] put into the [ORGANIZATION] appeal to try to fight off starvation and cholera inside GPE[LOCATION]02. At one point, they took [PERSON] equipment and they handed it to extremist militias inside GPE[LOCATION]02. That is open-source reporting. The [ORGANIZATION] copped to it when the reporters asked them whether they had done it. They gave our equipment to Salafist militias inside a theater of war. There are other reports that they were dropping [PERSON]8n-made [ORGANIZATION] missiles out of the sky into areas of that country that were controlled by ORG15-aligned elements. And they are, right now, as we speak, in violation of the [PERSON] arms embargo. The [ORGANIZATION] Panel of Experts came to the conclusion that the majority of arms transfers into [PERSON] to the Haftar armed forces were either from [ORGANIZATION]5 or [ORGANIZATION]. The panel found that the [ORGANIZATION] was in repeated noncompliance with the arms embargo. And guess what is on the list of the weapons that the [ORGANIZATION] was transferring into [PERSON] in violation of a [PERSON] -supported arms embargo-- armed drones. [PERSON] S7298 We are talking about selling the [ORGANIZATION] the most lethal, most advanced armed drone technology in the world [PERSON], and as we speak, the [ORGANIZATION] is in violation of the arms embargo to [PERSON], fueling that civil war, specifically sending drones into that theater. So I am not here to say that we shouldnt be in the security business with the [ORGANIZATION]. There are a lot of important common projects. But the question is, with a country that is part of the problem more often than part of the solution in GPE[LOCATION]02, a country that is in existing violation of an arms embargo in [PERSON], a country that has just within the last several [PERSON] transferred our weapons to ORG15-aligned militias, without resolving those issues, is this the moment to be selling, for the first time ever, [PERSON], armed drones into the heart of [ORGANIZATION]? One last caution. The countries that I mentioned on this list are by and large in business with [PERSON] and not with [PERSON] and [PERSON]. The [ORGANIZATION] has pretty deep and complicated defense relationships with [PERSON], [PERSON], and Chinese and [PERSON]n companies. Query whether we can be absolutely certain that the technology on board those fighter jets, those drones, is going to stay in the right hands. There arguably is no other country on the list for the [PERSON] that does as much business with [PERSON] and [PERSON] as the [ORGANIZATION] does. In fact, as I mentioned, we pulled the F-35 program from [PERSON]3 because they are involved with [PERSON] on a very complicated and important ground defense system, and we are just learning about the nature of the partnerships that the [ORGANIZATION] has with the Chinese and the [PERSON]ns. It stands to reason that this would be one of the issues that a consultative process with [ORGANIZATION] would resolve. It also stands to reason that we could probably come to a conclusion during that consultative process. If the [ORGANIZATION] really wants those weapons, wants to be the first country in the heart of [ORGANIZATION] to get the F-35 or the Reaper drones, then I assume they would want to be able to assure [ORGANIZATION] and the administration that there is no chance of technology transfer into the wrong hands. That is what the congressional consultative process would have gotten us, but it didnt happen in this case, and so we are stuck with this vote--a means for [ORGANIZATION] to stand up for its right to participate in this question of arms sales. Believe me, my Republican colleagues are going to want that right when a Democratic administration comes into office. You are not going to want to send a signal [PERSON] to the PERSON5 administration that they dont have to consult with you as the majority party, potentially, in [LOCATION]5. But if you vote against these resolutions, then you are essentially saying the PERSON5 administration doesnt need to consult with [ORGANIZATION] on it. They probably will because they want to do the right thing, but anybody who votes against these resolutions is essentially endorsing an end-around of [ORGANIZATION] by any administration, Republican or Democratic. It is also important to say that on policy grounds, it is not time to do these sales. There are too many outstanding questions about who the [ORGANIZATION] transfers weapons to, what they are doing in [PERSON], why they havent been part of the solution in GPE[LOCATION]02, and what their relationship is with some of our most important adversaries around the globe. Until we satisfy the answers to those questions, we should not move forward with this sale. Finally, there is no threat to the accords between [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]2 unwinding if we simply press pause on this sale until those questions are answered. I do want to be in business with the [ORGANIZATION]. I think they are an important defense partner. But I think there is far too much at stake with the sale of these weapons right now to rush it through, and I dont think there is any downside risk if we were to say not now until we get all of our ts crossed and all of our is dotted. [PERSON] stand up for [ORGANIZATION]s prerogative on the sale of arms to foreign countries. [PERSON] slow down this process that has been rushed, potentially to the great detriment of [PERSON] security. [PERSON] support these resolutions of disapproval [TIME]. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from [ORGANIZATION]6 Coronavirus Mrs. [PERSON]. Mr. President, I come to the floor [PERSON] to really highlight the important work that has been underway by Members on both sides of the aisle in the [ORGANIZATION] and Members on both sides of the aisle in the ORG17 to try to come up with an agreement to deliver urgently needed relief to address the challenges from the coronavirus that people are facing across this country. I also hope that we can work together to get this across the finish line and that [ORGANIZATION] leadership will be willing to join in that effort. I think most of us are painfully aware of the devastating impact this pandemic has had in communities across our [ORGANIZATION]7, but the numbers do bear repeating. More than 15 million [PERSON]8ns have been infected with the virus, more than 285,000 [PERSON]8ns have now died from [PERSON], and we recently hit a new record high of 102,000 people hospitalized with [PERSON]. Just to provide some context, our largest city in [ORGANIZATION]6 is [ORGANIZATION]8. It has 112,000 residents. So we have enough people in the hospital across this country to fill the city of [ORGANIZATION]8. The situation is dire. People need help. [PERSON]7y one of those numbers that I have referenced is much more than a number it reflects an [PERSON]8n life, an [PERSON]8n family, our communities. The human toll of this crisis is crushing, and we are up against the clock as our hospitals run out of beds. This crisis has been all-encompassing. In addition to the severe strains on our healthcare system, so many others are being battered by this pandemic. Small businesses are closing, and even more are on the verge of collapsing if we dont get them some help. Our transportation networks, from buses to airplanes, have been forced to lay off staff, cut routes, and in some cases just discontinue service altogether. [PERSON]8n families are going hungry. We have all seen the long lines on the news at [TIME] showing the number of people waiting to get food from food banks. Too many people are facing homelessness. In [ORGANIZATION]6, in the city of [ORGANIZATION]8 alone, we have 35 homeless encampments--35. Two [PERSON] ago, we did not have that number of homeless. Parents are struggling to help their children continue their education at home, sometimes with no access to broadband or really bad access. We know women are leaving the workforce because of the strains of trying to provide support to their children and deal with the other challenges of [PERSON]. ORG2 and local governments have been stretched to the maximum. In [ORGANIZATION]6, we are facing severe budgetary shortfalls, and many of our communities may have to make some difficult decisions to cut first responders or teachers or other municipal workers if they dont get help. We hear [LOCATION]7 the number of people who need our help, and they cant wait any longer. This is DATE[LOCATION]01, [LOCATION]9. We are headed into the worst [ORGANIZATION] of [DATE]. In [ORGANIZATION]6, we have restaurants that can no longer be open because they dont have outdoor seating. We have small businesses that are worried about getting through the next few [ORGANIZATION]. For [ORGANIZATION]2, we have had a group of bipartisan lawmakers in both the ORG17 and [ORGANIZATION]--so bipartisan and bicameral--who have been engaged in good-faith negotiations to get a relief package out the door as swiftly as possible. We were able to reach an agreement on a broad bipartisan framework [ORGANIZATION]3, and we have continued negotiations around-the-clock since that was announced. In [ORGANIZATION]6 and throughout this country, our small businesses have been some of the hardest hit by this pandemic. In [ORGANIZATION]6, we are a small business ORG2. They are the lifeblood of our economy. They account for 99 percent of all of our businesses and more than 50 percent of our workforce. In the country as a whole, two-thirds of our jobs are created by small businesses. In the bipartisan framework that we are negotiating, we have another round [PERSON] S7299 of [ORGANIZATION], which has been instrumental for so many of our small businesses since back in DATE[LOCATION]02 when we passed it and created the program in the CARES Act. Overall, our bipartisan relief proposal would provide significant financial assistance for our small businesses, for our restaurants, for our live venues, which in many cases have been shut down completely, and for our childcare centers. In [ORGANIZATION]6, if we dont get some help for our childcare centers, at the end of this pandemic, we will have lost fully 50 percent of our childcare centers. That means the families who depend on that childcare so that they can go to work are not going to have any safe [STREET] for their kids. I hear frequently from [ORGANIZATION]6 businesses that have used the [ORGANIZATION] program effectively to keep workers on payroll and make rent that they still need more assistance if they are going to get through [ORGANIZATION]5. Our tourism and hospitality industries are particularly hard hit, and they are vital to [ORGANIZATION]6s economy. They are our second biggest industry. Restaurants in [ORGANIZATION]6 account for nearly 70,000 jobs and for 3 billion in sales, according to the [ORGANIZATION]7al Restaurant Association. We have to provide some help for them. The future of our small businesses in [ORGANIZATION]6 and throughout the country hang in the balance. If we fail to act, we fail them. For many [PERSON]8n families, the past 9 [ORGANIZATION] have been the most difficult economic challenges of their lives, and the bleak jobs report [ORGANIZATION]3 reaffirms what we have been seeing in our communities. Nearly 10 million jobs have been lost since the start of the pandemic. That means people are out of work, struggling to put food on the table for themselves and their families, struggling to keep a roof over their heads. The eviction moratorium is about to expire. That is the story for 10 million families. In the bipartisan framework that we have been negotiating, we have urgently needed funding for additional unemployment insurance. We provide rental assistance to help not just those people who might lose their housing but also the landlords, who have been hit very hard because people havent been able to pay their rent. It also increases funding for food assistance programs to combat the surging food insecurity in our communities. We cant afford further delay in delivering these resources. The unemployment benefits are due to expire at [ORGANIZATION]7, and time is of the essence. One of the important areas of concern that this bipartisan proposal addresses is the need for ORG19 funding to help our ORG2 and our local communities. They are facing massive revenue shortfalls--at least in my home ORG2 of [ORGANIZATION]6--and that threatens their ability to provide essential services. We cant afford to lose those people who provide those services, who, if they are laid off, may be forced to go someplace else and wont be available when we have the money to rehire them. We cant afford to lose the teachers, and already we are seeing too many teachers who are retiring or leaving the profession because they are worried about safety and exposure, or they dont have the resources to be able to do the online teaching that is required now. If we dont get this funding out the door, we are going to see more of those losses. In [ORGANIZATION]6 and in our cities and towns, they are being stretched to the limits. We are at the precipice of this crisis. Cases are continuing to go up. Hospitalizations are going up. The death toll is going up. People need help, and they need it now. In [ORGANIZATION]6, our nursing homes have been especially devastated by this crisis. We have the highest percentage of [PERSON] deaths in our long-term care facilities of any ORG2 in the country. Eighty-one percent of our death toll has been tied to nursing homes. Our bipartisan relief framework includes necessary ORG19 support for [ORGANIZATION], and it allocates urgently needed help for our nursing homes that are on the frontlines. We also provide help to address substance use disorders and mental health. What we have seen across the country is that [PERSON]-19 has exacerbated what already existed in the opioid epidemic. We were beginning to make some progress in [ORGANIZATION]6 and in many [DATE] across the country until the coronavirus hit, and now we are seeing that progress being lost. Our plan bolsters support for ORG19 investments in a number of programs that respond to the substance use disorder crisis in our communities, and it also addresses suicide prevention. This pandemic has created significant burdens for those who are struggling with substance use disorders. And, of course, we have heard the number of mental health issues has been greatly exacerbated. Our bipartisan plan addresses three of the most important pieces of the strategy to get on the other side of this pandemic testing, tracing, and vaccine distribution. As overwhelming as this crisis has become, we cant just throw our hands in the air. We have to continue to prioritize robust testing and contact tracing so we can track and contain community spread. Of course, we need to follow the ORG21 guidelines--wearing masks, maintaining social distancing, staying home as much as possible, hand washing--so that we can help flatten the curve and help our hospitals. And now, as we are, we hope, [ORGANIZATION]8 away from having a vaccine, we need to ensure that every measure is taken so we are ready to go on [ORGANIZATION]9. The manufacturing and distribution of a safe and effective [PERSON]-19 vaccine are critical to putting an end to this pandemic, to reopening our economy, and to restoring normalcy in our society. Our [PERSON] framework boosts funding for each of these three priorities. When the [ORGANIZATION] came together during [ORGANIZATION]0 of this crisis, we worked in good faith to deliver the CARES Act that provided relief to [PERSON]8ns throughout the country. We did it before, and I believe we can do it again. This bipartisan framework is the only bipartisan measure in [ORGANIZATION]. It is the only bicameral measure in [ORGANIZATION]. It is the only proposal that has an opportunity to clear both [LOCATION]. We arent done, obviously. Negotiations are ongoing. There are a lot more people who have to see this work and, hopefully, will decide to support it, and we still have more concerns to sort out. But this is a compromise. It doesnt have everything I want to see. It is not what I would have written if I had been able to write it by myself, but it is a compromise that I believe we can get majority support to pass. Of course, it is step one. It is a relief bill to help [PERSON]8ns stay afloat over these next very difficult [ORGANIZATION], and our work doesnt end if we can provide this relief. We are still going to need a stimulus bill to get our economy moving again. But, right now, the most urgent need is to address those concerns that individuals and families have. If [ORGANIZATION] fails to act and get this over the finish line, the consequences will be dire. Our hospitals are already overwhelmed. Too many small businesses are closing. Families are going hungry and facing homelessness. Inaction is really not an option. We need to get this done. There is no reason we cant come to an agreement. We have done it before. I urge Senators on both sides of the aisle to join in this effort. I urge Leader [PERSON] and Leader [PERSON] to move forward with us to help us get this proposal over the line so that together we can deliver much needed relief to [PERSON]8ns and do it before DATE[LOCATION]01 so that people will have something to look forward to. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr. [PERSON]. The Senator from [PERSON]1 Tribute to [PERSON]0 Mr. [PERSON]1. Mr. President, I would like to speak for [TIME] moments [PERSON] about a [PERSON]2 and [PERSON]1 rock star. I am talking about [PERSON]2s own [PERSON]0. [ORGANIZATION]2, [PERSON]2 announced that she is going to retire from her post as a weather forecaster at ORG23, which we refer to as ORG[LOCATION]02, where she has served on ORG25 and on Early Edition for many [PERSON]. [PERSON]2 is known--widely known--affectionately as [PERSON] has been reporting the weather for the people of [PERSON]1, particularly Southeast [PERSON]1, for 37 [PERSON]--37 [PERSON]--and all [PERSON] S7300 at the same station. Over a ORG26 career spanning, what, [ORGANIZATION]5, [PERSON]2 has become a beloved fixture in our ORG2 and in our ORG2 capital. Her compassion has been on regular display--and not only in the [STREET] that she has walked Louisianians through hurricanes and tornadoes. [PERSON] is important to us in [PERSON]1. [PERSON]2 has invested in first and second graders at FAC0 in East [PERSON]2 Parish through an extraordinary program called the ORG27 program. She has built new homes for families through [LOCATION], where she currently serves as a board member. [PERSON]2 has been a part of ORG29 pet therapy program. That is a program where she and her colleagues visit young patients and their families at one of our leading hospitals, [ORGANIZATION]0. [PERSON]2s awards are many. I wont list them all, but they include the [PERSON]1 Association of Broadcasters Lifetime Achievement Award, [ORGANIZATION] of the Year Award--that was from [ORGANIZATION]1--and the Ulli Goodman Volunteer of the Year Award from the [PERSON]2 Ballet Theater. I dont know how she finds the time, but [PERSON]2 is also certified as a [ORGANIZATION]3 Pet Partner for her work using therapy animals. Yet I noticed that [PERSON]2s announcement was characteristically humble as she steps away after 37 [PERSON]. Here is what she said I have never taken for granted the honor and privilege you have given me over these many [PERSON] by choosing me and my colleagues here at ORG23 to keep you and your family safe and informed. I think that the gratitude among [PERSON]1 and [PERSON]2 residents is certainly mutual. I am glad to hear that [PERSON]2 will not be leaving our great ORG2. I want to emphasize that. She is going to retire in [PERSON]1, and I hope she enjoys every moment--every single moment--she gets to sleep in after [ORGANIZATION]8. No one can argue--no fair-minded person can argue-- that she hasnt earned a rest, even though her familiar weather forecast will be sorely missed in a ORG2 that takes more than our fair share of beatings from Mother Nature. I thank you for the chance to honor [PERSON]0. I thank you for the chance to honor [PERSON]0 for all of her hard work on behalf of everyone who relies on ORG23 for news and for everyone in [PERSON]1 and [PERSON]2 whom her volunteer work has touched--and that numbers in the hundreds of thousands. [PERSON]2, may the [PERSON] ahead bring as much joy to you as you have brought to our ORG2 and our community. [PERSON]4 bless you. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from [PERSON]5 [ORGANIZATION]7al Defense Authorization Act Mr. [PERSON]5. Mr. President, for many [PERSON], I have supported the [PERSON]0 [ORGANIZATION]7al Defense Authorization Act. The bill always contains many worthy provisions, and it usually passes with large majorities. After all, who wants to vote no when the common refrain to pass the bill is Support the troops? But at some point you have to draw the line, and [PERSON]1 is where I draw it. Just look at these bills over the last few [PERSON]. Five [PERSON] ago, the [ORGANIZATION]4 was 968 pages--not unusual around here and something you can get your hands around. But [ORGANIZATION], the [ORGANIZATION]4 report was 1,794 pages, and [PERSON]1 the report is an astonishing 4,517 pages--not even counting the classified annexes. I doubt anyone really knows what is in it except maybe some lobbyists. And get this As the bill grew more than sixfold in length, we had even less time to read it. The number of people who could read the bill at any one time was restricted. Social distancing--Cant have too many people in the room, we were told. That is fine. I understand. We are still in a pandemic. But then we should have had more time to review the bill, not less. Yet [ORGANIZATION]5 members were asked on this floor [ORGANIZATION]3 to sign the bill after having only a couple of hours to review it. As this massive bill was written in secret and then rushed to a vote, some seem to have forgotten to consult with the Commander in Chief or recall that he has veto power. It is pretty well known that the President wants the bill to reform or repeal section 230, the giveaway to [ORGANIZATION] oligarchs who get to censor the [PERSON]8n people without consequence. The bill stiff-arms the President. There is not a word in more than 4,500 pages about section 230. The sponsors claim they couldnt airdrop provisions into the bill at [TIME]. I take the point. I am not sure the President will, though, and he is the one with the veto. But there is more. The bill condemns the President for proposing to move some troops out of [PERSON]6 and restricts his ability to do so, even though ORG13s frontier has shifted hundreds of miles to the east and [PERSON]6 hasnt exactly carried its share of the ORG13 load. The [ORGANIZATION] didnt debate this major policy change. Our earlier bill didnt even mention it. As far as I am concerned, this provision was, to borrow a phrase, airdropped without appropriate consultation with committee members. And for the record, I am a senior member of the committee, but I only learned about this provision in the newspaper on [PERSON]4, [PERSON]5 after I was asked to sign the bill. It would appear the standard for airdropping provisions into the bill is that we wont airdrop things that support the Presidents priorities, but we will airdrop stuff that thwarts his priorities. I doubt that will get past the Presidents veto either. This failure to consult committee members is not an isolated incident. The Presidents 5G plan released valuable but unused spectrum owned by the government. The [ORGANIZATION]7 protested mightily but only with vague evidence. We had a hearing on this issue, and it sharply divided committee members. Yet, again, this bill disrupts the Presidents plan, and, again, we learned about it only after the fact. Another thing that happens behind closed doors is broken promises. We were promised [PERSON]6 that the radical [PERSON]6 amendment wouldnt survive the conference committee. Not only did it survive not a single word was changed. You may have heard about the [PERSON]6 amendment. You probably heard that it would merely rename some [ORGANIZATION]8 bases that are named after [ORGANIZATION] officers. There is no harm in having that debate. I have always found it curious that we dont have a base named after say [PERSON] [PERSON]9 or PERSON[LOCATION]01. Yet the [PERSON]6 amendment is far more radical than merely renaming [TIME] bases. The amendment explicitly applies to all military property. That is a lot more than bases. It includes military museums, service academies, and cemeteries. Do you think I am exaggerating? I am not. Read the bill no exceptions for museums, for academies, even for cemeteries. Let me give you just one example. The FAC1 library contains portraits of [PERSON]9 and PERSON20 in close proximity, two commanders of the Civil War, juxtaposed as [PERSON]s cadets learn the history of our [ORGANIZATION]7, our [ORGANIZATION]8, and their own school. But that painting may have to come down. So I suppose [PERSON]8 cadets may learn that [PERSON]9 defeated an unnamed enemy with an unnamed commander and accepted surrender from no one at FAC2. But if you really want to see the radical consequence of the [PERSON]6 amendment, just look across the river to [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]7al Cemetery, our [ORGANIZATION]7s most sacred ground. Those gardens of stone stretch in symmetrical rows across the horizon, except for a single odd section laid out in circles, rather than rows, and with pointed headstones, rather than rounded ones. The 482 graves in Section 16 contain the remains of [PERSON]8ns who rebelled against our country. That section also contains a memorial to those who died in that rebellion. We should be grateful that those rebels and their cause lost on the battlefield. Yet we should also be mindful of the historical context of this patch of our most sacred ground. Section 16 of [PERSON] was created as a symbol not of secession but of reconciliation by the very men who had fought for the [LOCATION]0. President PERSON21--a decorated veteran of the [LOCATION]0 [ORGANIZATION]8, promoted three times for battlefield valor--oversaw its creation. In a display of magnanimity, he declared--in [PERSON] S7301 front of the [PERSON]7 legislature, of all places--that [ORGANIZATION] would assume responsibility for [ORGANIZATION] graves. He then signed a bill authorizing the reinterment of [ORGANIZATION] soldiers at [PERSON]. Senator [PERSON]6 apparently believes that she knows better how to handle the legacy of our Civil War than did the [LOCATION]0 veterans who bled and defeated the [LOCATION]3 on the field of battle, or even PERSON22, who continued a longstanding [ORGANIZATION] tradition in [PERSON]9 of sending a wreath to the [ORGANIZATION] section of [PERSON] on [PERSON]0. If the professor gets her [STREET], a crane may [STREET] into [PERSON] and rip out the memorial whose history dates back to President PERSON23 and which was honored just [TIME] [PERSON] ago by President PERSON[LOCATION]02. Again, I am not exaggerating. In the committee markup, Senator [PERSON]6 said that is exactly what she wants to happen. And if that happens, maybe the professor will be applauded in faculty lounges, but my perspective is a little different. I served at [PERSON] with [LOCATION]4. My soldiers and I laid to rest our [ORGANIZATION]7s heroes. A lot of those funerals started in Section 16. Before those funerals started, we talked sometimes about that odd section and the war that occasioned it. After all, the [ORGANIZATION]8 has a lot of amateur Civil War historians. We were proud to wear the uniform of and be the heirs to [PERSON]9 and PERSON25 and PERSON26--the great warriors who saved the [LOCATION]0 and vindicated freedom and equality for all. We also had a little humility. We didnt presume that we knew better than [PERSON]9 and PERSON23 how to heal our [ORGANIZATION]7s wounds after the Civil War, or that we knew better than [PERSON], who called for malice toward none, with charity for all. [LOCATION]28be Senator [PERSON]6 and the [PERSON] in our streets repudiate the wisdom of [PERSON] and [PERSON]9 and PERSON23. Perhaps they think [PERSON] should be canceled. A mob tried to tear down his statue just [TIME] blocks from here [PERSON]6. Too many of these [PERSON] condemn our [ORGANIZATION]7 as racist to its core. They look at the [LOCATION]3 and see not a rebellion against [PERSON]8 but the true heart of [PERSON]8. So, naturally, their iconoclasm doesnt stop with tearing down statues of PERSON20 but moves right away to statues of PERSON29, [PERSON], and [PERSON]9. They tried to tear down those [PERSON]6, too, if you recall. I will never stand by while [PERSON] tear down statues of PERSON29, [PERSON], and [PERSON]9, nor will I support a bill that permits a crane to [STREET] into [PERSON] and desecrate that sacred ground. We celebrate the triumph of the [LOCATION]0 and the cause of freedom and equality and the defeat of the [LOCATION]3, but why does it follow that we have to rip paintings off the walls of libraries and museums and tear down war memorials in [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]7al Cemetery? And I suspect a lot of other Senators wouldnt support this bill either if they knew what it does. And that takes me back to a larger problem. We were promised this radical language wouldnt be part of the final bill, but that promise was discarded behind closed doors. Now, we have a 4,500-page bill at [TIME] in the rush to fund the government and pass another coronavirus relief bill before [PERSON]2, all with the [ORGANIZATION] veto hanging over it. An overlong bill negotiated behind closed doors, dropped at [TIME], major policy shifts without consensus or even much debate, broken promises, wishful thinking about a veto threat--these are the hallmarks of an [ORGANIZATION]4 process that has deteriorated rapidly in recent [PERSON]. That has to change. If it doesnt change [PERSON]4, mark my words, it will change [PERSON]5. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. [PERSON]0. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Tribute to [PERSON]1 Mr. [PERSON]0. Mr. President, sadly, I return to the floor [PERSON] to say farewell to another Member who will conclude his time in the [ORGANIZATION] at the end of the term, the junior Senator from [PERSON]9, [PERSON]1. We all know [PERSON]2 came to the [ORGANIZATION] as a storied courtroom lawyer and [PERSON] attorney, but fewer people know about his more humble origins. [PERSON]2 was born and raised in [PERSON]0, [PERSON]1, just outside of [PERSON]2, the son of a steelworker, the grandson of a coal miner. When he was 19 [PERSON] old, he spent his [PERSON]7 working at the local cotton tie mill, [TIME] a DATE[DATE], [PERSON]8 a week. [PERSON]9, a freak accident sent a bit of shrapnel flying his [STREET], and he came within inches of losing an eye. Several stitches later, [PERSON]2 went right back to work--early evidence of a stubborn streak. Only at the end of the [PERSON]7 did [PERSON]2 decide it was time to focus a bit more on his studies. That same work ethic--the sometimes stubborn work ethic--followed him his entire life. He brought it next to law school. On the one occasion [PERSON]2 decided to skip class, it wasnt to throw a pigskin around the quad or engage in some extracurricular activity with friends. No, [PERSON]2 skipped class to attend the trial of the [PERSON]3 ringleader of the [ORGANIZATION]0 bombing of FAC5, a tragedy that had shaken the conscience of a nation. A young [PERSON]1 was moved by the disposition of justice in that trial, but he was left with the impression that other members of the conspiracy had escaped the reach of the law. Only a scriptwriter could have imagined that [LOCATION]02 [PERSON] later, that law school truant would become the [PERSON] attorney in [PERSON]9 and that his office would uncover the evidence to bring charges against two more [LOCATION]5 members involved in the bombing, and that 40 [PERSON] after that awful crime, [PERSON]1 would win the conviction of the remaining conspirators, delivering a long-delayed yet righteous justice. History would repeat itself [TIME] [PERSON] later, when [PERSON]2 would again find himself at the center of events. [PERSON]2 was eating breakfast one DATE[DATE] just blocks away from the scene of the bombing of [LOCATION]6. He took charge [ORGANIZATION]4 and made sure that investigators and first responders worked together in perfect unison. [PERSON]2 would later go on to secure the indictment of [PERSON]4, the perpetrator of that heinous bombing, as well as the [ORGANIZATION] bombing 2 [PERSON] later. Of course, not every one of [PERSON]2s cases involved matters of life and death. The [PERSON] attorneys office once prosecuted local officials for trying to steal an election by bribing absentee voters with cash, beer, and a little liquor for good measure. Now, if only the defendants had known about [PERSON]2s affinity for bourbon. Kidding aside, kidding aside, those [PERSON] revealed for [PERSON]2 something profound about public service and government You can have the best laws in the world in principle, but it takes dedicated effort to make the law work for everyone in practice, to take our ideals of justice and equality and fairness and opportunity and make them real in the everyDATE[DATE] lives of citizens. [PERSON]2 brought that revelation with him to this [LOCATION]. He worked with his trademark determination to finally repeal the widows tax. He helped pass legislation to permanently fund historically Black colleges and universities. He has worked across the aisle to combat veteran suicide, strengthen the [LOCATION]7, and support our military bases--so important to the great ORG2 of [PERSON]9. Not every issue would be so easy or so bipartisan, especially for a new Senator facing a difficult reelection, but every time [PERSON]2 approached a politically sensitive vote--and I marveled at this--he was untroubled. He would do what he always did He would act on principle. He would vote his conscience--politics be damned. President [PERSON]6 had a phrase for Senators whose abiding loyalty to their conscience triumphed over all personal and political considerations. He called them profiles in courage. [PERSON]1 is a profile in courage for our times. But before I get carried away with too many grand compliments, it is important to remind colleagues that [PERSON]1, as a human being, is just a joy to be around. Just ask his good friend, the Senator from [PERSON]3. More than once [PERSON]2 would catch Senator [PERSON]7 giving an impassioned [PERSON] S7302 speech on the floor and think to himself I will bet you he didnt turn his phone off. Let me give him a ring and see what happens. Laughter. Just look at [PERSON]2s office, festooned with memorabilia of every particular [LOCATION]8 footballs and keepsakes from his favorite bands. You can go see his rocking chair--one of those southern-[LOCATION], sweet-tea-drinking chairs--and baseballs signed by Presidents, statesmen, and most impressively to this [ORGANIZATION] fan, [PERSON]8. If [PERSON]1 has one hobby besides hunting, it is autograph hunting. He has managed to collect a signature on a baseball from every Senator in this [LOCATION] [PERSON], including its newest Member. The junior Senator from [PERSON]4 was sworn in [ORGANIZATION]7, but [TIME] after he lifted his hand from that Bible, there was [PERSON]2 to congratulate him, furnishing a clean baseball, ready for Mr. [PERSON]9. That is [PERSON]1--someone who never let the immense pressure of this job change who he is, someone who has made life a joy for everyone in our caucus, and someone who understands that, at the end of [PERSON]6, we get sent to this [LOCATION] to make life better for our constituents, to do it courageously even when the odds are not in our favor. I will end with one final story. Several [PERSON] ago, [PERSON]2 was asked to participate in a stage adaptation of his favorite work of fiction, To Kill a Mockingbird, which, of course, includes his literary icon, another great [PERSON]9 lawyer, [PERSON]0. Hearing [PERSON]2s life story, you would be forgiven for thinking it was ripped from the pages of that [PERSON] PERSON20 classic, so perhaps it was fate that one DATE[DATE] [PERSON]2 would be asked to play a part in that story. There was just one hiccup [PERSON]2 was asked to play the judge. So he never got to deliver that passage, shortly after the death of Mrs. [PERSON]2, when [PERSON]3 explains to his son that real courage is not a man with a gun in his hand real courage is when you know youre licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and see it through no matter what. You rarely win, but sometimes--sometimes--you do. [PERSON]2 spent his time in the [ORGANIZATION]--indeed, his whole life--embodying the courage that [PERSON]3 describes. The story of the [ORGANIZATION] bombings is a reminder of the fact that even against tremendous evil and seemingly impossible odds, if you are dogged and determined and see it through no matter what, sometimes you do win and justice prevails. So while [PERSON]2 didnt get to play [PERSON]0 [ORGANIZATION]9 at [LOCATION]9 in [PERSON]2, that is OK. It was already the role of his lifetime. [PERSON]2 has said that it is the greatest honor of his life to fill the seat of his mentor, Senator [PERSON]4. [PERSON]2, you upheld the honor of that seat, and you have set an example for every Senator who will follow in it. Whatever the next chapter of your life may bring, the entire [ORGANIZATION] Democratic family wishes you and your family the very, very best and politely requests that you do not call us when we are in the middle of giving a speech. Laughter. I yield to my friend, the very distinguished and wonderful, wonderful, wonderful junior Senator from the great ORG2 of [PERSON]9. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from [PERSON]9 Farewell to the [ORGANIZATION] Mr. [PERSON]5. Mr. President, I thank the minority leader for those remarks. I am humbled. You know, everyone knows the old saying My, how time flies when you are having fun. My time here has drawn to a close, but despite the difficulties, the challenges, despite the rancor that we often see in this body, as well as PERSON29, [PERSON]5, I can honestly say I have had a lot of fun. [PERSON]0 3 [PERSON] have been amazing, and I have loved being a Member of this body. I actually was able to accomplish [TIME] things, thanks to you. But you have been fun you have not just been kind. It has really been good. By the [STREET], your staffs have been awesome. I know you hear that a lot from constituents. [LOCATION]28be you dont hear it enough from other Senators. Your staffs have been amazing to us, and I really very much appreciate it. You know, as the minority leader said, everybody knows I am a baseball fan. If you go into that office, you will see in my reception area all 100 baseballs that I had signed. And it was fun getting them-- either here on the floor or in a committee room, at the retreat that the Democrats had. There were so many who had never signed a baseball, and you figured out that it wasnt easy to sign a baseball. Laughter. And even those who signed in their office, when we sent them to their office, they always came up and talked about it. It was a time to put politics aside and just talk a little bit--something we really dont do enough of around here, leaving the weighty politics and responsibilities that we have just to sign a baseball and talk about how much fun it was. I remember, right after I was elected, I was talking to a friend of mine, dreaming big about the things that we could accomplish that would make a difference in the lives of the people of [PERSON]9 and the people of [PERSON]8. We talked about the possibility that we could work on a bill as important as the Civil Rights Act of [PERSON]2 or the Voting Rights Act of [PERSON]3. But I knew--I knew, though--that such opportunities were not likely, especially in what I knew to be a [PERSON]4 window and not knowing what the future would hold--although, I have got to be honest, I had a pretty doggone good idea when I got here. If there was one thing my momma always taught me, it was to be realistic about things. I knew it was going to be tough, but to even have an opportunity to talk and work on things that bring such transformational changes--those kind of things come along once in a generation, if we are lucky. They are that legislative equivalent of a perfect game in baseball. You are lucky if you get to be part of that in your career, but you always have to hope and you have to strive for the possible, not just the likely. For those of you who really dont know about baseball--there may be [TIME]--a perfect game is just that nine innings, three outs, three up, three down. [PERSON]7ything has to work together in synchrony. It is not just the pitcher who throws balls and strikes it is the outfielder who catches the fly it is the second baseman who has to get the out and throw the runner out at first. [PERSON]7yone has to fall in line and work together as a team--as a team. And it is not just that it is the people on the field. They are all working and they are all striving for the same goal. As it turned out, I didnt get a chance to be part of a perfect game. I didnt think I would, but I didnt get that chance. Sometimes I worry, as many of you do--especially if you listened to the farewell speeches of [PERSON]6 and [PERSON]7 and [PERSON]8 and others--you worry if those perfect games can ever be had in this [ORGANIZATION] again. I worry about that. But we always come close, and I came close. Right after I got here, I got invited to be part of [TIME], which I had to explain to people in [PERSON]9 that that is really not an oxymoron, that there is common sense up here. But within [PERSON]5 of being up here, I was at [PERSON]9 office with so many here--some 20 Senators, Republican, Democratic--talking about immigration, working on immigration reform. It was the hottest topic of [PERSON]6, an important topic that is still important [PERSON]. I just marveled at the fact that here I was, [PERSON]5 into this, and I was in that room being a part of those discussions. What was even more astonishing to me is that people actually wanted to hear what I had to say. That didnt happen, having raised three children, been married. I dont always get that, when people want to know what you have got to say. But they did, and I was so gratified, and I was so honored. We would meet in Senator [PERSON] office. We would meet in hideaways. It was exciting. And we came so close. You all remember that? We came so close, within about three votes of doing what they said couldnt be done, of doing something that was possible but not probable. That sense, what I saw of my colleagues, is why we ran for the [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON] S7303 I could see it. I could feel it in those rooms, in those discussions. I could see it on the floor [ORGANIZATION]4 as people were voting. It is why we wanted to be in this body. I remember sitting in the cloakroom, and I was as disappointed as ever when we failed. And for a long time, probably still to this DATE[DATE], when I am asked What is your most disappointing DATE[DATE] in the [ORGANIZATION]? I will always talk about that vote that failed so close, which was so important. But what it did demonstrate is, through that effort-- effort--that anything is possible. You have got to come close sometimes before you get across the finish line. You have got to play in the red zone a little bit before you get the touchdown. You have got to hit that line. But whatever we did, it is possible. The [ORGANIZATION] is capable of great things, if we do them, of bridging divides that society may view as too wide to cross. We can do that. It is not that wide between here and there. It is not that wide, and people need to know it and respect it. I am not the first and I certainly will not be the last to talk about the importance of bringing people together who hold opposing views and working toward what is both possible and palatable. But all too often the desire to do that kind of gets lost among other actions that dont quite match the words that we say. I noticed the other DATE[DATE] how many heads were nodding in the farewell speech of Senator PERSON51, Senator [PERSON], and Senator [PERSON]. And then what happens? I have looked at a lot of farewell speeches in [PERSON]9. They all say a lot of the same things, and everybody, I am sure, nods. We have got to do better. You have to do better. I dont think I fully appreciated it. And I listened to the minority leader talk about where I come from in [PERSON]0, but I dont think I fully appreciated it until fairly recently. It seems like I just kind of love a lost cause. It seems like every time that there is something that needs me there, I am there--fighting for justice for others, for others who feel like hope is lost, from the church bombing case to a [ORGANIZATION] election in [PERSON]9. I fought for those causes because I believe in hope. I believe in redemption. I believe in the possibility. Some may call that naive, and many have, but I have not been afraid to touch on the so-called third rail issues of our political system because I believe that, right now especially, there is no time for caution. My first speech on the [ORGANIZATION] floor was about gun violence. No one could believe a Senator from [PERSON]9 actually talked about how we can stop gun violence in a [STREET] that made some sense--not from an extreme view on the right or an extreme view on the left but right there in ways that made sense. It was a topic that I knew could have easily been twisted into a negative campaign ad--which, by the [STREET], it was. Laughter. We saw it coming. But I also knew action was so important. We took some small steps on that issue over the last 3 [PERSON], despite a lot of political pressure to the contrary, and I hope you will do more in the [PERSON] ahead because lives will depend on it. [PERSON]7ything doesnt have to be a perfect game. There is great satisfaction in [PERSON]6-to-DATE[DATE] triumphs. You can and we did hit a home run or two and more than our share of singles and doubles. I am really proud of the 20-plus bills that I led or co-led, bipartisan bills, that have been signed into law over the last 3 [PERSON]. None would have been possible without bipartisan work. One of my first original bills, the Civil Rights Cold Case [DATE]s Collection Act would never have become law without the commitment of Senator [PERSON] to help bring long-overdue closure to the victims of those terrible crimes. I see PERSON55 in the back. I appreciate Senator [PERSON]s involvement in that. I will have to say, it was so much fun, after we got that done, to go back home and tell that to all my Democratic friends. What is your proudest? I said Well, the proudest moment right now is with my partner, PERSON55 [PERSON]. They said Aha. But it shows what is possible, folks. And it was an important bill. None of those bills have meant more to me, though, than the bipartisan effort that I led with Senator [PERSON] to eliminate the military widows tax that for DATE81 had deprived widows of full survivors benefits that they deserved. So many of you went to bat for that bill Senator [PERSON], Senator PERSON58, and others. You were getting a lot of pressure, not from me or [PERSON]9. You were getting pressure from a lot of those military widows. They had been up here for 20 [PERSON], and for 20 [PERSON] the dollars and cents had prevented that from becoming a reality. We fought on that because we knew what we were doing was right. We knew it was right that you could not put a price on the duty we owe to the men and women of our armed services and their families. I will never forget [ORGANIZATION]4 in [LOCATION] when we passed the [ORGANIZATION]4 that included the elimination of the widows tax. In the FAC8, there was a large group of [ORGANIZATION] widows who had been up here for 20-plus [PERSON] to try to get that done, never being able to reach the goal. And on [ORGANIZATION]4, we did it. You did it. PERSON59 and I got a lot of credit, but it was this body, with the help of some folks in the ORG17, that made it happen. That was just one of the memorable DATE[DATE]s on the floor. Swearing-in DATE[DATE] was unbelievable--simply an explosion of emotions. To walk on the floor as a [PERSON] Senator, some 37 [PERSON] after I left the floor with my old boss as a young staffer to my mentor [PERSON]4, and to take the oath of office for his seat was just really a remarkable [STREET] of life. There are two especially significant things about [ORGANIZATION]4 too. One is that I hope that you all recognize by now that the freshman class of DATE87 will likely go down in history as one of the greatest freshman classes ever. The team of [PERSON]0 and [PERSON]1 cant be beat. It is as [PERSON]8n as apple pie. I was really proud and honored to be there with [PERSON] [PERSON]0 [ORGANIZATION]4. I was also honored, if you recall, that there were three Vice Presidents on the floor of the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]4. Now President-Elect [PERSON] escorted me in. Former Vice President [PERSON]4 escorted Senator [PERSON]0. [PERSON]5, the current Vice President, swore us in. And, actually, if you now think about it, we had a fourth--soon-to-be Vice President [PERSON]6. That is a pretty remarkable time--pretty remarkable. It was also a remarkable DATE[DATE] when what I hope is going to be a new tradition in the [ORGANIZATION] took [STREET] When we had on two different occasions, once [PERSON], six Senators--three Democrats and three Republicans--reading Dr. [PERSON] from a [PERSON]2 Jail. That document remains one of the most significant in [PERSON]8n history, and it is as important [PERSON] as it was when it was written in [ORGANIZATION]0--and, in some ways, maybe more important for the moment we find ourselves in. I have asked--and I know he will do this--my colleague Senator [PERSON]7 to carry on that tradition in my absence. And then there was [PERSON]6 of the swearing-in in [DATE]. I was here to observe, to pay my respects to all those who were returning and for those who were joining. And as I was standing in the back by the cloakroom, Senator [PERSON]7 walks up and says [PERSON]1, what are you doing? You cant get anything past [PERSON]7. There were probably [TIME] profanities ladened in there as well, if you know Senator [PERSON]7. I said Well, [PERSON]8, what do you think I am doing--with probably a couple of other kind of milder profanities. He said Look, [PERSON]9 is caught in a snowstorm back home and cant make it here, and I would like for you to escort me down when I take the oath. As it turns out, it is likely to be the only time I get to do that-- and it was a true honor, my friend. Simply sitting at this desk is perhaps the greatest thing, taking this [STREET] in and watching each of you, noting the bipartisanship, especially as we close the [ORGANIZATION]--especially as we close this [ORGANIZATION]--and how Senators move freely from one side of the aisle to the other. Occasionally, I will tell you, I confess, that I just come back here by myself, and I will open this drawer and will read the names of the Senators who sat here John [PERSON]6, [PERSON]1, [PERSON]2, my colleague Senator [PERSON]3, and so many others. And it is just overwhelming. [PERSON] S7304 You know, growing up, it was always the Presidents or [ORGANIZATION] candidates who captured my attention. I knew the names of some Senators, but that began to change for me watching the [ORGANIZATION] Select Committee on Watergate when I was in college. It was a remarkable time and a remarkable committee. And then everything changed again in DATE91 while I was studying for the bar and got a phone call from Senator [PERSON]4 chief of staff, [PERSON]6 ORG17. I had campaigned for the judge. [PERSON]6 offered me a DATE92 position on [PERSON]4 ORG52 subcommittee, which I eagerly took. DATE93 not only changed my life but brought about a respect for this body, for the [ORGANIZATION]--as an institution, as individuals, and for so many of its Members--that I had never had before. From that point on, folks, I was hooked. I was hooked on this body--before being elected to the [ORGANIZATION]. And now I have come to love the [ORGANIZATION] a lot and, importantly, all of the possibilities that go with it, which is why I dont really want to spend my last moments on the floor talking about what I have done. I want to talk about what needs to be done, what can be done, what is possible. You know, even back in [PERSON], people said it was just not possible to elect a Democrat from [PERSON]9 to the [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]--and here I have been. It is possible to make affordable quality healthcare a reality for all [PERSON]8ns. The [ORGANIZATION] right now is the best hope and only plan that is out there. As President PERSON[LOCATION]02 said--and everybody should do this--if there is a better plan you can come up with, put it out there. [PERSON] do it. I will publicly support it. The goal is healthcare for everyone in some [STREET]. There are so many in this country and in my ORG2 of [PERSON]9 who desperately need it-- before, during, and after this [PERSON] crisis. It is possible to give people in remote and rural areas access to healthcare, but it is going to take a lot of work, and it is going to take getting out of partisan corners. It is possible to provide a quality education to every [PERSON]8n child. I know education is often funded locally, but it is possible to do it. You just have to roll up your shirt sleeves and get it done. It is possible to extend broadband--access to broadband--to all [PERSON]8ns and bring every man, woman, and child into DATE95, just like we did--the [ORGANIZATION] did--with PERSON[DATE] in the Rural Electrification Act in DATE96. [LOCATION] is the new power. It is possible to do that. High speed and affordable, that is key-- affordable broadband. It is possible to ease the burdens on working-class [PERSON]8ns by setting a minimum wage that is not going to hamstring businesses but will raise the quality of living for so many in this country. So many in my ORG2 are in poverty, but yet they work. They work. They work hard, but yet they are still below that poverty level. We need to do what we can to lift them out of that poverty. It takes a lot of work. It takes hard work. It is possible for law enforcement to serve and protect all [PERSON]8ns--not just some--to root out the systemic racism that exists within law enforcement by enlisting the support of both law enforcement and the communities. It is possible. I will candidly tell you another great disappointment was when we let that moment pass this [PERSON]7--hoping that with a new President, maybe a new [ORGANIZATION], maybe a new [ORGANIZATION], we could get something accomplished. I hope that that still happens, but I was disappointed we let that moment pass this [PERSON]7 when all of the country and all of the world was behind us to say Please do something. Please do something that we have known about for DATE98, for DATE99. Please do something. Law enforcement said [PERSON] do something. We let it pass. But it is never too late to do the right thing. It is never too late for justice. It is possible to ensure that every eligible voter is able to cast a ballot and have it counted. Now is the most important opportunity we have seen in [LOCATION]3--concerns about our election process that it might have been stolen that there might have been fraud. Use that opportunity to say [PERSON] dont let these allegations have any credence going forward. [PERSON] get together. The technology is there. Figure out a [STREET] that together we can make our election safe and secure and that all people will have access to the ballot box--all people who are eligible to vote in this country. It is possible for our system of justice to treat all [PERSON]8ns equally--not just talk about it, but to do it. It is what I have tried to do throughout my career. It is possible. And this is going to be a challenge. It is possible to restore the [PERSON]8n peoples faith in government. And we all know right now that that faith has been shaken for many, many reasons. The faith has been shaken, but it is possible to restore it. It is possible for each of us to learn--as [PERSON]0 taught us--to see things from another persons point of view, to walk around in their skin or in their shoes, to see things from others point of view, to find that common ground. It is possible for us to realize that deep down that progress is not a zero-sum game, that a rising tide lifts all boats. These things are not easy. They take dedication and hard choices, but they are worthy goals. I know many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are dedicated to the same goals, and though I wont be able to cosponsor anything with you from this point on or debate the amendments in committee--if you get amendments in committee--I am going to support you in whatever efforts I can, no matter what side of the aisle your desk is on. And I will keep working toward the same goals too, even after I leave this [STREET]. Remember, though, as we get into the vitriol, as we get into political rhetoric--just remember the [PERSON]1 law of politics, adapted from [PERSON]8 third law. Just remember that for every action, even in politics, there is an equal and opposite reaction. If you go too far on one side or the other, you are going to get a reaction on the other side, just as hard. And that makes it harder and harder to reach that common ground. You know, in Senator [PERSON]7s book about his desk and the people in his desk, he quotes the political philosopher [PERSON]0 who observed The good things in history are usually of very short duration, but afterwards have a decisive but a short time of influence--a long influence--over what happens over long periods of time. A short time--and I know you may be thinking, well, [PERSON]2 was only here 3 [PERSON] so that is what he is talking about. But I am not. In history, I am looking at something bigger--whether it was [PERSON]1 2 [PERSON] or my 3 Senator [PERSON]2 6 Senator [PERSON]s 12 Senator PERSON51s [LOCATION]01 or [PERSON]s and [PERSON]6 [LOCATION]02 or, if you are like [PERSON]7, since [PERSON]8 was in the bulrushes. Our time here is short. There is not anybody on this floor right now who is not thinking about their time since they were sworn in and said that it was just like yesterDATE[DATE], because it was. Our time is short. It is of a limited duration, and we have to act like that. We have to make sure that [LOCATION]7 we are moving. It has been a realization of a long-held dream. I have so many to thank [PERSON]2 [ORGANIZATION], who is here [PERSON]0, on my campaigns and my late friend, [PERSON]1 and an amazing family my bride [PERSON]2, my rock my two boys, [PERSON]3 and [PERSON]4, who have wanted to kill both me and [PERSON]2 since they have been living at home during the pandemic. They have been incredibly supportive. And then my daughter [PERSON]5 and her husband [PERSON]6 and her two beautiful girls, my granddaughters, who are still the brightest stars in my sky, [PERSON]7 and [PERSON]8. I am grateful to each of you, my colleagues, and all that you helped me with. I am grateful to an amazing staff. I am not going to go all the [STREET] through it. They have been true rock stars. I am going to enter something into the [DATE] about my staff. I am grateful for the advice and counsel of [PERSON]9s senior Senator and an old friend, Senator [PERSON]3. While [PERSON]9 and I may disagree on many policies, we share a commitment to the people of [PERSON]9 to make sure that we do all we can to get the people in [PERSON]9 the quality of life that [PERSON] S7305 they deserve, and I so much appreciate [PERSON]9s service to the people of the ORG2 of [PERSON]9, his long and distinguished service--which started out as a Democrat, by the [STREET], just saying. That is where the seed was planted, folks. I also want to mention briefly the chairmen of the committees I worked on Senator [PERSON]01, Senator PERSON58, Senator PERSON51--who was one of the first people who helped me come over--and the work that we did together. You pulled me and helped me. Senator [PERSON], who chaired [LOCATION]. But I am especially grateful for the ranking members of those committees Senators [PERSON]7, [PERSON]02, [PERSON]03, and [PERSON]. Their friendship and counsel have been invaluable. Of course, I want to thank the minority leader for all of his work for me and on behalf of me. And as I think you guys know--not always the people of [PERSON]9--Senator [PERSON] never tried to put puppet strings on me. I know I got accused of that, but he never ever tried and, for that, I am very grateful. To the people of [PERSON]9, I promised to do my best to represent each of you, whether or not you voted for me, and I am proud of the work that we did on your behalf and that I have accomplished on your behalf. Thank you to the people for giving me the honor of serving you as your Senator. Finally, I am going to resist the urge to tell you what is wrong with the [ORGANIZATION], how it operates [PERSON]. You hear it virtually every time a Senator gives a farewell address, and, instinctively, you know it deep down. But I will offer you this. There is a book I finished reading recently that [PERSON]04, a former staffer, wrote. Many of you may remember or know [PERSON]05. He wrote a book called The Last Great [ORGANIZATION]. It ought to be required reading for every Senator coming in. It was published 8 [PERSON] ago, about the two [ORGANIZATION]es during the [PERSON]06 administration and how they operated--[PERSON]07 as majority leader, [PERSON]08 as the minority leader, how they got things done for the [PERSON]8n people. The author laments that the [ORGANIZATION] doesnt operate [PERSON] in that fashion. I was here for one of those [PERSON]. Senator [PERSON]09 was here during that time. His closing is even more important [PERSON] as it was when the book was published. He said [PERSON]8 is adrift in turbulent and dangerous waters. Facing enormous challenges at home and abroad, we urgently need our once-vaunted political system to function at its best, instead of at its worst. To be sure, it is more difficult being a senator [PERSON] than it was in the [LOCATION]05 and [LOCATION]06. The increasingly vitriolic political culture, fueled by a twenty-four-hour news cycle, the endless pressure to raise money, the proliferation of lobbyists and demanding, organized interests are all well known, and they take a toll. But all of those factors make it more essential that our country has a [ORGANIZATION] of men and women who bring wisdom, judgment, experience, and independence to their work, along with an understanding that the [ORGANIZATION] must be able to take a collective action in the national interest. Please remember that as you go about the countrys business remember that as you go about the [ORGANIZATION]s business remember that as you go about your business as a Senator. And as you do, keep and preserve the reverence that the [ORGANIZATION] envisioned for this body. As former Majority Leader [PERSON]6 Mansfield once said, The constitutional authority . . . does not lie with the leadership. It lies with all of us, individually, collectively, and equally. . . . In the end, it is not the Senators as individuals who are of fundamental importance. . . . In the end, it is the institution of the [ORGANIZATION]. It is the [ORGANIZATION] itself as one of the foundations of the Constitution. It is the [ORGANIZATION] as one of the rocks of the Republic. Something we should all remember. One more little bit of advice. Take out the word negotiation when you are talking about legislation. Dont talk about negotiating this bill or that bill, whether it is [PERSON] relief or even appropriations. It works, but let me tell you what is happening out there, what is happening out there with the people. They hear those words, and they think this is some side or the other trying to get an advantage. It is like labor and unions. It is like a civil or criminal lawsuit. Somebody is trying to get an advantage to try to do things for their own interests. We can talk about it from the Democratic side of how we are working for the people we are negotiating for the people. We can talk about it from the Republican side that we are negotiating for patriotism and businesses to make sure they are protected. But what is being heard by the [PERSON]8n people is this is all about Democrats this is all about Republicans and getting that political power. Talk about common ground. Talk about sitting down with the administration or whomever and finding common ground. Talk about the goals that you agree on and how to get there. Negotiation is just a bad word, and I hate that, but it is. As I prepare for the next chapter of my lifes journey, there is a sadness of what I am going to leave behind, but there is also optimism--optimism, the glass half full, the men and women who serve in this body and their successors and the staff who support them. And I emphasize that, again, the staff who support them. Leading together will continue to bring a better future for the [PERSON]8n people, for your constituents, for each of us together, not as a caucus but together as a [ORGANIZATION]. You are just a damn, unbeatable team. You are an unbeatable team. [LOCATION]28 [PERSON]4 bless you all. [LOCATION]28 [PERSON]4 continue to bless [PERSON] of [PERSON]8. Mr. President, with a deep sense of humility and gratitude, I say for the last time, I yield the floor. Applause, Senators rising. The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr. [PERSON]11. The Senator from [PERSON]9. Mr. [PERSON]12. What a good speech here. We dont hear them like that [LOCATION]7. To my colleague Senator [PERSON]1, 3 [PERSON] was not a long time here, but we feel his presence. I can tell you that I have known [PERSON]2 a long time. I remember I came to the [PERSON] ORG17 when he came up to work in the [ORGANIZATION] for Senator [PERSON]13 in [ORGANIZATION] and so forth. I supported him when he was nominated by President [PERSON]14 to be the [PERSON] attorney in [PERSON]8 of [PERSON]9, where he did a tremendous job. I worked with him DATE[DATE] after DATE[DATE], as we all do, on a lot of issues that affected the country but affected, especially, our ORG2 of [PERSON]9 at times, and we worked hand in glove. We have become friends. We have our differences, but we also have a lot of things that he talked about [PERSON] where we would come together for the ORG2 and for the country. I wish him well. I think we will hear more from him in [LOCATION]07, in the [ORGANIZATION] ahead. I certainly hope so. He has a lot to give. He has a great family. He has a great wife in [PERSON]2 and a great partner there. He has a great staff and we worked together and we will continue to do this. But one theme--and I like that he kept expounding on it here [PERSON]-- that if we work together in the [ORGANIZATION], Republicans and Democrats, we get things done if not, things dont happen. I wish Senator [PERSON]1 [PERSON]4speed and wish him the best Mr. President, [PERSON] I would like to speak about my fellow [PERSON]9 colleague and friend, Senator [PERSON]1. I have known [PERSON]1 since he was a young staffer working for Senator [PERSON]4 on the [ORGANIZATION] ORG52 Committee. During his 3 [PERSON] as a Member in the [ORGANIZATION], I believe we have worked well together. He and his staff have shown a lot of professionalism and class while in PERSON29. He is respected by all of his colleagues on both sides of the aisle. While we may not agree on every policy, [PERSON]2 understands the [ORGANIZATION] and respects the institution. It has been an honor to serve with him. [PERSON]15 and I have enjoyed spending time with [PERSON]2 and [PERSON]2, and we wish them all the best. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from [PERSON]3. Mr. [PERSON]16. I am going to be very, very short. The truth is that serving with [PERSON]1 has been a once-in-a- lifetime opportunity for me. This guys last name shouldnt be [PERSON]1 it should be [ORGANIZATION]. He is somebody like nobody I [PERSON] S7306 have ever seen, whose moral compass is so tuned into right that it has just been an incredible pleasure for me to be able to serve with him and to know him and to also wish him the best moving forward. I dont think we have heard the last of [PERSON]1. [PERSON]2 is not the kind of person who will shrink away. There will be another moment where he can exhibit his ability of common sense, as he has done here in the [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION] for the last 3 [PERSON]. I am deeply going to miss his friendship and his ability to sort the wheat from the chaff because he has been able to do that from [ORGANIZATION]9 and continued [PERSON] with his farewell speech. I just want to say, [PERSON]4 bless you, [PERSON]1, and [PERSON]4 bless your family. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from [PERSON]9. Mr. [PERSON]1EXANDER. Mr. President, I heard a lot about [PERSON]1 before he got here from another courageous former [PERSON] attorney, [PERSON]18 from [PERSON]0. I was not disappointed when he arrived. [PERSON]1 reminds me of another former Democrat who was very effective in the [ORGANIZATION], PERSON55 [PERSON]6. PERSON55 [PERSON]6 would come on the floor and make the most--well, no one could ever say he abandoned his principles, based upon his speeches. He would stand back there in the back, and the things he would say would rally any Republican [PERSON] Day Dinner. In fact, all I had to do back in [PERSON]9 to stir up the Republican crowd was to mention PERSON55 [PERSON]6. I did that on a regular basis. However, when I made my maiden address, without my knowing it, PERSON55 [PERSON]6 went around and got 20 cosponsors for the legislation I introduced [ORGANIZATION]4, and I got a good dose of what it means to be an effective [PERSON] Senator, somebody who sticks to his or her opinions but, at the same time, who knows we are here to try to work on some sticky issues and get a result that most of us can vote for and that the country can accept. In his time here, [PERSON]1 did that. I got to watch him because he was a member of ORG61. Senator [PERSON]6 used to chair that committee, working with Senator [PERSON], Senator [PERSON]20, Senator [PERSON]21, and others to produce a lot of legislation. He used to say that committee has one-third of all the jurisdiction in the [ORGANIZATION]. [LOCATION]28be that is about right. [PERSON]1 was one of the newest Senators. We have 23 members. He was [STREET] down at the end of the line, but I noticed he always came and he always asked questions and he always listened. He seemed to me to be trying to say what he believed but learn from the witnesses how to get a result. Let me just mention one contribution he made that I think will stick with him and with the people of [PERSON]9 and this country for a long time. That was the work we did in DATE90. Senator [PERSON]03 and I, [PERSON]1, Senator [PERSON]22, Senator [PERSON]23 of [PERSON]1 were on it from the beginning to do two things at once that helped low-income [PERSON]8ns who wanted to go to college. The first was to simplify the dreaded ORG64, the ORG19 Aid application form that 20 million [PERSON]8ns fill out [LOCATION]10 that is 108 questions long. About 90 of them are unnecessary everybody agrees. For [PERSON], we have been working on that to try to simplify it. Finally, we got a significant part of that done. [PERSON]1 played a major role in that because what that legislation did was to say to the low-income family in [PERSON]9 or [PERSON]9 or [PERSON]5 or [PERSON]2--wherever--you dont have to send your tax information into [ORGANIZATION] twice and let them then see if they can catch you making a mistake and hold up your [PERSON] grant for 2 [ORGANIZATION] while you figure that out. All you have to do is check a box, and ORG63 will fill out the tax questions on your [PERSON] grant application for you so that there is no chance of making a mistake. That made a big difference. And at the very same time, we agreed--Republicans and Democrats--to permanently fund historically Black colleges. It was a goal that had been there for a long time. So I would say to my friend from [PERSON]9 that I hope he puts that on his wall somewhere because that helps [TIME] hundred thousand low-income families in [PERSON]9 alone. There is some work still to be done on that to finish the job, to finish the ORG64 simplification, and there may be some other support for historically Black colleges that we might even be able to get done while you and I are still here. Yet I wanted to acknowledge a Senator who arrived, went to work, stuck to his principles, worked across the aisle, and got results. You cant have a much better scorecard than that. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from [PERSON]3. Mr. [PERSON]24. Mr. President, I also rise to acknowledge my dear, dear friend [PERSON]2, but I do it in a different vein. So many good things have been said, and I think anyone who knows [PERSON]2 or who has paid attention to what has been said [PERSON] had found it has been very accurate as far as his having a commitment to the rule of law and his compassion for any person, especially for those who havent had the same opportunities as all of us have had in life. That is what has moved us all. Yet I have gotten to see him in a different light. He and [PERSON]2 invited me down. I got to campaign with them, and it was all about [PERSON]9. I got to go down and spend a couple of DATE[DATE]s. That tells you of the true person. It not only tells you what he believes and what he feels for the people of his ORG2 and how he represents them, but it truly tells us what the people of his ORG2 think of him. I saw it firsthand. I saw it at a football game. Now, [PERSON]25 and I grew up together in a small, little coal mining community. I want you to know that [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]26 and [PERSON]27, his wife, send their best. They want to thank you for your service. To see the fans gather around [PERSON]2 and to see the happiness that he and [PERSON]2 had when we were just out, going through the tailgates, was a wonderful, wonderful sight. That tells me everything about his purpose for being here. I hope those in [PERSON]9 know how truly fortunate they are to have this gentleman, who loves [PERSON]9 with every fiber and bone in his body. He has given them everything he has and has represented their ORG2 better than any ORG2 I have ever seen represented with the true passion that he has. I love you, buddy. Thank you The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from [PERSON]4. Mr. [PERSON]28. Mr. President, I have had the privilege of serving with many, many Senators of both parties and with very many whom I have applauded. Some stand out specially--some for their longevity and some for who they are. [PERSON]1 stands out for who he is. I think, in listening to his work as a prosecutor--of course, that is near and dear to my heart in my having been a prosecutor--I had never faced what he had. I think of his discussion of the summation he gave in the trial of the people involved with the bombing of the church in [PERSON]9 and the killing and maiming of youngsters. In fact, I had a chance to meet one of the survivors of that with [PERSON]2, and I saw how she had felt about him all these [PERSON] later because he had had the courage to stand up and do something that may not have been popular with some in his ORG2, but that had been the right thing to do. In all of the [PERSON] I have known him here, what he has done has been the right thing to do. Now, I have only had one objection about him. He showed me a picture that was taken when this young man, [PERSON]1, was working for [PERSON]4--Judge [PERSON]13, as I recall. They were standing there with these gray beards, and this Senator from [PERSON]4 asked Who is the youngster in the picture? Senator [PERSON]1, thank you for bringing that. I know [PERSON]29, in my office, got a kick out of that because she had the opportunity to work with you. We have done things that we have been able to joke about, like being in an airplane, where he was sitting in the front and I was sitting in the back. Fortunately, it was on the ground. Senator [PERSON]1 hollered out to somebody, one of the military people there Where is the button for the ejection seat for the back? It caught my attention. [PERSON] S7307 I have also seen this man sit there and try to discuss legislation. He would ask How will that help people? I dont want this because it is politically beneficial to me. How will it help people? I have heard about towns now in [PERSON]9 that I had never heard about. I have also heard things he would tell me about that would make me think of towns in [PERSON]4 and make me realize we were talking about the same problems. Never once would he say These are Republicans or these are Democrats. He would say These are people in [PERSON]9 who need help. So we would work on that. I will speak further about this, but, Senator [PERSON]1, I think of you and your wonderful family. I think of the trips you and your wife and my wife and I have taken together, and I feel that I have been a better Senator for knowing you and traveling with you and listening to you. I will miss you, my friend, and I will speak further on this. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader. Mr. [PERSON]30. Mr. President, there is something about this [PERSON]1. From the earliest stages in his life, he knew he was going to be a little bit different. When I grew up in [PERSON]5, [PERSON]6, it was expected that my childhood hero would be ORG65 great [PERSON]32. But when you grew up in [PERSON]0, [PERSON]1--also a baseball fan as a boy--it turned out that your childhood heroes included [PERSON]8, [PERSON]33, and [PERSON]34. I am not sure how that goes over in [LOCATION], to say that you are rooting for a team called the ORG66. But you did it, and you knew from the start, in your youth, that you were willing to strike out and do the radical, controversial thing. You were 9 [PERSON] old in [LOCATION]26 [ORGANIZATION]0 when four members of [ORGANIZATION] [LOCATION]5 bombed FAC5 in nearby [PERSON]2, killing four innocent, young girls who were not much older than you were. Fourteen [PERSON] later, you were an idealistic, young law student who skipped class to sit in on the trial of the ringleader of that church bombing. You were mesmerized when listening to [PERSON]9s then- attorney general--the lead prosecutor in the case--tell the jury It is never too late for justice. The jury agreed and convicted the bomber. You would go on to marry [PERSON]2, and [PERSON]4 blessed you with three beautiful children--two sons and a daughter. Yet the memories of those four little girls who were killed in their church never left you. In his eulogy for the four fallen girls, Dr. [PERSON]35 said that the girls say to each of us, Black and White alike, that we must substitute courage for caution. They say to us that we must be concerned not merely about who murdered them but about the system, the [STREET] of life, and the philosophy which produced the murderers. Their deaths say to us that we must work passionately and unrelentingly for the realization of the [PERSON]8n dream. I am sure a lot of people heard those words and nodded, but you heard those words, and you were inspired. In [LOCATION]17, as the [PERSON] attorney for [PERSON]8 of [PERSON]9, you led the successful effort to try and convict the remaining two coconspirators in the church bombing. Both men were sentenced to life in prison. In that same office, you coordinated a joint ORG2-ORG19 task force that led to the indictment of domestic terrorist [PERSON]4. You advocated that [PERSON]36 should stand trial first in [PERSON]2 for the deadly bombing in that city of a womens [INSTITUTION] before being tried in [PERSON]7 for the Centennial [ORGANIZATION] bombing. All told, these and other bombings killed 2 people and injured more than 150. [PERSON]36 pleaded guilty and was sentenced to four life terms in prison because of your commitment. I was honored, during the course of the campaign, [PERSON]2, to do a joint fundraiser with you and [PERSON]2 and [PERSON]37, my wife. I got to sit out on my deck in [PERSON]8 and listen to [PERSON]38 and [PERSON]39. It was a lot of fun that [TIME]. Sometimes campaigns are fun. It certainly was to be with you and [PERSON]2 on that particular [TIME]. I want to close by saying that you shocked me on the floor of the [ORGANIZATION] with your first speech. I couldnt believe that this new Senator from the ORG2 of [PERSON]9 would give a speech about guns and gun violence. It really told me all I needed to know about you right then and there. You are willing to stick out your neck for something you believe in, even if it is going to be controversial and even if you are going to catch hell for it, because you believe in it sincerely. I know you are a proud hunter and gun owner, and there is no question in my mind about your views on that issue. Yet, after the FAC10 [TIME]club shooting in [PERSON]9, [ORGANIZATION]0, that took the lives of 49 young men and women--one of the worst mass shootings in the [ORGANIZATION]7s history--you supported tighter background checks for gun sales and raising the age requirement to purchase a semiautomatic weapon. I want to personally thank you, as well, for showing exceptional political courage in cosponsoring my D[ORGANIZATION] legislation in the Dream Act. I will never forget it. I am also proud that you were an original cosponsor of [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION]. That wasnt an easy one either for anybody and for you especially, but you stood up for what you believed in. That is legislation that I joined in introducing with our friend [PERSON]40 and soon-to-be Vice President [PERSON]6. So you have left your mark. It may seem like a short time in the [ORGANIZATION], but there are those who have served for much longer who have a lot less to show for it. You told us who you were on your first DATE[DATE], and you proved it [LOCATION]7 thereafter. It has been an honor to count you as a colleague. I know that you are going to continue to find ways to bend that moral arc of the universe toward justice, and I look forward to supporting you in every [STREET] that I can in that goal. I wish you the best. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. [PERSON]41 of [ORGANIZATION]1. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Coronavirus Relief Mr. [PERSON]41 of [ORGANIZATION]1. Mr. President, I came to the [ORGANIZATION] 2 [PERSON] ago because the people of [ORGANIZATION]1 entrusted me to fight against the broken ways of PERSON29 and the out-of-control spending that is threatening the future of our children and our grandchildren. I am fighting [LOCATION]7 against the political class in PERSON29-- the same elites that scoff when people like me say that government needs to be run like a business. They say government is too complicated to run like a business, but I say that any elected official or government bureaucrat who believes that should resign [LOCATION]20 because they are part of the problem. It is time to wake up. It is time to wake up to the fact that every dime spent in PERSON29 belongs to [PERSON]8n taxpayers, and every dollar spent now is a tax increase for a future generation. It is time to wake up to the fact that our [ORGANIZATION]7 is more than 27 trillion in debt. [PERSON]7y cent we spend moving forward threatens our ability to fund our military and our safety nets like [PERSON], [PERSON], and ORG70. It is time to wake up to the fact that our position as the leader of the free world is not promised and shouldnt be taken for granted. Irresponsible career politicians who care more about their next election than the future of our country will run this [ORGANIZATION]7 into the ground if we let them, and I am fighting like hell to make sure they dont. Now, let me be clear. I support another relief measure to help our small businesses and individuals who are hurting because of the coronavirus. For [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] Republicans have been trying to pass responsible and targeted measures to quickly help those in need. And for [ORGANIZATION], Democrats have blocked these measures because of politics. [PERSON]42 admitted it. She said she purposely stood in the [STREET] of the deal until after the [ORGANIZATION] election so that politics would be in their favor to avoid considerations in the legislation that we dont want. It is shameful and exactly why the [PERSON]8n people are fed up with PERSON29. [PERSON] S7308 [ORGANIZATION] has already allocated 2 trillion in direct and indirect aid to [DATE] and localities. And we know, unfortunately, because [ORGANIZATION] tried to get this money out the door as quickly as possible, many programs within the CARES Act are riddled with waste, inefficiency, and fraud. Now a group of my colleagues want to spend another trillion dollars, including almost 200 billion to bail out liberal [DATE] with [PERSON] who cant do the basic job they were elected to do--manage their own budgets. And we dont even know how much is still unspent from the previous coronavirus relief packages. I have reached out to every single Governor--twice now--to learn exactly how they have spent the hundreds of billions of dollars they have already received, and only 10 have replied. They wont tell us because they dont want us to know there are still billions of dollars left unspent. They dont want us to know that the real purpose is to take taxpayer money meant to help get through this crisis and use it to backfill their inefficient and wasteful budgets and pension programs. Liberal [PERSON] and mayors around the country think the [PERSON]8n people are stupid. They think taxpayers in [DATE] like [ORGANIZATION]1 wont realize if [ORGANIZATION] uses their taxpayer money to bail out [DATE] like [ORGANIZATION]2 and [ORGANIZATION]3 and pay for those [DATE] wasteful spending. Governor [PERSON]43 has had his hand out for a bailout despite the fact that [ORGANIZATION]3s tax revenues for [LOCATION]21 are running 9.9 billion or [LOCATION]01.6 percent above projections. Personal income tax revenue in [LOCATION]22 was 1 billion--15.6 percent higher than in the previous [LOCATION]22 i [ORGANIZATION]3, and sales taxes were up 9.2 percent. For the last 4 [ORGANIZATION], overall revenue in [ORGANIZATION]3 has exceeded [LOCATION]25 forecasts and even DATE90 collections. This is a ORG2 that paid 1.5 million to the chief investment officer of its public pension fund, who was actively investing in companies tied to ORG71, only to later find out this person was personally invested in companies with ties to ORG71. You cant make this stuff up. How is that for pension waste and a national security threat? It is the same story with Governor [PERSON]44. [ORGANIZATION]2s overall tax revenue was up 4.3 percent in [LOCATION]26 compared to [LOCATION]26 DATE90. These are the same [PERSON] who are OK issuing new stay-at-home orders that are killing small businesses. As long as they get more money from [ORGANIZATION] to backfill their budgets and pension plans, they dont care how many people in their [DATE] have to suffer. These [PERSON] and mayors dont care, as long as they dont have to follow their own oppressive rules. [PERSON] not forget about [PERSON]42 and the hair salon, [ORGANIZATION]3 Governor Gavin [PERSON]43 dining at [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]5 [LOCATION]28or [PERSON]46 encouraging constituents to stay home from his timeshare in [ORGANIZATION]6. Do as I say, not as I do. These liberal politicians who refuse to open their [DATE] or spend taxpayer money wisely are seeing high numbers of unemployment. Most of the [DATE] with the highest unemployment rate in the country are controlled by Democrats. On the other hand, Republican-led [DATE] that are making the hard choices to get on a fiscally responsible path and reopen their economy safely are succeeding and seeing lower unemployment rates. Thirty [DATE] have halved their unemployment rate since [LOCATION]28, while real GDP grew 33 percent in [LOCATION]29, erasing losses from [LOCATION]30. You can see there, this is from a ORG73 editorial--if you havent heard, states are experiencing a surge of-- tax revenue. Politicians dont want this good news to get out because they want to get more of our money from [DATE] like [ORGANIZATION]1 to pay for the budgets of [PERSON]2, [ORGANIZATION]2, [ORGANIZATION]3, and [ORGANIZATION]7. You can see the GDP growth of 33 percent in [LOCATION]31. Over here you can see [DATE] have seen a big drop-off in their unemployment rates by half over the last 6 [ORGANIZATION], and there has been a big growth in private sector employment, but it doesnt stop these liberal [PERSON] and mayors from wanting more money. Look, I know everyone wants to help our [DATE], and so do [ORGANIZATION] We help our [DATE] by ensuring appropriate spending of the billions of dollars in taxpayer dollars already allocated. We help our [DATE] by safely opening the economy and getting [PERSON]8ns back to work. We help our [DATE] by sending money to schools to safely reopen and funding vaccine research and distribution. Most [DATE] will be in a strong position to get through this pandemic without more ORG19 aid, and that is great news for our country. But we know [ORGANIZATION]2, [ORGANIZATION]3, [PERSON]2, [ORGANIZATION]7 dont need bailouts they want bailouts so they can use that money intended to address the fallout from [PERSON] to backfill their longstanding budget problems and their pension problems. I have said all along that I will not support that. It is not fair to the citizens of [DATE] like [ORGANIZATION]1, where over my 8 [PERSON] as Governor, we made the hard choices--they were hard--that put our ORG2 on a fiscally secure path. We paid down our ORG2 debt. We cut taxes. We balanced our budget [LOCATION]10 without borrowing money. And 908 billion--908 billion--of spending [PERSON] equals a tax increase of 7,000 per [PERSON]8n family down the [STREET]. It is not money that we have. It is a tax increase of 7,000 per [PERSON]8n family down the line. Many families in our country right now are trying to figure out how to celebrate this holiDATE[DATE] season while they struggle to afford [LOCATION]35 expenses. These are people we need to be helping. You wouldnt run your business or family the [STREET] PERSON29 is run-- like there is an endless supply and no consequences to racking up unthinkable amounts of debt. That is what many of my colleagues want. But to keep spending money like this means taking away the same opportunities that I have had and others have had to live the [PERSON]8n dream, and it will take it away from our children and our grandchildren. It is time to wake up. It is time to make the hard choices to put our [ORGANIZATION]7 on a path to recovery--recovery from this virus, from the economic devastation it has brought with it, and from the fiscal calamity that DATE98 of politicians have ignored. That includes refusing to bail out wasteful [DATE] for their DATE98 of poor fiscal choices I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from [ORGANIZATION]8. [ORGANIZATION]. [DATE] Mr. [PERSON]47. Mr. President, later [PERSON], we will vote on whether to go forward with the arms sales that the administration notified the [ORGANIZATION] of [LOCATION]38. These would be arms sales to [ORGANIZATION], equipment sales. These sales clearly would continue the 20 [PERSON] of growth in our relationship, working side by side against common concerns and common enemies. This really goes back through three different administrations, going back to [LOCATION]40 and beyond, where the [ORGANIZATION] has consistently been willing to stand with us in at least six long-term deployments. They come they stay. They are side by side with us in the field. They have been with us in the air. They are flying what has previously been our best piece of aircraft at a level that we would share it with other countries that are friends of ours. This sale will continue that. It continues to allow even more interoperability between [PERSON] and the [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]2. [PERSON]2, by the [STREET], is totally supportive of this sale. The Ambassador from [ORGANIZATION] and the Ambassador from [PERSON]2 [LOCATION]41 had a public event where they both talked about the support of [PERSON]2 for this sale. As you know very well, our law requires a quantitative advantage for [PERSON]2 when we sell them equipment. We have even a slightly different advantage, but being able to continue this relationship is important. The F-35 jets, the [ORGANIZATION] unarmed aerial vehicles, advanced munitions-- I think the total sale is about 23.5 billion. And this is not any kind of gift from [PERSON] to the [ORGANIZATION]. This is the [ORGANIZATION] making a purchase totaling 23.5 billion for equipment that [PERSON] S7309 is made by [PERSON]8n companies and almost always by [PERSON]8n workers. In [LOCATION]42, we had the first breakthrough in a diplomatic sense in [ORGANIZATION] in a long time. President [PERSON] deserves credit for that. [PERSON]2 deserves credit for that. But the [ORGANIZATION] deserves credit for that. The PERSON2 accords, where the [ORGANIZATION] formally recognized [PERSON]2, began to have flights back and forth and other things that were significant in changing the environment in [ORGANIZATION], the most difficult part of the world--the greatest breakthrough in 40 [PERSON]. But that followed a number of breakthroughs that werent quite as public, where this relationship has grown--the [PERSON]2 relationship with the [ORGANIZATION]--just like our relationship has gotten stronger over time. To see the recognition of the two governments together, to see [ORGANIZATION]0 follow that--I think we are going to see other countries in the area decide that a region that lives in peace with [PERSON]2 is a good thing for everybody involved, not a bad thing for anybody. So it is important. I think how the [ORGANIZATION] deals with this is significant. We have been notified as the law requires us to be notified. Under this notification process, I dont believe any sale has been denied, and only one sale has been altered. The President has to agree. So if we debate [TIME] and somehow it narrowly passes and the President vetoes it and we dont have the votes to override the veto, which I am confident we would not have--in fact, I think we very likely have the votes to go ahead and deal with this right here, right now. It is the right thing to do. It is the right time to do it. We will never have more of a long-term runway of how things under the [PERSON]48 administration, the PERSON[LOCATION]02 administration, and the [PERSON] administration have continued to progress to where the [ORGANIZATION] has become a trusted ally. Now, they have become a trusted ally and a trusted diplomatic partner in this important breakthrough. Having this kind of equipment not only allows us to be interoperable, but frankly, it creates the opportunities for [PERSON]8n military and [PERSON]8n technicians to be working with them every time you have an upgrade, every time you have a significant maintenance issue. That just further enhances, as does working through how that equipment is used afterwards--all of that further enhances the constant dialogue, the constant reinforcement of our friends who see common enemies and are working directly to move their country and their region in a much better direction. I hope that the [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] does what it needs to do and sends that message that we understand what [PERSON]2 would like to see happen, what the [ORGANIZATION] would like to see happen, and, frankly, what will happen and happens better if this debate focuses more on what that outcome produces, rather than a debate that makes people wonder exactly what do you have to do to continue to be a trusted partner of [PERSON]. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from [ORGANIZATION]1. Mr. [PERSON]49. Mr. President, I would restate my request, whenever I come to the floor, that the Presiding Officer wear a mask because he has people sitting in front of him that could be at risk. Remembering [PERSON]50 Mr. President, [LOCATION]43, we lost a former Member of this body who truly embodied the spirit of service that should animate all of our work. His name is [PERSON]50. He passed away [TIME] DATE[DATE]s ago. He was a longtime chair of the committee of the Presiding Officer. As chair of ORG74, he was always a voice for consumers and working families, standing up against powerful corporate interests. The accomplishment that bears his name, the [PERSON]51-Oxley Act, was a landmark law in our efforts to hold corporations accountable. It helped protect [PERSON]8ns who invest hard- earned money for retirement and for their kids education from corporate banking fraud, the kind that bankrupted families after scandals like ORG75. Senator [PERSON]51 also never ignored the housing part of our committees jurisdiction. He fought to make sure that all [PERSON]8ns could find and afford a [STREET] to call home. Whenever developers tried to make a deal in [ORGANIZATION]2, he was always adamant they include affordable housing in their projects because, fundamentally, he never forgot where he came from. The son of Greek immigrants, [PERSON]50 grew up a working-class kid, bussing tables at his familys restaurant on [ORGANIZATION]. In the [ORGANIZATION], he cared about getting results for the people he served, not about getting the credit. Some of his colleagues called him the stealth senator. He welcomed the nickname. He told ORG76 that stealth is one of the most important weapons in our military arsenal. . . . If you let somebody else take the credit, you can get the result. Senator [PERSON]51 was the definition of a true public servant. [LOCATION]28 he rest in peace as he joins his beloved wife [PERSON]52. [PERSON]53 and I pray for Representative John [PERSON]51, his son, and the entire [PERSON]51 family. I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring Senator [PERSON]51 by building on his legacy, standing up to the corporations that have too much power in this country, and fighting for the working people we serve. [PERSON]50, like many others in this body, understood the dignity of work [ORGANIZATION]7al Defense Authorization Act Mr. President, yesterDATE[DATE] the ORG17 overwhelmingly passed the [ORGANIZATION]4 conference report by a veto-proof majority of 335 to 78. That bill includes our comprehensive bipartisan reform of our anti-money laundering laws. I would like to thank my colleagues, especially Senator [PERSON]01 and other ORG[DATE] colleagues Senators [PERSON]55, [PERSON]1, [PERSON], [PERSON]56, and off the committee, Senators [PERSON]57, [PERSON]58, [PERSON]59, and [PERSON]60, and the Presiding Officer, Senator [PERSON]11, for his work on this legislation. On the ORG17 side, Chairwoman [PERSON]61 and Chairman [PERSON]62 and Representative [PERSON]63, thank you to all of them for working so hard to ensure that [PERSON] we have this crucial bipartisan legislation in this defense conference report that will reform our money laundering laws and finally end abuses by anonymous shell companies. I would like to extend my thanks to a former colleague, Chairman [PERSON]64, who was chair of ORG78 and ORG79 and to President PERSON[LOCATION]02, who both voted on these issues for [PERSON]. Many of their good ideas are codified in this bill, harvesting some of the seeds they planted [PERSON] ago. The Anti-Money Laundering Act and the Corporate Transparency Act are the products of [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] of bipartisan negotiations between and among Members of the ORG17 and [ORGANIZATION] and certainly the staffs of Senator [PERSON]11 and me and Senator [PERSON]01 and others. I thank them for their good work. The bill is a critical step to fight money laundering and crack down on shell companies. While there are things I would have done differently had we been writing the bill on our own, overall, it is an effective and comprehensive response to the problem of illicit finance. I strongly support it. Criminals abuse the [PERSON] financial system to launder money from drug trafficking, organized crime, [PERSON] and [LOCATION], weapons sales, and other criminal activities. I spoke [PERSON] about this with [PERSON] [PERSON]65 of [ORGANIZATION]3, the [ORGANIZATION]4 [PERSON], a longtime sheriff, and [PERSON] Marshal [PERSON]66 of [ORGANIZATION]5 of [PERSON]8. They welcomed this language, and they welcome this law. This will help them do their jobs better. Much of this dirty money that comes from organized crime in [LOCATION], weapons sales, drug trafficking, and sex trafficking is laundered through anonymous shell corporations. These are not victimless crimes. They directly hurt [ORGANIZATION]1 communities, especially those torn apart by the opioid crisis. [ORGANIZATION]6 cartel actors and [PERSON] traffickers have been destroying thousands of families. They use money laundering to get their drug money in and out of the country. Human traffickers who prey on runaways at truck stops along major interstate highways in [ORGANIZATION]1 and across the country also use the financial system to launder their profits. We need to give law enforcement new modern tools to stop their crimes. [PERSON] S7310 The bill finally requires comprehensive reporting by [PERSON] companies of their actual owners--no more hiding these abuses in anonymous shell companies. It cracks down on bankers who look the other [STREET] to actively aid money laundering and cracks down on [ORGANIZATION] that have shoddy compliance systems. If you are helping drug traders hide their illegal fentanyl profits, you deserve more than a slap on the wrist. Banks cannot be too big to jail, and laws cant treat them that [STREET]. I will closely monitor how this critical legislation is being implemented. I spoke [LOCATION]46 already with the Secretary of [ORGANIZATION]0 designee and the Deputy Secretary of [ORGANIZATION]0 designee about being ready to administer and enforce these laws. I look forward to working with the administration to ensure that [ORGANIZATION]0 puts in [STREET] effective anti-money laundering and corporate transparency rules to implement the bill as soon as possible. We know that criminals have long been revising their tactics to get around our current laws. This bill will enable us to get ahead of them and stay ahead of them. I urge my colleagues to support it. They supported this language in the [ORGANIZATION]4, and I ask them to support the [ORGANIZATION]4 Taken together, as we designed them, these measures reform, update and strengthen our current anti-money laundering laws and make critical changes to [PERSON] corporate disclosure laws to combat abuses by owners of anonymous shell companies--including foreign owners from [PERSON], [PERSON], [LOCATION], GPE[DATE] and other countries--who have for [PERSON] been exploiting our system for criminal purposes. The legislation strengthens the [ORGANIZATION]0 [ORGANIZATION]3s financial intelligence, anti-money laundering [ORGANIZATION], and countering the financing of terrorism [ORGANIZATION] programs, modernizing our legal regime and improving communication, oversight, and information-sharing in these areas. The conference agreement requires much more routine and systemic coordination, communication, and feedback among financial institutions, regulators, and law enforcement, to enable them to identify and act on suspicious financial activities, better target bank resources on critical [ORGANIZATION] tasks, and increase the likelihood of bad actors being caught by law enforcement. It also provides for new whistleblower protections for those reporting [ORGANIZATION] violations and provides for payment of whistleblower rewards. It establishes tough new penalties on those convicted of serious [ORGANIZATION] violations, including additional penalties for repeat violators, and imposes a ban on financial-institution board service for those convicted of egregious [ORGANIZATION]-related crimes. It would require important new reporting from [ORGANIZATION]1 and [ORGANIZATION]0 to better enable [ORGANIZATION] to oversee the use of-- and sometimes continuing violations by banks under--deferred prosecution agreements and non-prosecution agreements, which too often are a slap on the wrist by regulators for banks that evade sanctions, violate our [ORGANIZATION] rules, or otherwise violate banking laws. As I have said, banks cant be too big to jail, and regulators cant treat them that [STREET]. To help accomplish all these goals, the conference agreement authorizes additional funding for the [ORGANIZATION]0 [ORGANIZATION]3, and we expect the [ORGANIZATION]3 to insist on strong accountability for results and to be responsive to congressional oversight as its officials work to implement this legislation. In addition, the bill finally requires comprehensive reporting by [PERSON] companies of their actual owners. No more hiding in the dark abuses by anonymous shell companies to commit crimes. Unlike in most areas of reform and transparency, where the [PERSON] has led the [STREET], on this issue of anonymous shell companies we have long lagged behind other nations, and failed to require uniform and clear ownership information for firms at the time of their incorporation in the states. This information is critical to law enforcement. In the [PERSON] investigators often have to spend precious time and resources issuing subpoenas and chasing down leads--sometimes jumping from anonymous shell company to anonymous shell company--to secure basic information about who actually owns a company. That makes no sense. And with this bill, it will end. [ORGANIZATION]0s [ORGANIZATION]7al Money Laundering Risk Assessment estimates that around 300 billion in illicit proceeds from domestic financial crime is generated [PERSON]0ly. Criminals have for a very long time abused our financial system to launder funds gained through narcotics trafficking, organized crime, [PERSON] and [LOCATION], weapons proliferation and other criminal activities. Much of this dirty money is laundered through anonymous shell corporations. Over the [PERSON] we have heard all about these abuses, from the Panama Papers to the Paradise Papers to, more recently [PERSON]1, the series of news articles called the [ORGANIZATION]6 files. These exposures of abuses in our system by dedicated journalists and national and international transparency organizations have highlighted problems involving human trafficking, drug trafficking, terrorism, money laundering, fraud, tax evasion, and other crimes involving illicit finance. None of these abuses are victimless crimes. Money laundering for drug cartels has a direct line to the opioid crisis in [ORGANIZATION]1, where [ORGANIZATION]6 cartel actors or fentanyl traffickers have been destroying thousands of families. Combined with the pandemic, these drugs have hurt thousands of [ORGANIZATION]1 families. Human traffickers who exploit the misery of runaways in truckstops along major interstate highways in [ORGANIZATION]1 and across the country use the financial system to launder their profits. [PERSON] fraudsters cost the taxpayers 2.6 billion in one [LOCATION]48, according to [ORGANIZATION]5 Inspector General, and tarnish the reputation of this lifeline for seniors. Thats why anti-money laundering and corporate transparency laws are so critical they protect the integrity of our financial system, provide critical intelligence to law enforcement to combat crime and help give victims the tools they need to hold bad actors accountable. Under [ORGANIZATION]0s existing rules, banks are already working to secure some of this information from accountholders when they open accounts. And while banks must continue to play a key monitoring role, its also important that we finally, after all these [PERSON], require companies to provide basic information on their ownership when theyre formed. The bill contains a strong definition of beneficial owner which includes a two-part test covering individuals who, directly or indirectly, exercise substantial control over an entity or hold or control an ownership interest in the entity. The definition is clear that a nominee, intermediary, custodian, or agent acting on behalf of another individual cannot be the beneficial owner of an entity. Nominees are not beneficial owners neither are trustees or attorneys acting as agents. The definition is also clear that employees do not qualify as beneficial owners of an entity unless, apart from their employment status, they hold an ownership interest in the entity or can exercise substantial control over the entity such as the ability to transfer some or all of the entitys assets or earnings to their personal use. The provision defines beneficial owner as an individual who directly or indirectly owns or controls not less than 25 percent of the ownership interests of the entity. When applying this part of the test, [ORGANIZATION]6 must consider what to do if no one individual meets the 25 percent minimum, and how that situation may trigger the second part of the beneficial owner test which requires disclosure of the individuals who exercise substantial control over the entity. To determine whether an individual exercises substantial control over an entity, [ORGANIZATION]6 is not intended to devise a numerical, narrow, or rigid test. Instead, the standard is intended to function with flexibility to take into account the myriad ways that an individual may exercise control over an entity while holding minimal or even no formal ownership interest. They include written and unwritten agreements, arrangements, or understandings, instructions to company directors or officers, letter of wishes, [PERSON] S7311 control over personnel decisions, economic pressure on company shareholders or employees, coercion, bribery, threats of bodily harm, and other legal and illegal means of exercising control. Evidence that one or more individuals are exercising substantial control over a specific entity is expected to vary widely and may encompass such matters as emailed or telephoned instructions from the individuals suspected of being beneficial owners or their agents, employment or personnel decisions made at the direction or with the approval of such individuals, financial accounts that name such individuals as signatories, investment decisions made at the direction or recommendation of such individuals, or transfers of funds or assets to or at the direction of such individuals. Requiring companies to provide their ownership information and storing it in a secure federal database like [ORGANIZATION]6s, alongside account holders banking information, will help address longstanding problems for [PERSON] law enforcement. It will help them investigate and prosecute cases involving terrorism, weapons proliferation, drug trafficking, money laundering, [PERSON] and [LOCATION], human trafficking, and other crimes. And it will provide ready access to this information under long-established and effective privacy rules. Without these reforms, criminals, terrorists and even rogue nations could continue to use layer upon layer of shell companies to disguise and launder illicit funds. That makes it harder to hold bad actors accountable, and puts us all at risk. The bill also contains certain exemptions. The basic justification behind the bills exemptions is that each exempt category refers to entities that already disclose their beneficial owners to the government in one [STREET] or another and so dont need to duplicate that disclosure in the [ORGANIZATION]6 database. For example, publicly traded companies already disclose their true owners to the [ORGANIZATION]8, and banks already disclose their true owners to federal bank regulators there is no reason to require those entities to disclose the same information to [ORGANIZATION]6. Each of the exemptions should be interpreted as narrowly as possible to exclude entities that do not disclose their beneficial owners to the government. Exemptions created for pooled investment vehicles, dormant companies, and certain nonprofits require especially narrow interpretations to limit those exemptions to entities that provide some level of ownership disclosure to the government. The exemption for pooled investment vehicles is intended to be available only to [ORGANIZATION]s that rely for investment advice and services on a regulated bank or on a securities broker-dealer, investment company, or investment adviser that is registered with the [ORGANIZATION]8, has disclosed its own beneficial ownership information to the federal government, and has filed a Form ADV disclosing the [ORGANIZATION]s legal name and any other information related to the [ORGANIZATION] that the federal government may require. In addition, [ORGANIZATION]s formed under the laws of a foreign jurisdiction must file with [ORGANIZATION]6 a certification identifying every individual that exercises substantial control over the [ORGANIZATION], providing the same information required for beneficial owners. Because evidence shows that criminals, fraudsters, and [PERSON] adversaries are increasingly using [ORGANIZATION]s to launder funds and commit other wrongdoing, this exemption is of special concern and should be subject to continuous, careful review by [ORGANIZATION]0 as provided in the new 31 [PERSON].C 5336i to see whether it should be retained or removed. The exemption for dormant companies is intended to function solely as a grandfathering provision that exempts from disclosure only those dormant companies in existence prior to the bills enactment those grandfathered entities are also required to immediately disclose their beneficial owners to [ORGANIZATION]6 as soon as their ownership changes hands, they become active entities, or they otherwise lose their exempt status. No entity created after the date of enactment of the bill is intended to qualify for exemption as a dormant company. The exemption provided to certain charitable and nonprofit entities also merits narrow construction and careful review in light of past evidence of wrongdoers misusing charities, foundations, and other nonprofit entities to launder funds and advance criminal and civil misconduct. This exemption is intended to apply only to entities that are engaged in charitable or nonprofit activities, and not to entities engaged in for-profit businesses or for-profit activities. The exemption is based, in part, upon provisions in [PERSON] and state laws that enable federal and state officials to regulate and investigate nonprofit organizations to ensure, for example, that the individuals behind them are not using the entitys assets to inappropriately enrich themselves, unfairly compete against businesses that pay taxes, or advance other inappropriate objectives. In addition, the exemption given to entities that operate exclusively to provide financial assistance to or hold governance rights over a charitable entity is intended to be even more restrictive it is confined to entities that qualify as [PERSON] persons under [PERSON] tax law, have only [PERSON] citizens or residents as their beneficial owners, and derive at least a majority of their funds from [PERSON] persons--meaning the exemption is not available under any circumstance for entities formed under foreign laws, established for foreign beneficial owners, or funded primarily with foreign funds. Again, these exemptions are intended to be narrowly interpreted to prevent their use by entities that otherwise fail to disclose their beneficial owners to the federal government. To ensure the bills exemptions function as intended, the [ORGANIZATION]0, [ORGANIZATION]6, [ORGANIZATION]9, [ORGANIZATION]0, [ORGANIZATION]8, [ORGANIZATION]1, and other federal regulators should review and, if necessary, strengthen their filing forms to ensure that beneficial as well as nominal owners are disclosed to the federal government by the specified exempt entities, including investment companies, investment advisers, pooled investment vehicles, money transmitting businesses, and all entities registered with the [ORGANIZATION]8, among others. The justification for the exemption of entities that have both physical operations and at least 20 employees in [PERSON] is that those entities physical [PERSON] presence will make it easy for [PERSON] law enforcement to discover those entities true owners. Like other exemptions in the bill, this exemption should be narrowly construed to exclude entities that do not have an easily located physical presence in [PERSON], do not have multiple employees physically present on an ongoing basis in [PERSON], or use strategies that make it difficult for [PERSON] law enforcement to contact their workforce or discover the names of their beneficial owners. This exemption should be subject to continuous, careful review by [ORGANIZATION]0 under the new 31 [PERSON].C 5336i to detect and prevent its misuse. Extending the disclosure exemption to subsidiaries whose ownership interests are owned or controlled by one or more of certain identified exempt entities is, again, intended to be interpreted as narrowly as possible to exclude subsidiaries that never disclose their true owners to the federal government. The exemption is intended to apply only to subsidiaries that are wholly owned or controlled by one or more of the exempt categories of entities thats why the provision does not contain any reference to the 25 ownership figure that appears in the definition of beneficial owner. [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]0, [ORGANIZATION]9, [ORGANIZATION]8, [ORGANIZATION]1, [ORGANIZATION]3, and other federal regulators should review their filing requirements to ensure that the entities that report to them, such as banks, publicly traded corporations, securities dealers, exchange operators, or commodity brokers, include requirements to disclose the subsidiaries they wholly own or control. This exemption, like others, should be subject to continuous, careful review by [ORGANIZATION]0 under the new 31 [PERSON].C 5336i to detect and prevent its misuse. For their part, [ORGANIZATION]6 identifiers are intended to simplify beneficial ownership disclosures by eliminating spelling and naming issues that can cause confusion or mistakes related to the precise individuals or entities in an ownership chain. [PERSON] S7312 [ORGANIZATION]6 should design rules that will encourage both individuals and entities to obtain and use [ORGANIZATION]6 identifiers in their beneficial ownership disclosures. When assigning [ORGANIZATION]6 identifiers to entities, [ORGANIZATION]6 should first ensure that the entity has already disclosed its beneficial ownership information to [ORGANIZATION]6. An entity that has not disclosed its beneficial ownership information to [ORGANIZATION]6 does not qualify and should not be granted a [ORGANIZATION]6 identifier. It is critical that, from the beginning, [ORGANIZATION]6 issue rules that ensure only one identifying number is assigned to each individual and to each entity, including all successors to a specific entity. [ORGANIZATION]6 should also establish mechanisms to detect and correct any procedure or database field that may lead to the same individual or entity possessing or using more than one [ORGANIZATION]6 identifier. Chairman [PERSON]01 and I agreed two [PERSON] ago that we must get this done in this [ORGANIZATION]--we must finally enact sweeping legislation to require complete ownership information--not of front men and women, not of those forming companies on behalf of those who will pull the strings from behind the curtain--but of the actual owners of companies to be available to appropriate law enforcement, intelligence and national security officials in our government who need it to combat crime. This bill lays out a system to do that simply, efficiently and effectively, without unduly burdening small businesses or others, and while providing extensive protections for the information. In [PERSON], that information is included in a public database. This approach is different, imposing some limits on who will have access, and under what circumstances. For example, it provides that federal agency heads or their designees--and agencies can extend that delegation as far down in their organizational chain as they like--can provide access to the database to appropriate law enforcement authorities once per investigation, so they do not need to keep repeating that authorization for the same investigation. And those delegations can be made on a bulk basis, so groups or classes of employees can be authorized to access the data as needed. For ORG2, local or tribal law enforcement, they must get approval by a tribal, local, or state [STREET] of competent jurisdiction, which need not be a judge--it can include an officer of the [STREET] like a magistrate, [STREET] clerk or other administrative officer. While I saw no reason to treat federal, state and local law enforcement officials differently, my Republican colleagues insisted on this differential treatment, and I am hopeful that the flexibility we have built in should make it workable. It is far more workable than the scheme some had pushed, to require approval by a federal judge each time law enforcement wanted to access the database--an approach which would have gutted the bill, tied up our federal courts, and effectively rendered it inaccessible to state and local law enforcement. But the key here is a robust, functional and effective database at [ORGANIZATION]6 to house this information and make it readily available. [ORGANIZATION]6 should take immediate steps to create the new database needed to contain beneficial ownership information. It should use state of the art technology, procedures, and safeguards to ensure the database is secure, easy to search, easy to audit, and easy to correct and update. [ORGANIZATION]6 should use its new hiring authority to hire the information technology specialists needed to create the new beneficial ownership database. In designing the database, [ORGANIZATION]6 should survey other beneficial ownership databases to determine their best features and design, and create a structure that secures the data as required by law. [ORGANIZATION]6 should ensure that federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement can access the beneficial ownership database without excessive delays or red tape in a manner modeled after its existing systems providing law enforcement access to databases containing currency transaction and suspicious activity report information. [ORGANIZATION]6 should allow federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement to access the beneficial ownership data for both criminal and civil purposes, including law enforcement activities designed to combat terrorism, money laundering, trafficking, corruption, evasion of sanctions, noncompliance with tax law, fraud, counterfeit goods, market manipulation, insider trading, consumer abuse, cybercrime, election interference, and other types of criminal and civil wrongdoing. [ORGANIZATION]6 should also provide appropriate access to beneficial ownership data for foreign law enforcement requesting the information for criminal or civil purposes, including appropriate requests made by a prosecutor, judge, foreign central authority, or competent authority in a foreign jurisdiction, keeping in mind that [PERSON] law enforcement will be seeking similar information from those same foreign law enforcement agencies on a reciprocal basis. [ORGANIZATION]6 should endeavor to design a system that will provide appropriate beneficial ownership information to foreign law enforcement without excessive delays or red tape. As part of its implementation effort, [ORGANIZATION]6 should take immediate steps to work with states and [ORGANIZATION]3n Tribes to determine how to confirm that all covered entities formed or administered by those states or tribes actually file and update the beneficial ownership information required by law. We expect [ORGANIZATION]6 to include any resulting procedures or audits in the rule implementing the law. [ORGANIZATION]6 should also include appropriate provisions in the implementing rule requiring federal, state, and tribal agencies to cooperate with its efforts to ensure an accurate, complete, and highly useful database of beneficial information and to provide notice of the laws beneficial ownership transparency obligations, as required by the new law. The [ORGANIZATION]0 [ORGANIZATION] should take immediate steps to establish a process to accept, store, and analyze information provided by a federal, state, local or tribal agency, foreign government, financial institution, reporting company, civil society group, the public, or others in the form of comments or complaints related to how [ORGANIZATION]6 provides notification of the laws beneficial ownership transparency requirements, how [ORGANIZATION]6 collects and stores beneficial ownership information, or regarding the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the information in the [ORGANIZATION]6 beneficial ownership database. As part of that process, the [ORGANIZATION]0 [ORGANIZATION] should establish procedures that will enable comments or complaints identifying false, out-of-date, or incomplete beneficial ownership information in the database or providing correct, up-to-date, or complete beneficial ownership information in the database promptly to reach the [ORGANIZATION]6 personnel charged with ensuring the databases accuracy, completeness, and timeliness. In addition, the [ORGANIZATION]0 [ORGANIZATION] should establish a procedure to conduct periodic audits to determine the extent to which such information actually reached the proper [ORGANIZATION]6 personnel, was logged, stored, and analyzed, led to changes in the database, and actually improved the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the beneficial ownership database. In response to the bill, [ORGANIZATION] should take immediate steps to revise [ORGANIZATION] to require covered federal contractors and subcontractors, at an early stage in the federal procurement process, to disclose to the federal government in writing, and to update over time, information on their beneficial owners. To carry out this provision in the law, the Administrator should work with [ORGANIZATION]5 to add a beneficial ownership disclosure requirement to the database authorizing entities to bid on federal contracts. At the same time it is developing regulations to implement the new law, [ORGANIZATION]6 should simultaneously revise the existing customer due diligence rule to bring it into harmony with the new law and all proposed regulations. In doing so, [ORGANIZATION]6 should carefully evaluate the existing customer due diligence rule and preserve provisions that do not conflict with the new law. Among other changes, the revised customer due diligence rule must use the new definition of beneficial owner established in the law. [ORGANIZATION]0 and [PERSON] S7313 [ORGANIZATION]6 should create a transition period for financial institutions to implement the new beneficial ownership requirements. Lastly, [ORGANIZATION]6 should also take steps to establish procedures as needed to administer the revised customer due diligence rule effectively. Updating and strengthening our [ORGANIZATION] and beneficial ownership laws will give us a [LOCATION]50 system to combat these crimes. I guarantee you criminals have long been revising, adjusting and amending their tactics to circumvent our current laws. We must get ahead of them, and stay ahead of them. This bill will enable us to do that. I urge my colleagues to support the conference report and this important measure. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from [ORGANIZATION]8."

PERSON32. But PERSON33 stressed the move wasnt because of any individuals or specific threats. There is nothing specific that has happened that I am aware of, period, PERSON33 said.

But critics of the law counter that part of it requiring felons to pay fees and costs to be eligible to have voting rights restored contradicts what Floridians thought they were approving last [PERSON]. In one of the briefs filed [PERSON]6 in opposition to the state law, [ORGANIZATION]9 said that costs and fees are categorically not terms of sentence because they bear none of the hallmarks of sentencing, in part because they are non-punitive and simply serve to compensate the government for the costs of administering criminal justice.

An expansion bill was added to the ORG38 floor calendar at the same time as the budget override veto. The issues were tied together Gov.

[ORGANIZATION] office eviction of ORGDATE22 members shows nothing is safe from political warfare25 via ORG32 [ORGANIZATION] luck trying to make sense of the political squabble between [ORGANIZATION] representatives and [ORGANIZATION] over an office space. Staffs for GPE29 Reps. PERSON82 and [ORGANIZATION], both Democrats, were given free, part-time office space at the [PERSON]8 [ORGANIZATION] [INSTITUTION] at [LOCATION]0.

[PERSON] PERSON90s record of getting things done speaks for itself, PERSON96 said in a statement. He has always put the American people above party lines and will continue to as President. PERSON90 has won quite a bit of support from [ORGANIZATION]s Democratic establishment, including former GPE29 Sen. [PERSON] and former GPE29 Senator and Gov. PERSON103.

My cousin committed suicide by a gun when we were 16 [LOCATION]DATEDATE25 old, PERSON107 said in a statement announcing her endorsement. The fact that PERSON108 is willing to remove the stigma in his administration and appoint someone who will normalize the conversation about suicide and put forth initiatives that could possibly aid someone else in seeking help means a lot to me. In [ORGANIZATION]1, PERSON106 proposed a plan aimed at cutting down on gun suicides. That plan included pushing safe storage laws, appointing a federal coordinator to address the issue, and extreme risk laws to remove guns from individuals showing suicide risk factors.

The re-engagement in [PERSON]5 where the [PERSON]4 senator held a 17-stop bus tour in [ORGANIZATION]3 but hasnt returned since is part of a broader acknowledgment inside the campaign that she hasnt been in the early states enough.

In delivering his alarming, existentially unsettling message of automation and artificial intelligence wreaking havoc on [LOCATION] economic, emotional and social well-being, he cracks jokes. He laughs easily, and those around him, and who come to see him, end up laughing a lot, too. Its not that [ORGANIZATION] doing stump-speech stand-up. Its more a certain nonchalant whimsy that leavens what he says and does. Hes attracting support from an unorthodox jumble of citizens, from a host of top technologists, but from penitent PERSON100 voters, too.

Thats not new the outfit colored [ORGANIZATION] pink when it issues its first DATE31 map in [ORGANIZATION]4. But after three statewide races in [ORGANIZATION] went to recount, the PERSON116 ranking still stuns with its stubbornness. Interestingly, the map appears somewhat foreboding for PERSON100. The incumbent Republican counts 248 electoral votes on the map, including [ORGANIZATION]s 29 votes. The map puts Democrats, who have yet to set a contentious nomination process, on equal footing.

baltimore,2018-10-11T00:00:00Z,Impact News Service,The Baltimore Sun,"homeless, homelessness",EXECUTIVE CALENDAR ([ORGANIZATION]),"The Senator from [ORGANIZATION]. S. [DATE] Mr. [PERSON]. Mr. President, I rise to convey my strong support for the [PERSON]1s Water Infrastructure Act, which passed [ORGANIZATION] earlier [LOCATION]. With communities throughout [ORGANIZATION] and the country working to improve the quality of their drinking water, bracing for rising seas and more intense storms, and seeking to be more competitive in the global economy, this legislative package will provide welcome relief and support for critical infrastructure. I have long focused on providing resources needed to improve the maritime linchpin of my [PERSON] economy FAC0. But this economic engine needs direct [ORGANIZATION] funding to fire on all cylinders, especially as we transition to a new, supersized shipping era. DATE0, FAC1 completed an expansion project that allows bigger vessels, called [ORGANIZATION] ships, to pass through the canal. These ships, which are the length of aircraft carriers and can carry more than three times as much cargo as their competitors, are too large to dock at FAC0 [LOCATION]. That is why, in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] water resources bill, I fought to authorize 216 million in [ORGANIZATION] funding for the FAC0 improvement project, which will deepen the [INSTITUTION] to accommodate those [ORGANIZATION] ships. I am pleased that my provision dedicating an additional 16 million to this crucial project was included in the [ORGANIZATION] water resources bill. The FAC0 improvement project is projected to double the harbors container volume, protect and grow 7,000 jobs, and generate 4.6 billion in economic activity throughout the [ORGANIZATION] region. It is a simple formula Larger ships mean more cargo, more cargo means more commerce, and more commerce means more jobs for [ORGANIZATION] and the [ORGANIZATION]6 of [ORGANIZATION]. I am pleased that the ORG2 has to date allocated 91 million of funding to this critical project thus far, but deepening the [INSTITUTION] alone does not ensure that the [INSTITUTION] of [ORGANIZATION] can accommodate these new, gargantuan giants of the seas. We must also deepen the berths, the area where the ships dock. That is why I am proud to secure a provision in this bill that will allow the [INSTITUTION] to construct more expansive berths, and I am pleased to help secure [ORGANIZATION] S6749 a 42 million [ORGANIZATION] grant to expand these berths. By no means is FAC0 the only coastal gem in [ORGANIZATION]. In [DATE], we will be celebrating the 400th anniversary of the voyage of the [ORGANIZATION] and the settlement at GPE3, but the celebration wont be complete if the ships cant get into and out of GPE3 [INSTITUTION]. Regrettably, GPE3 [INSTITUTION] has filled up with so much sand that ships are having trouble navigating--including the centerpiece of the celebration, the newly restored [ORGANIZATION] II. That is why I secured a provision in this bill requiring the ORG2 to dredge this important landmark for the 400th anniversary. DATE5, I helped secure 14.5 million needed to ensure that this hallmark of [PERSON]1n history is swiftly deepened. With this statutory requirement and funding, GPE3 [INSTITUTION] will be able to host a great birth[ORGANIZATION]8 party in [DATE]--one that [PERSON]1ns from all corners of the country and people from around the world are going to attend. But those [LOCATION] [ORGANIZATION]6rs living on [ORGANIZATION] will most likely experience a little traffic on the [STREET] to the event because [ORGANIZATION] is only accessible by two bridges, which span the [ORGANIZATION] Canal. If [ORGANIZATION] is the arm of [ORGANIZATION], then these two bridges are the vital arteries delivering the islands lifeblood. The strength of those two bridges will determine the strength of the islands economy and health and well-being. Regrettably, these two [ORGANIZATION] bridges, which are owned by the [ORGANIZATION] ORG2, are structurally deficient. That is a problem for businesses that need an uninterrupted flow of commerce and residents who must have a safe means of evacuation in the event of an emergency. Imagine if there were an accident at FAC5 or the equivalent of a Hurricane [PERSON]ia. These two bridges are the only [STREET] for many [ORGANIZATION] residents to escape to safety. I am proud that this bill includes my provision directing the ORG2 to replace these critical evacuation routes, helping preserve the very safety of island residents. In a time of emergency, [ORGANIZATION] residents shouldnt have to think twice about the best [STREET] to get their families to safety. The bill also includes legislation that I have authored to help protect consumers from unjust and unreasonable increases in their electricity rates. Right [LOCATION]54, if the [ORGANIZATION] Energy Regulatory Commission has a vacancy--as is currently the case--and deadlocks 2 to 2 on whether to improve a rate increase, the increase goes forward. To make matters worse, the public cant even challenge a decision in this circumstance. That is exactly what happened in [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION], leading to a 2 billion increase for our regions consumers. My legislation would fix that by allowing the public to bring a challenge when [ORGANIZATION] deadlocks, as they can for every other [ORGANIZATION] decision. In sports, a tie isnt a loss, and the Fair RATES Act will ensure that a tie at [ORGANIZATION] wont mean consumers lose with higher electricity rates. We must ensure that ratepayers are protected from unjust and unreasonable increases in energy prices. The legislation will help return the power to the people when it comes to energy prices by providing an outlet for consumers to challenge rate increases. I thank Senators [PERSON] and PERSON2 for working with me to move this legislation forward, and I thank my great partner in [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]man PERSON3, for his tireless work to address this issue and to protect consumers. I am pleased that this legislation contains several other key provisions that increase the funding caps for three coastal protection programs, allowing the towns of GPE4, [PERSON], and GPE6 to implement larger beach-nourishment projects--pumping sand onto the beach--to protect their communities reevaluate the LOC2 environmental restoration project to pave the [STREET] for reauthorizing this crucial project permit the town of GPE6 to use sand pumped from the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] Canal that otherwise would be dumped in the ocean to fortify their town from rising seas ensure that the ORG2 takes on all the costs to repair the town of GPE6s beaches, which experience severe erosion due to the jetties at the mouth of [ORGANIZATION] Canal and require the ORG7 to appoint liaisons to minority, [PERSON], and low-income communities so these disenfranchised groups can have better access to the resources and tools provided by the [ORGANIZATION] Government to improve the quality of our ORG9 drinking water. From fortifying our communities, to dealing with the [ORGANIZATION] impacts of climate change, to eradicating the environmental contaminants of DATE8 from our water infrastructure, this legislation package will provide the funding and direction needed to help modernize the [LOCATION] water infrastructure. I thank Chairman [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] Member [PERSON] for working with me on this important legislation. I was proud to vote in favor of [PERSON]1s Water Infrastructure Act [LOCATION]. It is something that I think is going to work very successfully for the [ORGANIZATION]6 of [ORGANIZATION]. It is something that, in my opinion, is the quintessential example of how bipartisanship should, in fact, animate the legislative process in this body. With that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant [PERSON] proceeded to call the roll. Ms. [PERSON]. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. [PERSON]. 63 Ms. [PERSON]. Mr. President, just a little bit ago, [TIME], we had a matter before the [ORGANIZATION]0 relating to [PERSON]. 63. This was a resolution of disapproval, which would have worked to disapprove of the rule that was issued jointly by the [ORGANIZATION]1, [ORGANIZATION]2, and [ORGANIZATION]3 regarding these short-term, limited duration insurance plans. I had hoped, actually, to have an opportunity to speak to this prior to the vote but was not able to. I want to take just a couple of minutes [TIME] to weigh in on this issue from an [LOCATION] perspective. I think there have been some suggestions that with this rule in [STREET], those of us who care about protecting those with preexisting conditions, somehow or another, are taking these protections away. I have weighed this carefully. In fairness, I think some of the arguments that have been made are, perhaps, not quite as clear cut as would be suggested and, perhaps, certainly, in a [ORGANIZATION]6 like mine, where we still have the highest healthcare costs in the country and some of the highest costs for coverage in the country. I think Members here in the [ORGANIZATION]0 k[LOCATION]54 full well that while I have opposed many aspects of the Affordable Care Act, I have supported and have strongly supported certain parts of it as well. Again, one of those things that I feel very strongly about is the need to ensure that we protect those who have preexisting conditions. That is a debate that, I think, is ongoing in other places as well. Yet I want to make clear that, certainly, my vote [TIME] is in no [STREET] meant to erode or undermine where I am coming from when it comes to preexisting conditions. Back to the situation that we face in GPE7, as I mentioned, we are the highest in terms of the cost of care and the highest in terms of the cost of coverage, and we are still one of those [PERSON] that has but one insurer on the exchange in GPE7. So our options are, really, pretty limited. As I am speaking to individuals about what they are hoping for when it comes to coverage, they are looking for additional options, but they are looking for affordable options as well. It is true--it is absolutely true--that these short-term plans do not offer as much or, certainly, may not offer as much in the [STREET] of coverage as those plans that are offered on the individual exchanges. I understand that, but I have had to come down on this issue on the side of more choice for consumers and more options being a good thing for consumers. In GPE7, our population, as one k[LOCATION]54s, is relatively small. We have about 720,000 people in the whole [ORGANIZATION]6, but we are talking about 18,000 people, give or take, who are enrolled on the individual exchanges [PERSON]. The [ORGANIZATION] S6750 universe here is 18,000 people when we are talking about the exchanges. In [LOCATION]7 [ORGANIZATION], which was [LOCATION]1 about which the [ORGANIZATION]4 can give us information, there were about 15,000 people who chose to pay the individual mandate penalty rather than to buy the insurance. Think about what that means. They are weighing this, and they are saying I would rather pay a fine, pay that penalty. It is not that I dont want the insurance, but I cannot afford it. So you had 18,000 people on the individual exchanges, and 15,000 people chose to pay the individual mandate penalty rather than buy the insurance. That is because, if an [LOCATION] does not get the subsidy--and a pretty heavy subsidy--the exchange plans just arent affordable. Even though you want to have that coverage--you want that insurance--wanting it doesnt necessarily get it to you if you cannot afford it. The average premium for [LOCATION]2--this is according to [ORGANIZATION]5 data--is [DATE]. What am I getting from constituents, from folks who are writing in to me and calling me? They are telling me what they are paying for their plans. For a family of four, the premium was over 2,000 a month, with a 7,500 deductible. Think about what that actually means for this family, for folks with those kinds of bills, who, basically, only have catastrophic coverage, as it is. Again, you think about the number of folks on the individual exchanges, and you think about those who choose not to pay the fines. You look at the numbers of those who receive the subsidies in the [ORGANIZATION]6 of GPE7, which is quite considerable. We also have about 10,000 or so [LOCATION]s--this is according to the [ORGANIZATION]6 division of insurance--who have enrolled in healthcare sharing ministries. This is yet another option for people out there. A significant number has turned to these healthcare sharing ministries, and these folks have managed to avoid the penalty in [LOCATION]3. In fairness, some of the ministry plans do not provide much in the [STREET] of coverage, but it is an indicator of what people feel they have to do in the face of just very, very high-cost plans. I understand where those who oppose this rule are coming from, and I have had good, long conversations about this. I guess I would ask that they turn to the realities that we are facing in a [ORGANIZATION]6 like GPE7 and just appreciate where people are coming from when you think about the 15,000 [LOCATION]s who have chosen not to buy insurance over [LOCATION]4 because it has been too expensive, but they want to have something they can afford. These short-term plans, while not ideal--I am not suggesting that they are--are an option for them to consider. What about the people who dont get subsidies and are paying over 50,000 per [ORGANIZATION]3 before their insurance covers anything? That too is a situation in which they are looking for alternatives. So perhaps these short-term plans could be a viable option. For the 10,000-some-odd people who are currently using a sharing ministry, again, these types of plans could be an alternative. For the people who may choose to drop off the individual exchanges [LOCATION]5, these plans could be a path forward for some having some level of coverage. Again, I am not saying that this is perfect, and I am not saying that this is ideal. I am saying it offers a limited option in a [STREET] in which we have very few affordable options to turn to. Another reason these shorter term plans are helpful for us and why I have heard from so many [LOCATION]s on this is that we are a [ORGANIZATION]6 in which our employment base is very, very seasonal. You have a construction industry, but it is not like it is back here. Construction is, maybe, [LOCATION]6 out of [LOCATION]7--longer in some parts of the [ORGANIZATION]6 and shorter in other parts of the [ORGANIZATION]6. Yet you have a seasonal job. Our fishing industry is a great example. If you are working in the processing end of fishing, it may be [LOCATION]8. If you are working as a crabber, it may be [LOCATION]9. If you are working on a tender up in [ORGANIZATION], it may be [ORGANIZATION]0 [ORGANIZATION]1. Then we have [ORGANIZATION]2. Again, we would like to think that we can entice you all to come up [ORGANIZATION]3 round, but quite honestly, it too is very, very seasonal. So we need to have some level of flexibility for those many, many [LOCATION]s who move between many of these seasonal employment opportunities. Under the prior rule, a short-term insurance plan could only last for [LOCATION]8. That is not going to help out, say, those in the fishing or in the tourism industry or, again, in so many of these areas in which you need longer term coverage but you dont need a full [ORGANIZATION]3. So flexibility is something that people have been asking for as well. Where that sweet spot is, I am not sure. I am telling you that, for us, [LOCATION]8 doesnt make it. Maybe 3 [ORGANIZATION]3s is too long. Maybe we do need to look at that. I happen to think that we do, but that is an area that is open for review. The last point I would make is that I think we have to have some trust in both our [PERSON] as regulators and in individuals, the consumers. The rule that we were speaking about [TIME] really does allow [PERSON] to have a great deal of leeway in regulating at the local level. We are seeing that among many of the [PERSON]. I had a long conversation with our director of insurance up in the [ORGANIZATION]6 of GPE7. We talked about where our [ORGANIZATION]6 might take this and looked again at, perhaps, the length of these short-term, limited duration plans and how they might be regulated. Also, there is the transparency side of this, and this is something that concerns me. Some of the things we have heard are that people have bought these less expensive plans, these shorter term plans, and then, when they need them the most, they realize the coverage doesnt take care of them. That is also not a [STREET] we want anyone to be. Making sure that there is a level of transparency, that there is a level of disclosure that is real and not just the tiny boilerplate that nobody can understand--it has to be, again, transparent in that [STREET]. I think this is one of those areas where trusting in our laboratories of democracy, which are our [PERSON], to tailor plans that fit a [ORGANIZATION]6 well should not be an action that we here in the [ORGANIZATION]0 are so unwilling to take. As we look to how we do more in this [ORGANIZATION] and how we do more to help those for whom healthcare--the cost of healthcare and access to healthcare--is still their No. 1 issue, still the No. 1 subject of discussion, I have come to speak on this particular issue [LOCATION] because there are maybe 25,000 people in my [ORGANIZATION]6 who could see some benefit from these types of plans being available and also because I believe that trusting the regulators, certainly in my [ORGANIZATION]6, to handle the plans intelligently is an important part of how we move forward as well. I wanted to put that on the record [LOCATION] following the discussion from earlier [TIME] and the vote at [TIME]. [ORGANIZATION] President, I want to transition really quickly and just take [TIME] because [ORGANIZATION]6, as we all k[LOCATION]54, was a very difficult time in the [ORGANIZATION]0 as we processed the nomination of Judge [PERSON] to serve on [ORGANIZATION]7. That vote has concluded. Judge [PERSON] is [LOCATION]54 [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON], and I truly wish him all the best as he begins his new term on the highest [STREET] in the land. But there is a residue--I dont k[LOCATION]54 if it is a residue. I dont k[LOCATION]54 how we make sure we are able to move forward after difficult votes that divide us all and work to come back together. I am going to speak very directly about my friend who sits right here next to me on the [ORGANIZATION]0 floor. She and I went through, probably, a similar deliberative process. It was probably the same as everybody else here on the floor, but we perhaps shared more discussion about it than I did with other colleagues. At the end of [ORGANIZATION]8, we came down on different sides, but both of us--both of us--agonized over the decision and the process. She is [LOCATION]54 enduring an active campaign against her. It is not just an active campaign against her, but there are protests at her home [ORGANIZATION]7, and she cannot travel without a police escort. I made comments as I prepared for the final vote [ORGANIZATION]6. I said We are better than this. We have to set the example here. I am really touched that after I had taken a hard vote within my caucus, [ORGANIZATION] S6751 there are some who are notably angry at me. But we are working together on the next issue of [ORGANIZATION]8, and we are moving forward. We need to set that example in this body because if we dont set it here, I dont k[LOCATION]54 how we can expect anyone on the outside to follow us. There is a need for civility. It is a hard time for us, but I would urge us all to choose our words carefully. Dont be afraid to speak with kindness toward one another. Dont be afraid to call out the good in somebody else, even though you have voted against them. We are better than what we are seeing right [LOCATION]54. I am smiling only because I feel I should recommend that my colleagues watch a movie, a documentary. I dont do that often, but after the vote on [ORGANIZATION]9, I just, by chance, picked up a DVD that had been sent to me. It is a documentary about the life and career of PERSON9--Mister [PERSON]0--Wont You Be My Neighbor? I figured I needed something kind of calming for [TIME]. It is OK to be good to one another. It is OK to accept people for who they are. It is OK to just find the good. With that, Mr. President, I thank you for allowing me to speak a little bit from the heart. I would ask us to be civil with one another [LOCATION]54, not civil when the next election comes. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr. [PERSON]1. The clerk will call the roll. The [PERSON] proceeded to call the roll. Mr. [PERSON]2. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. [PERSON]2. Mr. President, I will oppose the pending nomination of [PERSON]3 to be the Assistant Attorney General in charge of [ORGANIZATION]8 [ORGANIZATION]9 Division. This is the division that leads [ORGANIZATION] enforcement of environmental laws and regulations. Mr. [PERSON]4 is not the right person for that job. In [ORGANIZATION], he said the science of climate change is contestable. He represented ORG21 in litigation over the [PERSON] explosion and oil spill. He has represented ORG22 and other industry groups in challenging ORG7 greenhouse gas regulations. He is a favorite of the [ORGANIZATION]ist Society, having chaired that groups environmental law and practice group. But his nomination is strongly opposed by groups that care about protecting the environment. [PERSON] called him an outspoken opponent of environmental and public health protection. ORG25 described him as an enemy of the environment. He is exactly the wrong person to be in this job of enforcing regulations to protect our environment. Just during [ORGANIZATION]0, the [ORGANIZATION] put out an alert to all of the members around the world. We are going to pay dearly for this current administrations decision to remove ourselves from the Paris Agreement, where literally every country on [ORGANIZATION] agreed to try to do something to clean up the mess of our environment and leave our children a better [STREET] to live. We decided, under President [PERSON]5, to be the only GPE84 to step away from it. Why? What in the world were we thinking? Can you believe that things that are happening that are easily documented can be ignored? Do you see the flooding that is going on [LOCATION]54 in [LOCATION] on a regular basis? That is just 1 of 1,000 different examples. If we dont accept responsibility in our generation to make this a better world, shame on us. We want to leave our kids a better world, but for goodness sake, do we have the political courage to do it? Will we be able to say to the President You are just wrong. We have to work together with nations around the world. The United [PERSON] should be a leader, not an apologist. The President said he wants to make [PERSON]1 first. How about [PERSON]1 first when it comes to cleaning up the environment? There is nothing wrong with that leadership. It is something we should be proud of. This man, [PERSON]3, who is aspiring to be the Assistant Attorney General, just doesnt buy into what I just said, and I cant support him as a result. S. [DATE] Mr. President, the [ORGANIZATION]1 WRDA bill--[ORGANIZATION]--that we are considering on the floor [ORGANIZATION]2 is an important step in modernizing our ORG9 water infrastructure and ensuring access to clean drinking water. It goes back to my earlier comment. If we are talking about the environment, one of the first things people say is, I want safe drinking water for myself and my family. Next to that, I want to be able to breathe in air that is not going to make me sick or hurt any member of my family. Our ORG9 infrastructure is aging and in need of significant investment. Last [ORGANIZATION]3, the [PERSON]1n [ORGANIZATION] gave our ORG9 levees, inland waterways, and drinking water infrastructure a D rating in terms of its infrastructure report card. They estimate that 80 billion is needed over [ORGANIZATION]4 to improve our ORG9 levees--80 billion. They also estimate that 4.9 billion is needed over the next 2 [ORGANIZATION]3s to maintain our inland waterways--4.9 billion-- and 1 trillion is needed over the next 25 [ORGANIZATION]3s to expand our drinking water infrastructure. These are massive numbers, and they are going to require sustained and significant [ORGANIZATION] investment if we are ever going to reach these goals. This bill--the WRDA bill--is a step in the right direction. It authorizes 6.1 billion in funding for the [ORGANIZATION] ORG2 flood control, navigation, and ecosystem restoration projects around the country. These are critical projects in every [ORGANIZATION]6. I just went down [ORGANIZATION]7 with Senator [PERSON]6 to [PERSON]. [ORGANIZATION] that has been under construction for [ORGANIZATION]8 is finally completed. It is an amazing investment. It is the most expensive civil infrastructure project in our ORG9 history, and it is an indication of the kind of investment that is necessary if we are going to try to tame rivers like [PERSON]. There are critical projects like that in every [ORGANIZATION]6. They improve our inland waterways to help deliver 600 million in goods and 60 percent of our grain imports [PERSON]. If we want the United [PERSON] to literally lead the world--if we want [PERSON]1 first--for goodness sake, we need to be first in investing in our infrastructure. These projects maintain levees and build reservoirs that protect millions of people and an estimated 1.3 trillion in property, and they protect the environment, they restore wetlands, and they prevent the spread of invasive species. I am especially proud that this bill includes an important cost share change for the future operations and maintenance costs at FAC8 in my [ORGANIZATION]6 of [PERSON]3. I worked with Senator [PERSON]7 on this project. The [ORGANIZATION] project is integral to ensuring that invasive [ORGANIZATION]9n carp never spread to [ORGANIZATION]. Knock on wood. We have held up that carp from going into [ORGANIZATION] and, in doing so, we have preserved an important part of the fisheries and the lake itself. I want to continue those efforts, if not redouble them. While I am proud to support passage of this authorizing bill, I also implore my colleagues to remember that unless we are willing to work together--Republicans and Democrats--to provide these authorized projects with consistent and increased appropriations [PERSON], then we are sending out press releases and not even getting the job half done. Let me say it another [STREET] It is not enough to go home and take credit for passing the WRDA bill, which is an authorization bill, if you arent also willing to pass an appropriations bill that actually provides the money to break ground on these projects. An authorization bill is just that It gives you permission to do a project, but then you need to go to the spending bill--the appropriations bill--to come up with the money to actually achieve it. Listen to this number. I want to make this part of the record as we debate water resources and infrastructure. An analysis by the ORG29 newspaper from earlier this [ORGANIZATION]3 found that while [ORGANIZATION] has authorized more than 25 billion toward [ORGANIZATION] ORG2 projects in [DATE]0 billion in [DATE]1--[ORGANIZATION] has [ORGANIZATION] S6752 only appropriated 689 million. So 25 billion authorized, 689 million appropriated. What percentage of money have we actually come up with to finish these projects? We have come up with only 689 million out of 25 billion--2.7 percent. We send out all of these press releases congratulating ourselves about projects that are never going to happen. We send out the releases and say This is going to be great for future generations. We are not doing it. We are not investing in [PERSON]1. Slow and inconsistent [ORGANIZATION] funding for these projects results in [ORGANIZATION]3s of added delay and millions in added costs. Instead of funding new projects, we have to spend more on ongoing projects because [ORGANIZATION] just doesnt get its act together--Democrats and Republicans. I am proud of the work of ORG30 on which I have been honored to serve. Both sides of the aisle do work to get their job done in record time and ensure the ORG2 has stable funding for the next fiscal [ORGANIZATION]3, but this [ORGANIZATION]3s appropriations process should not be unusual. Unless we as a [ORGANIZATION] commit every [ORGANIZATION]3 to getting our budget work done and appropriating these [ORGANIZATION] dollars, we will never get ahead on investing in our infrastructure. Our competitors like [PERSON]4 and others around the world are making massive investments in infrastructure not just in their own country but in other countries that are teaming up with them, with an economic vision for the future. What is our goal? What are we trying to achieve right here in the United [PERSON], and how are we working to build our economy and create good-paying jobs for the future? Our ORG9 water infrastructure is in need of significant investment. The good bill we are considering [LOCATION] is just a step in the right direction, but an authorization bill without appropriation is just an empty press release. I hope we can work together to ensure funding gets appropriated [PERSON] to actually complete these important projects. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The [PERSON] proceeded to call the roll. Mr. [PERSON]8. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr. [PERSON]9. Without objection, it is so ordered. Remembering PERSON20 Mr. [PERSON]8. Mr. President, I regret to inform our colleagues of the death of PERSON21, who died on [DATE]5, succumbing to cancer at [DATE]6. Senator [PERSON] was one of the most outspoken progressive Democrats in this body. He was born to privilege. His father was a Democratic Senator from the [ORGANIZATION]6 of [PERSON]8--a conservative Democratic Senator. His grandfather was one of our first Ambassadors to [PERSON]6. His paternal grandfather married PERSON23, who built ORG31, which most of us k[LOCATION]54 is in [PERSON]7. He came from a family of great privilege. Yet he was k[LOCATION]54n in [PERSON]8 as a person of the people, representing the people of our [ORGANIZATION]6. His first elected office was president of the Young Democrats of [PERSON]8. From there, he became a member of the [PERSON]8 [ORGANIZATION]1 of [LOCATION], where he fought the establishment, took on the network in [PERSON]9, and investigated the savings and loan situation in our [ORGANIZATION]6. He really shined a lot of light on what was happening in abuses in that industry. He was chosen by then-Senator PERSON3 to head up his campaign for President. PERSON21 handled his campaign in [PERSON]8 for President and helped in other primaries around the GPE84, leading to President [PERSON] election as President of the United [PERSON]. President PERSON3 asked him to serve as the [ORGANIZATION]0 attorney for [PERSON]8, and Senator [PERSON] served as the [ORGANIZATION]0 attorney. He was k[LOCATION]54n for his independence at the [ORGANIZATION]0 Attorneys Office. He pursued white collar crime and political corruption. He indicted and convicted a former Member of [ORGANIZATION], as well as the speaker of the [PERSON]8 [ORGANIZATION]1 of [LOCATION]. He recruited young talent to his office in the [ORGANIZATION]0 Attorneys Office, including PERSON25, who went on to become the Attorney General of the United [PERSON], and PERSON26, who continued to become the attorney general for the [ORGANIZATION]6 of [PERSON]8. In [DATE]7 he ran and was elected to the [ORGANIZATION]0 [ORGANIZATION]0. He worked on progressive causes, including the Voting Rights Act, which he helped to get enacted under President PERSON27, and also gun safety legislation. After leaving the [ORGANIZATION]0 after one term, he continued to be extremely active in our community. He was best k[LOCATION]54n, I believe, for his work at the University of [PERSON]8. He served three terms on the board of regents of the University of [PERSON]8 system, giving back to the school where he graduated from both undergraduate and law school, and he was k[LOCATION]54n as one of the most aggressive people in the reform of our University of [PERSON]8 System and also in the independence of the university hospital. On a personal note, let me tell you that he helped with my election to the [ORGANIZATION]0 [ORGANIZATION]0 12 [ORGANIZATION]3s ago and gave me a great deal of support and friendship and was an adviser and role model for me. I remember his being here when I took the oath of office as a Senator, walking me down the aisle. I had a great deal of pride that he was with me. He is going to be missed by all of us--just an incredible person, a person who put his principles over practical politics. It may have cost him an election, but he did what he thought was right. I can tell you that we are all proud of his service to the people of [PERSON]8 and our GPE84. Mr. President, we will miss this man, who was determined to help bend the arc of the moral universe toward justice as fast as possible. PERSON21 was born as PERSON28 in [ORGANIZATION]1, [ORGANIZATION]2, on [DATE]9 to PERSON29 of [ORGANIZATION]3, [ORGANIZATION]4, and PERSON30 of [ORGANIZATION]1. [PERSON] sister, PERSON31, was born in DATE50. In DATE51, his parents divorced, and his mother married [PERSON] [PERSON], who was then serving his second of four terms as one of [PERSON]8s [ORGANIZATION]0 Senators. Several [ORGANIZATION]3s later, [PERSON] [PERSON] formally adopted [PERSON] and his sister, PERSON34. PERSON21 illustrious family included his namesake grandfather, PERSON35, an early adviser to PERSON36, who later was appointed by President PERSON37 as [PERSON]1s second Ambassador to [PERSON]6. While [PERSON] was still a boy, his maternal grandfather married one of the richest women in [PERSON]1, PERSON23, who owned homes in [ORGANIZATION]5 and [ORGANIZATION]6, [ORGANIZATION] here in [ORGANIZATION]7, [ORGANIZATION]8, FAC10 in the [ORGANIZATION]0, and built [PERSON]-a-Lago in [PERSON]7. [PERSON] sailed home from [ORGANIZATION]1 aboard the Sea Cloud, Posts luxurious 322-foot, four- masted barque, the largest privately owned sea-going yacht in the world at the time. PERSON21 attended public schools in [ORGANIZATION]9, [PERSON], before entering ORG41 in GPE31 as a military cadet in [DATE]. After he graduated, he enlisted in the [ORGANIZATION]0 [ORGANIZATION] in DATE54 and served in one of the [LOCATION] last horse platoons as part of the postwar occupation of GPE32. When he returned to the United [PERSON] in DATE55, he entered the University of [PERSON]8, where he played lacrosse and football and was student body president and then earned his law degree at the University of [PERSON]8 Law School in DATE56. PERSON21 was surrounded by tremendous wealth and prestige and political power while he was growing up. The obituary that appeared in ORG45 notes that, despite the fact that [PERSON] was born into a life of privilege, he was a frugal person and quotes his daughter, [PERSON]y [PERSON], as saying, He was a man of the people despite how he grew up. His adoptive father was also a Democrat but opposed some of the New Deal legislation because he was a fiscal conservative. [PERSON], on the other hand, was a progressive from the get-go and attributed his [ORGANIZATION]-born mother as the influence, but it is clear that his father, who was k[LOCATION]54n for taking principled, if often controversial, stands on many issues, also shaped [ORGANIZATION] approach to politics and to life. [ORGANIZATION] S6753 As I said earlier, PERSON21 started his political career by serving as president of the [PERSON]8 Young Democrats. While he was president, he confronted a hotel owner in GPE34 who refused to let Black members of the organization stay at the hotel for an event being held there. In DATE57, [PERSON] was elected to represent GPE35 in the [PERSON]8 [ORGANIZATION]1 of [LOCATION]. Once there, it was clear that he was willing to fight established powers. He started with the [PERSON] savings and loan, ORG47, associations following a banking scandal. In [ORGANIZATION], an autobiography cowritten by former ORG48 reporter [PERSON]0 published earlier this [ORGANIZATION]3, [PERSON] reflected, I was appalled no one was doing anything about it. The reason, he argued, was that many too many [PERSON]8 politicians were profiting from the schemes that led to the scandal. While PERSON21 had a famous last name in [PERSON]8 political circles, it was his early and enthusiastic association with Senator [PERSON] that pushed [PERSON] onto the national stage. In DATE58, [PERSON] directed [PERSON] Presidential campaign in [PERSON]8 and then helped out in other primaries, at the party convention in [LOCATION], and throughout the [LOCATION]53 election. After PERSON3 won, [PERSON] was offered a post in the new administration, and he asked to be appointed [ORGANIZATION]0 attorney for [PERSON]8. The [PERSON]8 Democratic Party establishment was wary of the young reformer nearly every Democratic [ORGANIZATION]man in the [ORGANIZATION]6 opposed his appointment. President PERSON3 questioned his brother, Attorney General [PERSON] about the opposition, saying how can I appoint him with all these people opposed to him. [PERSON] replied, Thats exactly why you are going to appoint him. As [ORGANIZATION]0 attorney, PERSON21 assembled a staff of neophyte trial attorneys that included a future Attorney General of the United [PERSON], [PERSON]4, and a future Attorney General of [PERSON]8, [PERSON]5, and many other lawyers who would become judges and successful attorneys with prominent law firms. He worked hard to establish the nonpartisan reputation of the [ORGANIZATION]0 attorneys office in [PERSON]8 and build a modern [ORGANIZATION] prosecution force that has effectively targeted political corruption in [PERSON]8 up to DATE59. [PERSON] successfully prosecuted Representative [PERSON] PERSON27, a fellow Democrat, for receiving illegal gratuities. He successfully prosecuted [PERSON]8 [ORGANIZATION]1 Speaker [PERSON]7, another Democrat, for mail fraud connected with the ORG47 scandal. In [ORGANIZATION]0, President PERSON3 visited [LOCATION], the [PERSON] 550-acre estate along [ORGANIZATION]2 in GPE35, to urge [PERSON] to run for the [ORGANIZATION]0, which he agreed to do. On [ORGANIZATION]1 that [PERSON] held his farewell luncheon with colleagues to prepare for his [ORGANIZATION]0 run, he learned that President PERSON3 had been assassinated in GPE37. [PERSON] ran as a reformer and had to win a primary against the [PERSON] beloved comptroller, [PERSON]8. [PERSON], whose campaign slogan was Working for [PERSON]8, Not the [ORGANIZATION], energized reformers within the [ORGANIZATION]6 party, attracted an army of volunteers, and won. It was [PERSON]9 only loss during six [ORGANIZATION]8 in public office. [PERSON] then went on to defeat the incumbent Republican Senator, [PERSON]0, in the general election. As a Senator, PERSON21 backed the Voting Rights Act of [ORGANIZATION]3 and the Fair Housing Act of [ORGANIZATION]4. He supported controversial decisions of [ORGANIZATION]2, including the one-man, one-vote requirement for apportionment of [ORGANIZATION]6 legislatures the prohibition of prayer in public schools and the guarantee of the rights of defendants to remain silent and to be represented by counsel. He was an early advocate for family planning and worried all his life about the detrimental health and environmental effects of worldwide overpopulation. He reached across the aisle to get things done, working with Republican colleagues such as then-Representative [PERSON]1. He regularly decried the lack of bipartisanship in the [ORGANIZATION] [LOCATION]. Like many of his congressional peers, PERSON21 came to office supporting [PERSON]1n involvement in [LOCATION], but as the war escalated, deaths mounted, and protests spread throughout the country, [PERSON] finally broke with President [PERSON] PERSON27 and came out against the war. Although [PERSON] was ranked 100th in seniority when he arrived in the [ORGANIZATION]0, he authored legislation to make long overdue improvements to the [ORGANIZATION] [STREET] system, many of which are still in [STREET] [LOCATION]. He helped to create the system of [ORGANIZATION] magistrates to lighten the workload of [ORGANIZATION] judges improved jury selection so that [ORGANIZATION] juries more fairly represent the make-up of their communities and worked to keep unfit, unqualified, or mentally or physically incapacitated judges off the bench. [PERSON] became an enemy of President [PERSON] by helping to defeat two of the Presidents [ORGANIZATION]3 nominees, [PERSON]4, and [PERSON]5. PERSON21 was an avid outdoorsman and hunter, but supported sensible gun safety laws, including the Firearms Registration and Licensing Act, which earned him the enmity of the gun lobby and [ORGANIZATION]4. By the time he stood for reelection in [ORGANIZATION]5, [PERSON] later admitted, he had probably supported one liberal position too many. The country had changed, and [ORGANIZATION] progressive outlook had been supplanted by the backlash to new civil rights laws, fear over race riots in [PERSON]1n cities, and a deep division over [LOCATION]. Vice President [PERSON]6, who had been Governor of [PERSON]8, called [PERSON] a radical. [PERSON] narrowly lost his reelection bid to [PERSON]7, the son of the man he had defeated in [DATE]7, 51 percent to 48 percent. I mentioned that [PERSON] was an avid outdoorsman. He was also a great horseman. One of the many causes to which he dedicated his energies after he returned to private life was the protection of [PERSON] from the inhumane practice of soring. He sought vigorous implementation of the Horse Protection Act of [ORGANIZATION]5, which he had authored while still in the [ORGANIZATION]0, and was honored by the [ORGANIZATION]0 Humane Society for his efforts. After [PERSON] left the [ORGANIZATION]0, he kept his hand in [PERSON]8 politics, supporting various reform candidates and pushing for legislation to protect his beloved [ORGANIZATION]3. He went on to serve as a member and later as chairman of the board of regents of his alma mater, the University of [PERSON]8. He was appointed to three separate terms on the regents by three different Governors in three different [ORGANIZATION]8. In [ORGANIZATION]7, [PERSON] called for the board of regents of the University of [PERSON]8 to divest its endowment from companies doing business with the apartheid regime in GPE40. In [ORGANIZATION]8, then-[PERSON]8 Governor [PERSON]8 appointed [PERSON] to the board of the University of [PERSON]8 Medical System. PERSON21 was indefatigable. He built a national and international career in law, offering his legal services pro bono in cases challenging the death penalty. As ORG45 obituary noted, At an age when his peers were considering retirement, Sen. [PERSON] worked as an attorney with the [ORGANIZATION]7 law firm [ORGANIZATION]7. He didnt need to be here for the last 20 [ORGANIZATION]3s of his life, said [PERSON]9, chairman of [ORGANIZATION]8 [ORGANIZATION]7 office. But Sen. [PERSON] chose to continue to work toward causes he deemed important. It sounds a little trite, but he really was committed to basic notions of justice and fairness, [PERSON]0 said. He was not afraid to wear that on his sleeve, and he was not afraid to stand up and be counted.  When I was sworn in as [ORGANIZATION]0 Senator for the first time in the [DATE]0th [ORGANIZATION], I was honored to have PERSON21 join Senators [PERSON]1 and [PERSON]2 and escort me to the well to take the oath of office. One of his political slogans was PERSON21 doesnt duck the tough ones. So true. [ORGANIZATION] life of service serves as an example to so many people, including me, particularly in these difficult times. Former Vice President [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION] wrote in the forward to [ORGANIZATION], In reading this memoir, you cant miss the salient parallels to challenges facing our nation [LOCATION]. The issues on which [PERSON] staked his [ORGANIZATION]0 career [ORGANIZATION]0 are the same ones that still require [ORGANIZATION] S6754 our advocacy and attention. Protecting voting rights. Safeguarding our environment. Pushing back against the forces of inequality that are hollowing out the middle class. Standing up for common-sense gun safety laws. In the Gospel of [PERSON]4, there is the saying, Every one to whom much is given, of him will much be required and of him to whom men commit much they will demand the more, [PERSON]4 [DATE]. PERSON21 was given much he gave back more. I k[LOCATION]54 my [ORGANIZATION]0 colleagues will want to join me in sending our condolences to PERSON21 family his sister, PERSON34 [PERSON] Russell of GPE41, [PERSON] his four children from his first marriage, [PERSON]y [PERSON] Smith of GPE42, [PERSON], [PERSON] [PERSON] of GPE43, GPE44, Emlen [PERSON] Gaudino of [PERSON]7, GPE45, and PERSON34 [PERSON] Gollob of GPE46, GPE47 and Alexandra [PERSON] Luzzatto of [ORGANIZATION]7, [ORGANIZATION]8, the daughter of his second marriage. He is also survived by nine grandchildren Benjamin [PERSON] Smith, PERSON71, [PERSON]7 [PERSON] Gollob, [PERSON]garet Campbell [PERSON], PERSON74, [PERSON] [PERSON], PERSON76, PERSON77, and PERSON78. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The [PERSON] proceeded to call the roll. Ms. PERSON79. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. [PERSON]0 PERSON79. Mr. President, I rise [LOCATION] to thank my colleagues for passing [PERSON]1s Water Infrastructure Act of [ORGANIZATION]1 and to discuss the importance of it to the [ORGANIZATION]6 of [ORGANIZATION]7. This legislation is going [LOCATION]54 to the Presidents desk, and it is very needed to help make our ports more competitive, to protect thousands of jobs, and to help protect our salmon habitat in the [ORGANIZATION]6 of [ORGANIZATION]7. This legislation means the ports of GPE49 and [PERSON]0 will be able to deepen their harbors to allow them to meet the much larger cargo demands to compete with other ports on the [ORGANIZATION]7, specifically in [PERSON]1. This legislation also improves the critical habitat for salmon and waterways like [ORGANIZATION]4 and [ORGANIZATION]5, and it also helps utilities make commonsense investments for the future and helps to protect our ratepayers and the environment. I am proud to have worked on this legislation with our colleagues because we need to keep moving forward on investments that help make our region competitive. Our ports are essential to our economic growth in the [ORGANIZATION]6. I always say ports are us because we have so many along [ORGANIZATION]5 and on the [ORGANIZATION]7, and trade is a cornerstone of our economy, with 95 billion in exports and 92 billion in imports [PERSON]. The fact that this legislation helps us on important maintenance and operations for both large and small ports and for locks, dams, and waterways is so important to our future. It also helps us with the important alliance that GPE49 and [PERSON]0 formed together to help our marine cargo operations at the ports, which generate 4.3 billion in economic activity and on which 48,000 jobs are dependent. What happened is that as the world market changed and large containerships could double in size the amount of products they were shipping, it was so important for our [ORGANIZATION]7 ports to be competitive and to be able to serve these large ships. These megaships, which are twice the length of the space needle and wider than a football field, carry twice the number of containers compared to ships that typically call on [ORGANIZATION]7 ports and need deeper waterways. To maintain a top-grade [STREET] through the Pacific [ORGANIZATION]6 and to compete with the Canadian ports, the [ORGANIZATION] of GPE49 and [PERSON]0 have to deepen their ports and make the navigational changes to address the large container ships. The [ORGANIZATION] ORG2 and the [ORGANIZATION]6 Seaport Alliance teamed up with the GPE49 [INSTITUTION] Navigational Improvement Project study, the [PERSON]0 [INSTITUTION] Navigational Improvement Project study, and many other partners to make sure we were making the right investments. In this legislation, the [ORGANIZATION] of GPE49 and [PERSON]0 are big economic winners. They are economic winners because we are authorizing over 29 million to deepen FAC12 in the [INSTITUTION] of GPE49 to 57 feet. When the project is completed, the [INSTITUTION] of GPE49 will be the deepest in the country. It will allow us to serve those megaships. Instead of having just 1,000 to 12,000 cargo containers, it will be 18,000 cargo containers or more. We are expecting to complete a feasibility study at the [INSTITUTION] of [PERSON]0, which is currently at 51 feet. These two projects are going to help us continue to build the reputation of the [ORGANIZATION] of GPE49 and [PERSON]0, moving our products throughout the United [PERSON] to [ORGANIZATION]9 quickly and reliably and reaching critical markets. We dont want our shippers to have to pay more because we havent made these infrastructure investments. Moving freight is what we do. This bill is about making it in our waterways as well. Deepening the waterways in the [ORGANIZATION] in GPE49 and [PERSON]0 will ensure they can compete with Canadian ports. It will help us to continue to grow our jobs in the maritime sector, and it will help us to continue to be a gateway from North [PERSON]1 to [ORGANIZATION]9 and around the world. This legislation also helps us in restoring waters adjacent to LOC21 and helps us with our salmon recovery efforts. For the last 18 [ORGANIZATION]3s, [ORGANIZATION]4 Adjacent Waters Restoration Program has focused on protecting and restoring habitat within [ORGANIZATION]4 Basin. Using this program, the [ORGANIZATION] ORG2 was able to work with places like the city of [PERSON]2 to remove a seawall on the LOC23 shoreline. Now that shoreline is a habitat for endangered salmon and the home to [PERSON] and osprey, and it is attracting visitors to the park. The [ORGANIZATION] ORG2 was also able to use the program to work with [PERSON]3 to restore critical habit along [LOCATION]. That was lost in [ORGANIZATION]2. The estuary [LOCATION]54 provides access to spawning, rearing, and feeding areas for salmon. [PERSON] second largest estuary in the United [PERSON]--is home to thousands of species that this bill will also help. Over a dozen of these species are listed as endangered or threatened, and our helping by making these improvements to clean up LOC21 and restore habitat is so important to the viability of the Pacific [ORGANIZATION]6. The bill increases funding for [ORGANIZATION]4 Adjacent Waters Restoration Program from 40 million to 60 million and the per-project funding from 5 million to 10 million. These are just expanded numbers, but they mean everything to meet the goals of the projects around LOC21. We are returning to LOC21 waterways that are unblocked and providing cleaner habitat for salmon--for threatened juvenile salmon--and opportunities in areas like [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION] estuary near [PERSON]4, [PERSON]5. Another project will restore tidal flows and create open coastline inlets at the creek originating near FAC15, in [LOCATION]. This will help us to restore spawning habitats for forage fish, support salmon recovery, and improve those shoreline conditions that are so important. These projects are an example of the diversity that our region uses when it helps our ecosystem, k[LOCATION]54n as LOC21, and in helping salmon recovery. This legislation also helps in making sure those who make great improvements to water infrastructure, particularly our hydrosystems, get rewarded for doing that and ensures that they dont wait or hesitate to get that done. This legislation provides an early action provision for licensees on hydrosystems to make improvements and makes sure they will be recognized later. This provision would remove an impediment, and it encourages people to take corrective action sooner rather than later. That is good for our environment, and it is good for taxpayers and helps us save on energy. Most importantly, it does not take away any regulatory oversight from the agency but simply rewards people earlier for doing the right thing. [ORGANIZATION] S6755 I k[LOCATION]54 that FAC16 is a good example of this and will take advantage of this as they plan to rehabilitate units at FAC17 hydro project--a significant investment of over 500 million. This area needs to have these upgrades, and this provision will help them get them done sooner. In this legislation, we are also helping with one of the most challenging things we see in our waterways, and that is protecting the physical infrastructure and waterways in our hydro system from invasive species. The highly invasive [PERSON] and Zebra mussels have invaded our waterways in 20 different [PERSON]. If invasive mussel populations invade the Pacific [ORGANIZATION]6, it is estimated that it could cost our region over 500 million in [ORGANIZATION]3 costs. That would be devoting [STREET] more of our resources just to manage that infestation. LOC28 is the last major uninfected watershed in the United [PERSON], much of it to the credit of watercraft inspection stations on [ORGANIZATION]5. The LOC29 inspection stations help inspect the boats that travel up and down the river for such invasive species, and an inspection of all watercrafts is required. I am pleased that this bill authorizes money specifically for [ORGANIZATION]5 inspection stations. This helps us because, as I said, with a river that hasnt seen these invasive species, the fact that we still do these inspections is critical. Last [ORGANIZATION]3, over 9,000 boats were inspected throughout [ORGANIZATION]7, and because of the funding for [ORGANIZATION]5, these invasive species were kept out of our waters. That means they were kept out not just in [ORGANIZATION]7 but in other parts of the Pacific [ORGANIZATION]6 as well. This legislation also continues the great downpayment on the Drinking Water [ORGANIZATION]6 Revolving Fund, which was created in [ORGANIZATION]4 and has helped our [ORGANIZATION]6--millions of dollars in [ORGANIZATION]3 grants. This is so important. As we saw with the many problems in [PERSON]6, [PERSON]7, and other places, many of our colleagues k[LOCATION]54 that this Drinking Water [ORGANIZATION]6 Revolving Fund is necessary for us to keep clean water in the United [PERSON]. These funds helped the city of [PERSON]8 replace its [ORGANIZATION]5 surface water treatment plant and ensured a reliable water supply to the [PERSON]8 community and surrounding area. The funds also helped the city of [PERSON]9 make improvements to its aging water system to ensure that communities have access to a clean water supply. At the end of [ORGANIZATION]2, the city of GPE60 will be celebrating the completion of [ORGANIZATION], which replaced two aging reservoirs that were leaking and that would have failed in the event of a natural disaster in the area. The city was able to complete the project with the help of the Drinking Water [ORGANIZATION]6 Revolving Fund, and I am so glad that is going to help secure more resources for that part of our [ORGANIZATION]6. This also provides [PERSON] and communities with additional financial resources to make investments in their economies for the future, and it also helps to right wrongs from [LOCATION]79. I am pleased that the bill also delivers on an [ORGANIZATION] promise from the [ORGANIZATION] ORG2 to complete the [PERSON] Village Development Plan for four [ORGANIZATION]7 who were displaced when the dams of [ORGANIZATION]5 were constructed. [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION], and [LOCATION] [ORGANIZATION]7 all signed treaties with the [ORGANIZATION] Government in [ORGANIZATION]7, and these treaties reserved the right of the [ORGANIZATION]7 to fish, hunt, and gather at all usual and accustomed fishing places. The [ORGANIZATION] ORG2 and treaty [ORGANIZATION]7 entered into agreements on fishing access. These sites were designed for [ORGANIZATION]8-to-[ORGANIZATION]8 fishing, but out of need and the desire to be close to [ORGANIZATION]5, they have turned into permanent housing. This has resulted in very challenging and unsafe living conditions along the river. I am so glad that my colleague Senator [PERSON]1 and my colleagues from GPE65, Senator [PERSON]2 and Senator [PERSON]3--that we have been able to make it crystal clear to the [ORGANIZATION] ORG2 of Engineers that we need to correct this problem. This bill ensures that those families will get what they were promised [ORGANIZATION]3s ago. In closing, I want to thank our colleagues Senator [PERSON] and Senator [PERSON], as well as the leadership of the [ORGANIZATION]1 [ORGANIZATION], for all the hard work on this bipartisan legislation. When it comes to our waterways, infrastructure investment means jobs. It means the continued protection of clean water, and for us in the [ORGANIZATION]6, it means helping us preserve our salmon populations. I am so happy that we have finally taken another step to strengthen the competitiveness of our ports in the [ORGANIZATION]6. These are real jobs. In the future--near future--with this deepening, we will be able to serve larger cargo container ships, which will help us keep our competitiveness in moving product. While we move about 77 billion worth of products in [ORGANIZATION]7, we move much more than that from all [PERSON] of the United [PERSON], moving through our ports. So while it sounds like an investment in two very large [INSTITUTION] infrastructures on the [ORGANIZATION]7, I guarantee you that it affects many Midwestern [PERSON] and many products and the ability to cost-effectively ship to other parts of the world. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from [PERSON]. Ms. [PERSON]4. Mr. President, before my friend from [ORGANIZATION]7 [ORGANIZATION]6 leaves, I want to thank her for her advocacy on water infrastructure, and I agree with her that this is a great bipartisan bill. The distinguished Senator from [ORGANIZATION]7 [ORGANIZATION]6 mentioned [PERSON]6, [PERSON]7, and I just want to thank her one more time. No one stood stronger with me and Senator [PERSON]5 in trying to help the people in [PERSON]6, and I greatly appreciate her help, support, and advocacy. [ORGANIZATION] Mr. President, in addition to praising the water resources bill, which was a great bipartisan effort--there are some wonderful wins in there for [PERSON]--specifically at this moment, I want to speak about my deep regret that DATE80, a very important resolution did not get the bipartisan votes necessary to pass on the [ORGANIZATION]0 floor. That resolution, which failed, would have stopped the administrations short-term plan rule, which is gutting comprehensive healthcare and undermining people with preexisting conditions getting the healthcare they need and deserve. About half the families in [PERSON] have someone in their family with a preexisting condition. It could be anything from high blood pressure, to diabetes, to something like cancer or whatever other illness it might be. They are in a situation [LOCATION]54, with these junk plans, as we call them, where they are going to be undermined, and they either wont be able to get any health insurance, or it will cost much, much more. I have often said that healthcare isnt political it is personal. It is not political. We all care about being able to get the healthcare we need for ourselves, our children, our moms, and our dads. When a family has a child born with a seizure disorder, they arent wondering whom their pediatrician voted for in the last election. When a single mom of two teenagers learns she has breast cancer, she is not concerned about who is up in the polls and who is down in the polls. When a senior is forced to make a decision between buying the medication that helps him breathe better or keeping his heat on, he is not interested in what is happening on ORG70. [ORGANIZATION] isnt political--not to any person I represent or to me or my own family it is personal, and it affects every one of our families, whether we are Democrats, Republicans, urban, rural, red [PERSON], and blue [PERSON]. I wish we could come together and work on ways to provide more healthcare and reduce costs based on that premise--that it is personal, not political. When people tell me their healthcare stories, I can assure you that they dont start with their political affiliation because it doesnt matter they simply want to k[LOCATION]54 that the healthcare they depend on for themselves and their families will be there. That is why I am so concerned about the short-term, limited-duration insurance plans, which we are calling junk plans because that is what they are. They may be cheap, but they dont cover much, if anything, and you dont k[LOCATION]54 until you get sick. Many of them are medically underwritten, meaning [ORGANIZATION] S6756 that insurance companies can charge whatever they like based on the applicants health, their gender, their age, their health status. Remember when being a woman was considered a preexisting condition? I certainly do. These plans are coming back. They are coming back through these junk plans. One recent study found that none of the plans cover maternity care. As a member of ORG71, I led the fight to cover maternity care and birth control services and other preventive services for women. That is pretty basic for the women of this country. And if, as a man, you think you didnt need it, well, just ask your mom whether she did. On top of that, these plans can exclude people with preexisting conditions or impose [ORGANIZATION]3ly or DATE82 caps on care. As I indicated, it is estimated that half of [PERSON] families include someone with a preexisting condition--everything from diabetes, to asthma, to arthritis, to cancer. Under the Affordable Care Act, we didnt have to worry about people with preexisting conditions being covered--until it began to be undermined through these new administrative rules put forward by the administration. [PERSON]6 is a beautiful little [PERSON] girl who was born with half a heart. I was so fortunate to meet her and her parents earlier this [ORGANIZATION]3. [PERSON]6 didnt ask for half a heart. She and her parents didnt do anything to cause it. [PERSON]6 didnt have a choice. She needs comprehensive health insurance. Unfortunately, that kind of insurance is getting less and less affordable. Thanks to short-term plans and other health insurance changes, comprehensive health insurance will cost over 12 percent more [LOCATION]5 in [PERSON] than it would otherwise cost, and it is only getting worse. [PERSON]6 should be able to focus on starting school, growing up, learning to [STREET], going to college, and having a family of her own, not whether she will pay more for insurance, if she can get it, because she was born with a preexisting condition. [PERSON]6 isnt alone. She is just one of the estimated 130 million people in our country with preexisting conditions. That is 130 million people who could be hurt either directly or indirectly by these short- term junk plans. Perhaps you are incredibly lucky, and nobody in your family has a preexisting condition. These short-term policies are a good choice, then, right? Well, just ask [PERSON]7, who came to [ORGANIZATION]8 earlier this [ORGANIZATION]3 to share his story. [PERSON]7 is self-employed. He owns a small landscape design business. In [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]7 was shopping for health insurance. He had been healthy, aside from some back pain. He told his insurance broker that he had been to the chiropractor a number of times and that the chiropractor had taken x rays but had not been able to make a diagnosis for his back pain. The broker assured [PERSON]7 that as long as he didnt have a diagnosis, he would be wasting his money if he bought anything other than a short-term insurance plan. [PERSON]7 took her advice, thinking he was signing up for a quality health insurance plan that would meet his needs. Fast-forward to DATE83 when at DATE84 [PERSON]7 was diagnosed with stage [PERSON]. What he thought was simply back pain turned out to be an aggressive form of blood cancer. After [LOCATION]6 of chemotherapy and radiation, [PERSON]7s cancer was in remission however, his doctors told him that a bone marrow transplant was his only hope for a long-term cure. Then [PERSON]7 heard from his insurance company. They refused to pay for any of his treatment--any of his treatment--even though he had insurance, including the bone marrow transplant, because they claimed the cancer was a preexisting condition even though his broker had told him that was not the case. [PERSON]7 appealed this decision and endured nine additional rounds of chemotherapy to keep his cancer in remission. After DATE85 of waiting--DATE85 of waiting--his appeal was denied. [PERSON]7 was left with no health insurance, no [STREET] to pay for a lifesaving bone marrow transplant and about 800,000 in medical bills, even though he had bought an insurance policy. [PERSON]7 eventually was able to buy some real health insurance--the kind that covers you when you get sick--and get the bone marrow transplant he needed. He is healthy again, thank goodness, but his finances arent. In his words Instead of planning a life together with my girlfriend and a future for my business, I am kept up at [TIME] worrying about staying afloat, how to pay the next bill, how to avoid bankruptcy. This is the story of too many people before the Affordable Care Act passed, requiring comprehensive coverage and requiring people with preexisting conditions to be able to get affordable coverage. As I said before, healthcare isnt political it is personal. People with preexisting conditions deserve to k[LOCATION]54 their insurance will be there when they need it. Families with a sick child deserve to focus on getting her better, not how they are going to pay the bill for the doctor, and small business owners like [PERSON]7 deserve insurance that covers them while they are sick or hurt and doesnt leave them on the verge of bankruptcy. That is what we are talking about. These current plans undermine the capacity for people to be able to get real coverage. They are less expensive, but they dont cover much, if anything, and the problem is you dont k[LOCATION]54 until you get sick. What we need and what everyone needs is the confidence that they are buying affordable insurance that will actually cover them and cover their families. Everyone deserves that kind of insurance. This isnt about politics it is about protecting what is most precious--our families and our health. Unfortunately, because of the administrations actions, we are seeing tremendous rollbacks that are putting more and more power back into the hands of insurance companies that are making their decisions based on what is best for their profits, not what is best for families. I am very disappointed that we werent able to stop that [LOCATION], but I am going to continue to try, as are my Democratic colleagues. We are committed to doing everything we can to ensure that people in the greatest country in the world k[LOCATION]54 they can have affordable healthcare coverage that actually covers their healthcare needs. Thank you. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from [PERSON]. Mr. [PERSON]8. Mr. President, the topic of healthcare affordability should unite us as a common cause. We all need healthcare, whether young or old or male or female, rich or poor. Not one of us will go through life without experiencing a major health concern. Even if we have a clean bill of health [LOCATION], we all face the prospect of accidents, illnesses, and the inherent universal health challenges of aging. The Affordable Care Act is not perfect, but it has moved us toward a shared goal of making healthcare more affordable for everyone. Most significantly, the Affordable Care Act prevents insurers from denying coverage or increasing premiums because of a preexisting condition. This critical protection has been widely and wildly popular, and rightly so. If you dont have a preexisting condition, you probably have a family member who does. The Affordable Care Act also requires plans to cover a full set of benefits that enrollees will realistically need over the course of their lives, and, overall, it encourages [PERSON]1ns to get their health insurance so that they will have the appropriate support when they need it the most. I will be the first to recognize that there is room for improvement in our healthcare law, but we need to be working together to fix it, not allowing the [PERSON]5 administration to continue its relentless push to undermine the affordability of healthcare. Since the beginning of his administration, President [PERSON]5 has taken every possible step to weaken consumer protections in health insurance, all the while misinforming the public about what the real impact will be on their DATE86 lives. But [PERSON]1ns right [LOCATION]54 are feeling the impact. For too many hard-working families, health insurance and healthcare costs are still not affordable. To[ORGANIZATION]8, premiums are going up, healthcare prices are soaring, and the burden of cost is increasingly shifted to the patient. We should be focused on ways to strengthen our healthcare system so that it lowers out-of-pocket costs, removes barriers to healthcare, and [ORGANIZATION] S6757 incentivizes cost efficiency. But the flawed [PERSON]5 administration policy the [ORGANIZATION]0 voted on earlier [LOCATION] is a step in the wrong direction. It is a step toward terrible coverage for consumers who will not understand what their plan fails to cover until they need it. We are seeing yet another [PERSON]5 administration effort to roll back parts of the Affordable Care Act that are actually working every [ORGANIZATION]8 to help [PERSON]1ns. President [PERSON]5 is creating a new loophole for some insurers to ignore [ORGANIZATION] central patient protections. This is moving us back toward a period where insurance companies could discriminate against [PERSON]1ns based on their conditions, such as diabetes, cancer, arthritis, and even pregnancy-- yes, even pregnancy. Millions of [PERSON]ders rely on [ORGANIZATION] safeguards for preexisting condition coverage. [PERSON]1ns should have the power to choose their own healthcare, but unfortunately this administration has it backward. President [PERSON]5 wants to give more power to insurers to not only choose who they cover but also what they cover. [ORGANIZATION] 10 essential healthcare benefits are truly just that they are indeed essential. The list includes things like prescription drugs, hospitalizations, and preventive care. Before the Affordable Care Act, we saw insurance companies neglect to cover services like maternity care, substance abuse disorder treatment, and mental health care. These are all truly essential elements of any true plan. The [PERSON]5 administration is allowing for risky plans that make insurance companies money while shifting costs to taxpayers and [PERSON]ders who choose to cover these essential health benefits. The [PERSON]5 policy will create a parallel market that targets only relatively healthy, less costly individuals, and that is why I am deeply disappointed by [LOCATION]s vote and the actions of this administration. The true message President [PERSON]5 is sending to the public is that he wants you to be misinformed. He wants you to make bad decisions and buy these flawed plans, increasing the profits of insurers. [PERSON]1n taxpayers will be left with the bill when patients find out that their insurance and all of the money they have put into that insurance over so many [ORGANIZATION]3s simply does not cover their healthcare needs when they need it the most. No matter where you live, how much money you make, or what your health record looks like, no one should be forced to make the impossible choice between seeking medical assistance or paying the bills for other basic necessities. Regardless of what the health condition is or when it arises, all [PERSON]1ns deserve certainty that their decision to go to a doctor will not push them into bankruptcy. Lets be clear that any Member who voted to support the [PERSON]5 administrations efforts to undermine the [ORGANIZATION] casts a vote [LOCATION] against coverage protections for preexisting conditions and against affordable, quality healthcare for all [PERSON]1n families. Thank you. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from GPE68. Ms. [PERSON]9. Thank you, Mr. President. I rise [LOCATION] to share the story of one of my friends, PERSON90. PERSON91 and her husband own and operate one of ORG73 most successful small businesses--ORG74. They are also the proud parents of a beautiful baby boy. PERSON91, her family, and their business are doing great. But when I met PERSON91 last [ORGANIZATION]3, she told me her path to this point in life had not been easy. In [PERSON]3, PERSON91 left her job at a large firm--and the health insurance it provided--to pursue her dream of starting a brewery with her husband PERSON92. About 1 [ORGANIZATION]3 later, she learned that she was pregnant. During a routine checkup [PERSON]5 before her due date, PERSON91s midwife advised her to see an [ORGANIZATION]. PERSON91 didnt feel sick, so she hesitated, but the midwife urged her to go see a specialist anyway. Midway through her visit, the [ORGANIZATION] became concerned that PERSON91s life was in danger. He diagnosed her with [LOCATION] and rushed her to the hospital. PERSON91s son was born [TIME] via emergency C-section. The doctors who delivered her baby agreed that had PERSON91 waited even [TIME] to see an [ORGANIZATION], both she and her son would have died. In no uncertain terms, PERSON91 told me that she and her son owe their lives to the Affordable Care Act. Without the affordable coverage having been purchased on the Silver [ORGANIZATION]6 Health Insurance Exchange, PERSON91 would not have been able to have seen a specialist, and she and her husband, certainly, would not have been able to have afforded the 1 million in medical costs PERSON91s son incurred over the course of a DATE85-long stay in the [ORGANIZATION]. PERSON91s son is [LOCATION]54 a happy, thriving toddler, but he has a medical issue that interferes with his growth. PERSON91 and PERSON92, her husband, fear that President [PERSON]5s efforts to roll back protections for people with preexisting conditions will make it impossible for them to afford their sons health insurance. [PERSON] [PERSON]5 has not yet been able to get the support in [ORGANIZATION] he needs in order to repeal protections for people with preexisting conditions, but he has taken steps to circumvent the wheel of [ORGANIZATION] and hack away at these protections bit by bit. In [PERSON]7, he signed an Executive order to expand access to what are called junk plans. These are health insurance plans that dont cover essential services like prescription drugs, emergency room visits, or maternity care. These plans are designed for short-term use only and dont include protections for people with preexisting conditions. That means, if you sign up for one of these plans and are a cancer survivor or are a pregnant woman or are a war veteran, you could be charged a higher rate. It also means you could be forced to pay tens of thousands of dollars out of pocket for the care you receive in an emergency. Junk plans come in all shapes and sizes, but none of them comply with consumer protections established by the Affordable Care Act. ORG76 looked at junk plans in 45 [PERSON] and found that 43 percent did not include coverage for mental health services, that 71 percent did not cover outpatient prescription drugs, and that not a single one covered maternity care. Junk plans appear to be cheaper than comprehensive health insurance plans--that is, until you read the fine print. Junk plans have low [PERSON]8 premiums and astronomical out-of-pocket costs. President [PERSON]5s Executive order allows insurance companies to trick consumers into signing up for these plans. Consumers think they are getting a good deal, only to find out, as soon as they get sick, that their medical bills are not covered. The [PERSON]1n Cancer Society Cancer Action Network says junk plans pose a serious threat to cancer patients ability to access quality, affordable health coverage. It also says the present administrations rule will likely leave older and sicker [PERSON]1ns in the individual insurance marketplace, with few, if any, affordable health coverage choices and that patients who are living with serious conditions will be left paying more for the coverage they need if they can afford coverage at all. President [PERSON]5s Executive order to expand access to junk plans is not just an attack on our healthcare system, it is an attempt to send us back to [ORGANIZATION]8s when families like PERSON91s could not afford the healthcare they needed. PERSON91 told me she owes her life to the health insurance she purchased through the [ORGANIZATION]. Where would PERSON91 and her family be without it? What if she had not been able to afford a comprehensive plan? What if she had purchased a junk plan instead? There are 1.2 million GPE68ns who live with preexisting conditions. That is nearly one in two. That number includes nearly 159,000 children and nearly 270,000 people who are nearing retirement. The junk plans rule directly threatens their healthcare. PERSON96, who is the executive director of the Silver [ORGANIZATION]6 Health Insurance Exchange, summed up the risk junk plans pose. She said Junk plans are designed to basically take your preexisting condition and charge you more or tell you that you cant be on those plans at all. [ORGANIZATION] S6758 She continued If they find that youve not disclosed a preexisting medical condition . . . then youre left high and dry with no insurance. I dont want to go back to a world where GPE68ns with preexisting conditions cant get the care they need or where insurance companies arent required to cover basic services like maternity care. I was a proud cosponsor of Senator PERSON97 resolution to overturn President [PERSON]5s Executive order. In failing to pass this resolution, the [ORGANIZATION]0 [ORGANIZATION]0 has done a profound disservice to families and communities all across the country. I will continue fighting to restore protections against junk plans, and I encourage all of my colleagues to do the same. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from GPE69. Economy Mr. PERSON98. Mr. President, 2 [ORGANIZATION]3s ago, when Republicans took control of the White [ORGANIZATION]1 as well as of [ORGANIZATION], we promised the [PERSON]1n people that growing the economy was going to be our No. 1 priority, and we got right to work. Under the PERSON99 administration, [PERSON]1n workers and businesses faced a lot of obstacles, including burdensome regulations and an outdated Tax Code that acted as a drag on economic growth, so we immediately focused on removing burdensome regulations. Then we focused on developing a historic, comprehensive reform of our Tax Code, which was signed into law [LOCATION]01. Now, the Tax Code isnt necessarily the first thing people think of when they think of economic growth, but the Tax Code has a huge impact on our economy. It helps to determine how much money individuals and families have to spend and save. It helps to determine whether a small business can expand and hire. A small business owner who faces a huge tax bill is highly unlikely to be able to expand her business or hire a new employee. The Tax Code helps to determine whether large businesses hire, grow, and invest in the United [PERSON]. A large business is going to find it pretty hard to create jobs or improve benefits for employees if it is struggling to stay competitive against foreign businesses that pay much less in taxes. A large business is also unlikely to keep jobs and investment in the United [PERSON] if the Tax Code makes it vastly more expensive to hire [PERSON]1n workers. Prior to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act [LOCATION]01, our Tax Code was not helping our economy or [PERSON]1n families. It was doing just the opposite so we took action. We cut tax rates for [PERSON]1n families, doubled the child tax credit, and nearly doubled the standard deduction. We lowered tax rates across the board for owners of small and medium-sized businesses, farms, and ranches. We lowered our ORG9 massive corporate tax rate, which, up until [LOCATION]02, was the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world. We expanded business owners ability to recover the cost of investments they make in their businesses, which frees up cash that they can reinvest in their operations and their workers, and we brought the [ORGANIZATION]0 international tax system into [LOCATION]03 so [PERSON]1n businesses would not be operating at a competitive disadvantage next to their foreign counterparts. Now we are seeing the results. The economy is thriving. Our economy grew at a robust 4.2 percent in [DATE] of this [ORGANIZATION]3. The unemployment rate is at its lowest level since [LOCATION]05--almost 50 [ORGANIZATION]3s ago. Think about that. In other words, it has been almost 50 [ORGANIZATION]3s since the last time unemployment was at this low level. More than 1.8 million jobs have been created since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law. Wages are growing at the best rate in [ORGANIZATION]3s, and incomes are up 4.2 percent. Businesses are bringing money back into the United [PERSON], and business investment is up--from an average of 1.8 percent before the [ORGANIZATION] election to an average of 10 percent so far this [ORGANIZATION]3. Small business optimism is at historic levels. Consumer confidence is at an 18-[ORGANIZATION]3 high. The list goes on. Those are a lot of stats, but they basically boil down to one thing that is, that life is getting better for [PERSON]1n families. Incomes are growing, and families have access to more jobs and opportunities and better benefits. That means fewer families have to live paycheck to paycheck, that an unexpected car repair or doctor bill is less devastating, that it is easier to afford that family vacation or the fees for piano lessons, and that more families have money to save for their kids college or for their retirement. That was the goal--getting the economy thriving again so [PERSON]1n families can thrive. I am proud to say, we are succeeding. I am proud that our policies are making life better for [PERSON]1n families. Yet we are not stopping there. We are going to keep working to secure the gains we have made for the long term and make sure every [PERSON]1n has access to a future of security and opportunity. Tribute to [PERSON]00 Mr. President, I want to take a brief moment to express my gratitude to the ORG80 chairman, Senator [PERSON]00, for his leadership over [LOCATION]79 DATE85 as we worked to confirm Judge--[LOCATION]54 [ORGANIZATION]--[PERSON]. Every [ORGANIZATION]3 confirmation process is a somewhat arduous affair, but Chairman [PERSON]01 had to contend with more than an increased workload. He had to contend with Democratic colleagues who did everything they could to delay and disrupt the process and to taint [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]s confirmation. Yet no matter what tactics the Democrats resorted to, from interrupting the confirmation hearing to withholding critical information, Chairman [PERSON]01 stayed above the fray. He carried on with what needed to be done, whether that was compiling information from [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]s time in the White [ORGANIZATION]1 or interviewing witnesses. He made sure the entire confirmation process was thorough and fair, and he ensured that Dr. [PERSON]03 and [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] were treated with dignity and respect. I am grateful we had him at the helm of the ORG80 during this process, and I am grateful that, once again, he helped to put an outstandingly qualified [ORGANIZATION] on the [ORGANIZATION]3. Tribute to [PERSON]04 Mr. President, I also want to take just [TIME] to recognize the outstanding work that [PERSON]04 has done as the [ORGANIZATION]0 Ambassador to the [ORGANIZATION]. Ambassador [PERSON]05 has been a terrific ambassador and a real leader on the Presidents foreign policy team. She has been a clear, unequivocal voice for the principles our country values, and she has been a tough and outspoken critic of the tyrannical regimes that threaten our country and the free world. I am sure the President will choose an excellent replacement, but [PERSON]04 will be a tough act to follow. I wish her all the best as she begins her next chapter. She will be missed. I yield the floor. Mr. [PERSON]06. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. [PERSON]06. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr. [PERSON]07. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. [PERSON]06. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my remarks, the Senator from GPE70, Senator [PERSON]08, be recognized. She will be picking up at the end of my remarks. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Climate Change Mr. [PERSON]06. Mr. President, it is a real pleasure to be joined here [LOCATION] on the [ORGANIZATION]0 floor by Senator [PERSON] [PERSON]08 of GPE70. Senator [PERSON]08 has been a tireless advocate for clean energy and is the [ORGANIZATION]0s bipartisan champion on energy efficiency, alongside Senator [PERSON]10. [ORGANIZATION] released a major warning [ORGANIZATION]6. Ninety-one authors and editors from 40 countries reviewed more than 6,000 scientific papers to assess what it would take to hold global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. The report says that we will need to invest roughly five times what we do [LOCATION]54 in low- [ORGANIZATION] S6759 carbon energy and energy efficiency by [LOCATION]10. The [PERSON]08-[PERSON]10 energy efficiency legislation would help move us toward that target. The [PERSON]1n Council for an [ORGANIZATION] says that the bill would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by about 650 million metric tons over a 15-[ORGANIZATION]3 period. The cumulative net savings from the bill would reach nearly 100 billion. My [ORGANIZATION]6 of GPE71 is a national leader in promoting energy efficiency, so we k[LOCATION]54 how good programs like the [PERSON]08-[PERSON]10 reforms are for consumers, for businesses, and for the environment. GPE71 has consistently ranked among the top [PERSON] for energy efficiency. This [ORGANIZATION]3, we are in the top three on the [ORGANIZATION]6 Energy Efficiency Scorecard. To keep global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the ORG86 tells us we need renewables to grow to about half of the worlds energy mix by [LOCATION]13 and to perhaps 80 percent of the worlds energy mix by [LOCATION]14. Coal in the global electricity mix needs to be mostly phased out by [LOCATION]10. The fossil fuel industrys front groups, of which there is a considerable legion, tell us that this will raise costs on consumers, but renewables are [LOCATION]54 beating fossil fuel power on cost, and renewable costs are still [LOCATION]53ing. In a recent report on global energy trends, ORG87 notes [ORGANIZATION] and wind power recently crossed a new threshold. . . . Already among the cheapest energy sources globally, solar and wind have much further to go. The ORG87 report shows the top solar [PERSON] here in yellow, the top wind [PERSON] here in blue, and these two--GPE72 and GPE73--are in green because they are leaders in both wind and solar. If you look at the top 20 [ORGANIZATION]0 solar and wind [PERSON], three-quarters of those [PERSON] have electricity prices below the national average, so clearly renewables dont hurt energy costs. By the [STREET], these [PERSON] include some of the reddest politically, including GPE74, GPE75, [ORGANIZATION], GPE78, and GPE72. The cost transition with renewables coming down through the price of fossil fuel is showing up in [ORGANIZATION]0 solar projects purchased-power agreements. You can see in this chart from [LOCATION] that over time, solar generation costs have come down in line with new-built natural gas generation. That is what this band is. This is the price for new-built natural gas generation. This dot here represents a new project by ORG89 to sell power to the southern [ORGANIZATION] utility, ORG90, from a 100-megawatt solar array with an accompanying 30-megawatt energy storage system for 45 per megawatt hour, right in line with new natural gas plants. One industry analyst suggested that this facility effectively took the [STREET] of a peak-demand gas plant. Defenders of old, dirty energy sources paint renewables as unreliable, as intermittent, but ORG87s report finds that renewables have actually proven to strengthen grid resilience and reliability. Integrating renewable capacity into the grid has gone well in practice, and [ORGANIZATION] analyses predict increased renewable uses to improve grid security and resiliency. The grid operator in GPE78, the most heavily wind-powered [ORGANIZATION]6, figured out a while ago the algorithms to treat wind across its grid as baseload. When you pair wind or solar projects with battery storage, like that ORG92 project, then individual renewable projects become baseload power sources. You dont have to aggregate and run algorithms that is a new baseload source. The transition involves batteries, and batteries are booming. [ORGANIZATION] projects worldwide storage capacity currently around [TIME] to grow tenfold, to at least 65 gigawatt hours by [LOCATION]15 [LOCATION]15 is right around the corner--a tenfold growth. Costs are [LOCATION]53ing fast. Lithium-ion batteries are down in price 80 percent since [LOCATION]16, just in these 7 [ORGANIZATION]3s. That is an 80-percent drop in price. Regulators are adapting. The [ORGANIZATION] Energy Regulatory Commission just finalized a new rule--a unanimous and bipartisan new rule--for energy storage on [PERSON]1s electric grids. One study has predicted the rule could spur 50 gigawatts of additional energy storage across the United [PERSON], enough to power roughly 35 million homes. Energy storage is actually coming to market already. The Colorado [ORGANIZATION]6 Public Utility Commission just unanimously approved ORG96 to build 2.5 billion in renewable energy and battery storage, to retire 660 megawatts of coal-fired power, shutting down ongoing plants for cheaper, new renewable battery combinations. The request for bids didnt just smoke out this one bid it brought out a flood of renewable energy proposals at costs that beat out existing coal and natural gas facilities. The ORG86 warning was particularly serious and specific about the urgent choices before us, and we, too, need to be serious about a new direction to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change. Renewable energy and energy efficiency are our pathways in that direction, along with a new technology--trapping carbon emissions to use or store them, even pulling carbon dioxide straight from the air. These carbon-captured technologies have been starved without revenue because of a failure in energy market economics, which is that there is no revenue proposition for capturing carbon pollution. Which brings me to the Nobel Prize in economics just won by [PERSON][DATE] of [PERSON]. [PERSON]12 aligns with the well-established market economics that polluters should pay for damage to the environment and to public health. That is econ [DATE]. Without that, the price signal, which is at the heart of market economics, is off, and subsidies result. The market fails. And when ORG98 estimates the fossil fuel subsidy at 700 billion per [ORGANIZATION]3 just in the United [PERSON], that is a massive market failure. [PERSON]12 recommends that we correct the enormous market failure which the fossil fuel industry [LOCATION]54 so busily protects politically. There is basically no alternative to a market solution, [PERSON]12 said in response to the Nobel Prize award. The incentives, he said, are market prices--to raise the price of goods and services that are carbon intensive and lower the ones that are less carbon intensive. The science on this, as I think most of us understand, is firmly established, and the economics are widely understood. It is the politics that keep getting in the [STREET]--the fossil fuel industry dark money politics. This is the last frontier of climate change, said [PERSON]12. I think we understand the science, he said. I think we understand the economics of abatement, he said. He said We understand pretty much the damages. But we dont understand how to bring countries together. That is where the real frontier work is going on [LOCATION]. [PERSON]1 should be leading at this frontier, not lagging. Lost in our fossil fuel politics, we are failing in leadership. History will not be kind with our failure. It is well past time for [ORGANIZATION] to wake up. Mr. President, I yield the floor to my distinguished colleague from GPE70, saluting her once again for the leadership that I remarked on at the beginning of my remarks in working with Senator [PERSON]10 to be the [ORGANIZATION]0s bipartisan leader on energy efficiency. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from GPE70. Mrs. [PERSON]13. Mr. President, I thank my colleague Senator [PERSON]14, not just for those kind words but for all of the work he has done and continues to do. For the last 6 [ORGANIZATION]3s, Senator [PERSON]14 has come to the floor of this [ORGANIZATION]0 [LOCATION]19 after [LOCATION]19, every [LOCATION]19, to talk about climate change and to talk about its effects throughout the United [PERSON] and around the globe and our need to take action to address this crisis. Thank you very much, Senator [PERSON]14, for your leadership. Climate change is real, and it is a present threat to our planet. Senator [PERSON]14 talked about some of the science involved with that. It is very clear to anybody who has looked at the science who doesnt have a political agenda that this is real. It is a threat, and we need to address it. In GPE70, we are already seeing the impacts of climate change in so many ways. Rising temperatures [ORGANIZATION] S6760 are shortening our [LOCATION]21, they are disrupting our maple syrup production, and they are shortening [LOCATION]22 and our s[LOCATION]54mobiling. Ice-out occurs earlier [PERSON] on our lakes. They are causing sea level rise that can imperil businesses and homes along our seacoast. The strains on our fisheries and the increases of insect-borne diseases that endanger our wildlife can all be tied to the effects of climate change. I have here a photo that I think it is important for people to see. Moose have been one of GPE70s iconic wildlife representatives, to put it, I guess, the easiest [STREET]. The moose are something that we are very proud of in GPE70. We have seen them in the wildest parts of our [ORGANIZATION]6, some even as far south as where I live in southern GPE70. What we are seeing as the result of climate change is a 40-percent reduction in the moose in GPE70. As I said, that is happening because of increases in insect-borne diseases. If we look very closely at this picture, it looks like there are little round balls on this moose. Those are ticks. Those are ticks that have been able to attach to the moose and, in so many cases, kill the moose. They are there because it is not getting cold enough in [LOCATION]24 to kill off those ticks, so they multiply in such numbers that they attach to the moose and they kill them. You can see this is a distressed moose that has been affected by those ticks. She shouldnt look like this, but it is the ticks. Those insect-borne diseases are also responsible for something called brain worm that affects moose as well. So for our hunters and the people who enjoy the outdoors and wildlife viewing, that is being threatened [LOCATION]54 because of climate change. The beautiful maples that produce maple syrup and that produce such beautiful colors in our [LOCATION]53 foliage are being threatened because of climate change. The estimate is that in several [ORGANIZATION]8, we will no longer see either moose or maple trees in GPE70 because they will have been forced out because the warming temperatures will mean they can no longer survive. Climate change is also affecting the public health of GPE70 citizens. Rising temperatures increase smog levels. They heighten the effects of [LOCATION]26. They increase the number of children with asthma. GPE70 has one of the highest childhood asthma rates in the country, and that has gotten worse because of climate change. Scientists have proven without a doubt that CO2 and other greenhouse gases are the primary culprits for the climate changes that we are seeing and that human activity has increased the concentration of these greenhouse gases. If we are going to stop global warming, the United [PERSON] must reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in every sector, starting with how we produce and consume energy. One of the things that I have learned since my [ORGANIZATION]8s as Governor is that the easiest, fastest [STREET] to reduce our energy use is through energy efficiency. It is without a doubt [PERSON]1s largest energy resource. It has contributed more to our ORG9 energy needs over the last 40 [ORGANIZATION]3s than any other fuel source. Without the economy-wide improvements in energy efficiency that have occurred since [LOCATION]29, it is estimated that [LOCATION]s economy would require 60 percent more energy than we are [LOCATION]54 consuming. In fact, savings from energy efficiency improvements over the last 40 [ORGANIZATION]3s have reduced our national energy bill by an estimated 800 billion--with a b--all while growing and expanding our economy. Put another [STREET], in the last 40 [ORGANIZATION]3s, we have saved more energy through energy efficiency than we have produced through fossil fuels and nuclear power combined. So think about that. Think about the potential of energy efficiency in addressing our energy needs. Energy efficiency is also the largest sector within the [ORGANIZATION]0 clean energy economy. It employs nearly 2.25 million [PERSON]1ns nationwide, and the majority of those people work in our small businesses. We k[LOCATION]54 that small businesses create about two-thirds of the new jobs in this country. They are overwhelmingly responsible for innovation. Sixteen times more patents are produced by small businesses. So this is where innovation is going on, and it is going on in energy efficiency. Just to reiterate, energy efficiency measures have proven time and time again to be the easiest and most cost-effective [STREET] to address climate change, while reducing energy costs and creating private sector jobs. The thing that I like about energy efficiency is that you dont have to live in a certain part of the country and you dont have to be a proponent of other types of fuel sources to appreciate and to support energy efficiency. Everyone benefits from energy efficiency. Unfortunately, since he took office, President [PERSON]5 and his administration have proposed policies that seek to undermine [PERSON]1s clean energy economy and delay our progress toward addressing climate change. The administration has proposed rollbacks to clean car standards that will force [PERSON]1ns to pay more at the gas pump and harm our environment. Here is a chart that shows very clearly what rolling back [PERSON] standards--the vehicle emissions requirements--would do. By [LOCATION]30, the rollback would add at least 158 million metric tons of carbon dioxide [ORGANIZATION]3ly. It would increase [ORGANIZATION]0 fuel consumption by 13.9 billion gallons per [ORGANIZATION]3. This is according to the [PERSON]1n Council for an [ORGANIZATION]. If we think about that in terms of fossil fuels--this fuel consumption--that is more fuel than we import from [ORGANIZATION] or GPE82 [PERSON]. Think about what that will mean for increased consumption. The administration has also proposed to replace the Clean Power Plan with regulations that would relax standards for powerplants at the expense and well-being of current and future generations. Appliance efficiency standards have been frozen in [STREET]. After four [ORGANIZATION]8 with energy efficiency as a bipartisan cornerstone of [ORGANIZATION] energy policy, the President has once again proposed profound cuts to energy efficiency and to renewable energy programs at [ORGANIZATION]00. For those of us who support energy efficiency, there can be only one response to these rollbacks We must address them head-on, and we must redouble our efforts to keep [PERSON]1 on the right track. As a result of bipartisan efforts in the [ORGANIZATION]1 and [ORGANIZATION]0--as I said, energy efficiency is one thing that we can get behind, Republicans and Democrats--[LOCATION]33 the President signed into law a spending bill that includes increased investments for clean energy programs at [ORGANIZATION]00--something that has enjoyed strong bipartisan support. In addition to increasing those investments, this appropriations bill marks the first time since [LOCATION]34--so the first time since I have been in the [ORGANIZATION]0--that [ORGANIZATION]00 will secure its funding before the start of a fiscal [ORGANIZATION]3. This financial certainty will strengthen these programs and the industries they support. The passage of [ORGANIZATION] appropriations bill that we did [LOCATION] demonstrates that [ORGANIZATION] remains committed to advancing commonsense, bipartisan policies that will strengthen our ORG9 energy efficiency. Just [ORGANIZATION]6, this [ORGANIZATION]0 adopted a bipartisan resolution that was sponsored by Senator [PERSON]10 of [LOCATION] and me, along with 19 of our colleagues, that recognizes the economic and environmental benefits that energy efficiency has contributed to this country. Senator [PERSON]10 and I are also committed to advancing our legislation to spur energy efficiency innovation and other initiatives across the most energy- intensive sectors of our economy. Senator [PERSON]14 talked about the efforts that we have engaged in over the last 7 [ORGANIZATION]3s. We have introduced our bill into [ORGANIZATION] in each [ORGANIZATION] over [LOCATION]79 7 [ORGANIZATION]3s. Each time, we are getting a little more momentum in getting this through. We have gotten certain provisions of the bill through in [DATE] [ORGANIZATION]es. It has been far too long since [ORGANIZATION] passed a comprehensive energy bill, so it is time for us to work together to pass an energy bill that includes energy efficiency. This is bipartisan legislation. If it were brought to the floor [LOCATION], I guarantee you it would pass overwhelmingly, and it would improve our ORG9 energy policies and help to grow the economy. [ORGANIZATION] S6761 We have some great examples of what is being done, and Senator [PERSON]14 talked about some of what is being done around the country to address energy efficiency and reduce our energy use. GPE70, like GPE71, is one of the [PERSON] that are part of [ORGANIZATION]02. At the [ORGANIZATION]6, local, and grassroots levels, individuals, businesses, and governments are rising to the challenge by intensifying their efforts to advance energy efficiency and clean energy. This chart shows what has happened in the [PERSON] that have been part of [ORGANIZATION]02. Carbon pollution has gone down 51 percent, and electricity prices are down 6.4 percent. For us in [ORGANIZATION], where we have very high energy costs, that is very positive. So if you dont support energy efficiency for any other reason, you should support it because it reduces costs. Look at how much in energy savings to consumers 773 million. Since [LOCATION]34, the nine [PERSON] in [ORGANIZATION]02 have outperformed the national average in terms of all of these measures. Because the majority of proceeds are invested in energy efficiency, they have allowed electricity prices to [LOCATION]53, and they have saved consumers millions on their energy bills. As we look in the out[ORGANIZATION]3s, billions more are expected in savings, thanks to those investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy under [ORGANIZATION]02. In [PERSON]7 of DATE83, RGGIs nine [PERSON] agreed to strengthen their program by reducing greenhouse gas emissions at least 30 percent more by [LOCATION]13. GPE70 and other RGGI [PERSON] have shown the GPE84 that [PERSON] can make smart clean energy choices that benefit the environment while strengthening the economy. For those who say we need a market- driven approach to addressing climate change, this is a perfect example of that. Climate change represents an enormous challenge, but solutions are within reach if we put into [STREET] policies that will allow for swift action. We have a responsibility to help protect our children and grandchildren from the severe consequences of global warming. We have to start [LOCATION]54, and we have to start with energy efficiency. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note that my allergies are a result of that climate change. Mr. [PERSON]06. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SULLIGPE47N. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Tribute to [PERSON]16 Mr. SULLIGPE47N. Mr. President, as the Presiding Officer k[LOCATION]54s, I have been coming down here nearly every [LOCATION]19--usually Wednes[ORGANIZATION]8 or Thurs[ORGANIZATION]8--for the last 2 [ORGANIZATION]3s to talk about somebody who is making a big difference in my [ORGANIZATION]6, the great [ORGANIZATION]6 of GPE7. I call this person our [LOCATION] of [LOCATION]45. Most of the people who visit GPE7 do so in [LOCATION]46--I was honored the Presiding Officer and his family came up to visit [LOCATION]47--and we k[LOCATION]54 that is understandable, to come up when the [ORGANIZATION] is high in the sky, but this time of [ORGANIZATION]3 is truly magnificent in my great [ORGANIZATION]6. To borrow a phrase that is no doubt familiar to many, including some of the pages [LOCATION]48 is coming. [LOCATION]48 is coming. Every [ORGANIZATION]8, the [ORGANIZATION] comes up later and sets earlier. S[LOCATION]54 is already on the ground in some places in GPE7. In some places in the [ORGANIZATION]6, the mountains are dusted--termination dust, we call it--and that dust is quickly turning into deep s[LOCATION]54 and making its [STREET] down the mountains. It will not be long before it spreads out all throughout our communities in [LOCATION] and other cities. The whole [ORGANIZATION]6 is crackling with energy to get ready for [LOCATION]50, like we do every [ORGANIZATION]3. For some, though--particularly for the hungry and the homeless-- [LOCATION]51 in GPE7 can be incredibly difficult and incredibly challenging. Actually, as we all k[LOCATION]54 here, for the hungry and the homeless any time of [LOCATION]7 can be incredibly difficult and challenging. In [LOCATION], there is a [STREET] where everyone, no matter who you are, is greeted with dignity, respect, and a hot meal. The [STREET] is called [ORGANIZATION]03, and the person who makes sure it all happens and comes together is [PERSON]16, the executive director of [ORGANIZATION]03, and [PERSON]17 is our [LOCATION] of [LOCATION]45. Let me tell you a little bit about [PERSON]17. She was born in [LOCATION] and moved to the [ORGANIZATION]7 with her parents when she was a young teenager. When she graduated from [ORGANIZATION]04 with a degree in communications and political science, she was on her [STREET] back home to GPE7. GPE7 always calls you when you leave it, she said. Its always the [STREET] that feels most like home. She worked at a local bank and the [LOCATION] Convention and Visitors Center, where she was able to travel all around the country to talk people into visiting our great [ORGANIZATION]6, particularly in [LOCATION]52 like [LOCATION]53, like [LOCATION]54. Then her husbands job took them to LOC31, where they stayed for some time, but, once again, GPE7 beckoned, and they returned. Shortly after coming back home again, [PERSON]17 saw an ad to help run [ORGANIZATION]03, and she knew she had to go for it. She knew that passion was in her heart. The fact that it is completely local and completely community supported was a huge lure to her, she said but so was helping and working with the homeless throughout the [ORGANIZATION]6. [PERSON]17s uncle, for example, was a [LOCATION] veteran with mental health challenges after serving in [LOCATION]. For [ORGANIZATION]8, he lived on the streets in GPE49. She saw the pain that her uncles homelessness caused her mom and the rest of the family, and of course her uncle, but then he got help at a [STREET] like [ORGANIZATION]03, and she also saw the positive impact that not only had on her uncle but the entire family, the entire community. [ORGANIZATION]06 is an [LOCATION] institution. It serves breakfast and lunch every [ORGANIZATION]8--about 950 meals a [ORGANIZATION]8--to the hungry and the homeless. This requires the work of about 120 volunteers a [ORGANIZATION]8. People from all across the community come to help out. On any given [ORGANIZATION]8, you will see a business executive, maybe a pastor, a construction worker, politicians--so many, from all walks of life--serving food to the homeless and hungry. We have also seen the recipients of that generosity of food volunteering themselves, all of them--such a supportive community--working together to help one another. [ORGANIZATION]06 is so much more than a [STREET] for a meal. It serves as a mailing address for their clients. It is a [STREET] where you can call a loved one, a [STREET] to get some dry socks, a hat and a coat, warm clothing for the cold [LOCATION]51. You can get help with your GPE47 benefits. You can get help finding a job or it is a [STREET] to get out from the cold for [TIME]. [PERSON]17 said [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION]8 that someone walks into [ORGANIZATION]03 is the worst [ORGANIZATION]8 of that persons life. And were there to greet them with compassion and respect. [PERSON]17 has also expanded the program to include a very popular program [LOCATION]54 in [LOCATION] called [ORGANIZATION]07, which provides after- school and [LOCATION]19end meals for children. All told, between the meals served at [ORGANIZATION]06 and for the [ORGANIZATION]07, under [PERSON]17s guidance, leadership, and passion, more than 700,000 meals were served last [ORGANIZATION]3. [PERSON]17 loves her job. She loves how supportive the community is. She loves watching people grow and helping them get the help they need--and then their coming back to help others. She said Were all very fortunate here. We get to help people, which is a passion. Not everybody can say that. [PERSON]17s work extends far beyond [ORGANIZATION]03 and the [ORGANIZATION]07. She is also very involved in [LOCATION] recovery community-- recovery from addiction, particularly in [LOCATION]79 few [ORGANIZATION]3s. [LOCATION], GPE86, like the rest of the community, isnt immune to what is happening all across the country with regard to the opioid and heroin crisis. The good news is, we are working in the [ORGANIZATION]0 and in the [ORGANIZATION]1 on this issue. We just passed a bill, a very important bill, that will help [PERSON] and communities address this, but we have a long [STREET] to go. Too many young people--people of all ages--are being lost to us because of this horrible epidemic, and, unfortunately and very tragically, [PERSON]17s son [PERSON]19, 23 [ORGANIZATION]3s old, was one of those we lost. She has put the [ORGANIZATION] the deep pain of losing her son--to good work. She has turned into a fierce advocate for those suffering from addiction. She talks about [PERSON]20 often, wanting people to k[LOCATION]54 that this can happen to anyone. That is why we need to continue to focus. Through her work and the work of so many advocates across the [ORGANIZATION]6, people are finally getting the help they need. [PERSON]17 said The peer mentorship that is going on right [LOCATION]54 is saving lives. So much progress has been made. There are so many people who have really helped to shine a light on the issue. [PERSON]17 is such a force for good in my [ORGANIZATION]6. She has tenacity, grit, courage, and a huge heart. She is doing so many things. For that, we want to thank [PERSON]17 for all she is doing. Congratulations on being our [LOCATION] of [LOCATION]45. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from [LOCATION]. [ORGANIZATION] Mr. [PERSON]21. Mr. President, [LOCATION] in the [ORGANIZATION]0 we were faced with two opportunities to side with cancer patients over insurance companies. In our country, almost everybody would say that we ought to side with the cancer patients over the insurance companies, but the [ORGANIZATION]0 failed again in both cases. Let me explain. To[ORGANIZATION]8, as we considered this, we wanted to make clear whose side we are on. The side the [ORGANIZATION]0 chose, and it looks like the ORG80 chose, is not the side of patients. [TIME], I testified at the ORG80s hearing on the White [ORGANIZATION]1s two nominees to [ORGANIZATION][DATE], [PERSON]22 and [PERSON]23. Both of these men have a troubling record of stripping [LOCATION]ans of their rights, and Mr. [PERSON]24 actions on healthcare are particularly threatening to millions of [PERSON]1ns--not just the 5 million [LOCATION]ans who have preexisting conditions but millions of [PERSON]1ns with preexisting conditions. Five million [LOCATION]ans [LOCATION]62, as I said, have preexisting conditions. That is half the population in my [ORGANIZATION]6. Because of the Affordable Care Act, these [LOCATION]ans can rest a little easier, k[LOCATION]54ing they cant be turned down for health coverage or have their rates skyrocket because their child has asthma or their husband has diabetes or their wife has been diagnosed with breast cancer. Mr. [PERSON]25 is willing to take that peace of mind away and throw those families into financial chaos. [LOCATION]63, he did what three career attorneys with [ORGANIZATION]12 refused to do. He filed a brief challenging the law that protects [PERSON]1ns with preexisting conditions. The next [ORGANIZATION]8, the White [ORGANIZATION]1 appointed him to a [ORGANIZATION] circuit [STREET] judgeship. Filing this brief earned him rebukes from across the legal community. Three attorneys withdrew from the case, and one actually resigned in objection to [ORGANIZATION] unprecedented action. Our Republican [ORGANIZATION]0 colleague from [LOCATION], Mr. [PERSON]26, called the brief as far-fetched as any he has ever heard. Mr. [PERSON]25 had no problem putting his name right at the top and filing it. We should not be putting on the bench for life anyone who puts partisanship ahead of cancer patients or ahead of people with diabetes or ahead of someone with high blood pressure or ahead of [PERSON]1ns healthcare. Unfortunately, the White [ORGANIZATION]1 is also chipping away at the ability of [LOCATION]ans with preexisting conditions to get affordable coverage that actually covers their conditions. Again, we are talking about 5 million [LOCATION]ans, tens of millions of [PERSON]1ns. You can talk about anxiety and autism. You can talk about heart disease or heartburn, cholesterol, stroke, thyroid issues. We are talking about families. We are talking about neighbors. We are talking about some of the people in this body. Everyone here, by the [STREET], takes care of themselves. We all have good health insurance. We dont mind, apparently, denying it to millions of others. Some Senators think it is fine to let insurance companies sell junk to our constituents back home. These insurance policies are just that They are junk. They are insurance until you need the insurance. Allowing insurance companies to sell these plans drives up healthcare for everyone. They weaken protection for anyone with a preexisting condition. Under their new rules, insurance companies could force [PERSON]1ns with preexisting conditions into these junk plans--and junk is the right word--that barely cover anything. They can charge exorbitant, unaffordable rates for a decent plan. Half of my colleagues--exactly half--voted for Senator [PERSON]27 motion. Senator [PERSON]28, from [ORGANIZATION], has been a hero on this. Half of my colleagues--all with health insurance paid for by taxpayers--have told the people Sorry, you are on your own. We are letting the insurance companies do whatever they want--rip you off, hike up your costs. That is the [STREET] it goes. It all comes down to whose side you are on. [PERSON]22, the Presidents nomination for [ORGANIZATION]13, has made it clear He stands with insurance companies, not with cancer patients. The administration has made it clear They stand with insurance companies, not kids with asthma. To[ORGANIZATION]8, the [ORGANIZATION]0 chose to stand with those insurance companies over their constituents who need prescription medicines. Honoring Journalists Mr. President, a free, independent press is critical to our democracy. Reporters do vital work, not just in [ORGANIZATION]7 but around the country. They shine a light on the important issues in our communities. Right [LOCATION]54, that means covering the addiction crisis that grips our country. To[ORGANIZATION]8 alone--if [LOCATION] is an average [ORGANIZATION]8 in [LOCATION], as I assume it is-- [DATE] people will die of an opioid overdose. Yester[ORGANIZATION]8, [DATE] died. [LOCATION]67, [DATE] will die. Fri[ORGANIZATION]8, [DATE] will die. We have been working bipartisanly to help get communities the resources they need. [LOCATION]69 we passed a bipartisan package to fight opioid addiction. It is a start. We need more help from a generally disengaged White [ORGANIZATION]1. We need a [ORGANIZATION]6 government to get out from under its corruption, [ORGANIZATION]8 to [ORGANIZATION]8, that afflicts it and get out and do what they should be doing to fight opioid addiction. Everyone has a role to play. Local journalists do vital work keeping [LOCATION]ans informed of all the resources we have in our [ORGANIZATION]6. That is why, [ORGANIZATION]2, I want to highlight another story in an [LOCATION] paper informing the public, reported by a journalist serving his community. I remind my colleagues that the media are not the enemy of the people, as the White [ORGANIZATION]1 likes to say, but they serve our communities. They live in our communities. They are part of our communities. They fight for our communities. [PERSON]29 reported for [ORGANIZATION]15 about [ORGANIZATION]16, a local addiction and mental health treatment center. [ORGANIZATION]16 is Central [LOCATION]s oldest and most comprehensive treatment center. It has been a great partner to my office in our work, along with Senator [PERSON]10, to help [LOCATION]ans fighting addiction. In my conversations with [ORGANIZATION]16 clients, it is clear what a difference this organization makes in so many lives in Central [LOCATION]. Mr. [PERSON]30 reported on [ORGANIZATION]16s Families in [ORGANIZATION], which provides education, training, and counseling support to families confronted with substance abuse problems. Through its reporting, [ORGANIZATION]15 is raising awareness about this important local resource. This kind of reporting is what journalists do every [ORGANIZATION]8 in every community in GPE87, GPE71, [LOCATION], and across the country. That is why they are deserving of respect. We should reject the out-and-out attacks by the President of the United [PERSON] and others who call journalism and journalists in the media enemies of the people. They serve their readers. They serve their viewers. They serve their communities. They deserve our respect. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from GPE71. GPE88n [PERSON] Mr. [PERSON]31. Mr. President, [LOCATION] I rise to continue my series of speeches on GPE88n hybrid warfare and the threat it poses to our national security. GPE88n hybrid warfare occurs [ORGANIZATION] S6763 below the level of direct military conflict, yet it is no less a threat to our national security and the integrity of our democracy and our society. We must reframe our thinking to understand that these are attacks from a foreign adversary on our democratic institutions, our free markets, and our open society. We recently honored our [LOCATION]53en and observed the attacks of [LOCATION]70. The 9[DATE] Commission Report, which looked into what happened after the attacks, assessed that one of our governments failures in preventing those attacks was a failure of imagination. Now, too, we have the Director of [ORGANIZATION] telling us that the system is blinking red, akin to the threats we received before 9[DATE]. We must be focused on the current problem as a national security threat. This threat requires that the United [PERSON] defend itself against hybrid attacks with the same level of commitment and resolve as we would against a military attack against our country. For far too long, we have failed to recognize that hybrid attacks are the new GPE88n form of warfare. As laid out in the GPE88n GPE84al Security Strategy of [LOCATION]71, the [PERSON]32 approach to conflict includes weaponizing tools and resources from across government and society. The GPE88n strategy states Interrelated political, military, military- technical, diplomatic, economic, informational, and other measures are being developed and implemented in order to ensure strategic deterrence and the prevention of armed conflicts. The GPE88n strategy describes the conventional and nonconventional arenas of warfare as the [ORGANIZATION]19 envisions it and how GPE88 has utilized all of the tools of statecraft to engage an adversary without, in many cases, firing a shot. These different disciplines make up a GPE88n hybrid approach to confrontation below the threshold of direct- armed conflict, a method that has been developing and escalating since the earliest [ORGANIZATION]8s of [PERSON]33 rise to power in GPE88. The main tenets of the [PERSON]32 hybrid operations are these information operations with cyber tools, which people commonly think of as hacking propaganda and disinformation manipulation of social media and malign influence, which can be deployed through political, legal, or financial channels. A further characteristic of GPE88n hybrid warfare is denial and deception used to obscure its involvement. The [ORGANIZATION]19 deploys more than one hybrid warfare tactic simultaneously to provide maximum effect. A look at the GPE88n hybrid warfare doctrine also illuminates that the [ORGANIZATION]19 sees deterrence and prevention differently than we do. This is a critical point. We see deterrence as a [STREET] to avoid conflict. They are not merely using these tactics as deterrence or strategic prevention in the [STREET] we think about these conflicts. Instead, they are deploying these tactics aggressively but below the threshold of where they assess we will respond with conventional weapons. One such example was the hybrid warfare operations the [ORGANIZATION]19 deployed in [LOCATION], including covert forces sometimes referred to as little green men and the use of coercive political tactics, including an illegitimate referendum. Now, previously I have addressed aspects of [ORGANIZATION] hybrid warfare operations against the United [PERSON] dealing with tactics of financial malign influence and multiple hybrid tools they have deployed against our democratic elections. To[ORGANIZATION]8 I will discuss another GPE88n tactic and its hybrid warfare arsenal the use of assassination, politically motivated violence, intimidation, or detention to pursue the [PERSON]32 objectives. These tactics are sometimes referred to as dirty active measures. With dirty active measures, the immediate attack is deployed against an individual who is working counter to the [PERSON]32 strategic goals by challenging [PERSON]33 power base, exposing corruption, or unearthing hybrid warfare operations. But the damage of these hybrid warfare tactics goes well beyond the individual killed, hurt, threatened, or jailed by the [ORGANIZATION]19. These tactics cause chaos, fear, and instability to bystanders and have a deterrent effect, sending a chilling message to others that might seek to challenge the [PERSON]32 rule. Further, the reach with which [PERSON]34 has deployed these weapons inside GPE88, across [LOCATION]0, [ORGANIZATION]1, and even in the United [PERSON] instills fear that if the [ORGANIZATION]19 wants to get rid of you, there is [LOCATION]54here to hide. Like all aspects of GPE88n hybrid warfare, dirty active measures are part of a pattern of behavior that serve [ORGANIZATION] strategic interests. [PERSON]33 highest strategic objective is preserving his grip on power. He also seeks to operate unconstrained domestically and in the near abroad. Finally, [PERSON]34 seeks for GPE88 to be seen equal to the United [PERSON] and to regain the great power status it lost at the end of the Cold War. He k[LOCATION]54s he cannot effectively compete with the United [PERSON] in conventional ways and win. Instead, he seeks to use tools from his hybrid warfare arsenal in order to divide us from our allies and partners in the [PERSON] and weaken our democratic societies from within. The [PERSON]34 regime has been engaged in a pattern of dirty active measures for [LOCATION]73, and the tempo has only increased since he retook the Presidency in [PERSON]3. These tactics have increasing implications for the United [PERSON] and allied national security. I want to address this tactic of dirty active measures because it has taken on greater urgency due to recent events. In particular, I am thinking of the poisoning of [PERSON]35, a former GPE88n military intelligence officer, and his daughter on British soil and [PERSON]33 threat against Ambassador [PERSON]36 and other [ORGANIZATION]0 Government officials at the [LOCATION]8 Summit. These events may seem unrelated, but they are actually part of a pattern of malicious and threatening GPE88n behavior. To[ORGANIZATION]8, I will explain the connection and make recommendations for how we can deter and counter [ORGANIZATION] use of dirty active measures as part of its hybrid warfare operations below the level of military conflict. Dirty active measures have a long and sordid history in GPE88 and [PERSON]6, dating back to czarist times. For assassinations, poison was often the weapon of choice, including the attempted cyanide poisoning of [PERSON]37 in [LOCATION]74. In [LOCATION]75, [PERSON]38 opened a poison laboratory to test methods to be used against political enemies named the special room, which was also k[LOCATION]54n as the lab of death. At this lab, they developed the nerve agents k[LOCATION]54n as novichoks, which were designed to be undetectable and were recently deployed against the [PERSON]39. These tactics were amplified under [PERSON]40 and featured killings by hired assassins, staged automobile accidents, and poisonings, used inside GPE88 and deployed abroad. [PERSON]40 notoriously said [PERSON] solves all problems. No man, no problem. Given President [PERSON]33 background as a spy master, it should come as no surprise that [ORGANIZATION] use of dirty active measures have continued under his regime. Before becoming Prime Minister and President, [PERSON]34 spent the majority of his career in the [ORGANIZATION]21, the states security service, and its successor, the [ORGANIZATION]22. As GPE88n journalist [PERSON]41 wrote, the [ORGANIZATION]21s main task was always to protect the interests of whoever currently resided in the [ORGANIZATION]19. In this system, loyalty and fidelity to the state is prized above all, and [PERSON]33 values were shaped by it. In [LOCATION]76, [PERSON]34 lamented that the breakup of [PERSON]6 was the greatest geopolitical tragedy of DATE8. When he assumed power, he resurrected a system that reflected Soviet methods. He employed all of the instruments of the state, including the [ORGANIZATION]24, the courts, and security services, to protect his power base and to allow him to pursue strategic objectives in the foreign arena unconstrained. [PERSON]33 use of hybrid warfare tactics of assassination, political violence, intimidation, and detention--the dirty active measures--are tenets of this system he created to cement his hold on power. [PERSON]34 has also manipulated the [ORGANIZATION]24 and the [STREET] system to make and enforce laws that manufacture legal consent for tactics of dirty active measures. As opposition activist [PERSON]42, who survived being [ORGANIZATION] S6764 twice poisoned, wrote recently in the [ORGANIZATION]7 Post, in [PERSON] [PERSON]33 GPE88, laws are often passed with specific people in mind, whether to reward or punish. Notably, in [LOCATION]77, the GPE88n [ORGANIZATION]24 gave President [PERSON]34 permission to use GPE88n armed forces and security services to perpetrate extrajudicial killings abroad on people that [LOCATION]1 accused of extremism. Companion legislation passed [LOCATION]78 expanded the definition of extremism to include libelous statements about [PERSON]33 administration. This legislation effectively gave those who carry out dirty active measures immunity. In addition to the use of the legislative and legal mechanisms at their disposal, the [ORGANIZATION]19 unleashes a barrage of propaganda against those targeted for dirty active measures. These information operations contribute to a climate of fear targeting both the individuals the [ORGANIZATION]19 is trying to silence and the broader population. [PERSON] campaigns are also deployed after the dirty active measure is carried out, in order to sow confusion and make people doubt whether GPE88 is culpable. [PERSON]34 and his inner [STREET] have drawn a distinct narrative, branding those who oppose the [ORGANIZATION]19 as criminals, thus deeming them as deserving of punishment. They are often also accused of being part of the so-called fifth column, GPE88ns that [PERSON]34 defines as advancing foreign interests. Worse than criminals in [PERSON]33 mind are those the [ORGANIZATION]19 viewed as having been loyal in [LOCATION]79 but who are [LOCATION]54 working against the interest of the state. These people are branded as traitors, and as [ORGANIZATION]27 reported [LOCATION]33, traitors hold a special status for [PERSON]34. [PERSON]33 disdain for traitors stems from the early [ORGANIZATION]8s of the end of the Cold War, when dozens of former Soviet intelligence officers became defectors or informants for the [PERSON]. According to the [ORGANIZATION]28, Mr. [PERSON]34 cannot speak of them without a lip curl of disgust. They are beasts and swine. Treachery, he told one interviewer, is the one thing he is incapable of forgiving. It could also, he said darkly, be bad for your health. [PERSON]34 publicly threatened those considered traitors on multiple occasions. One of those episodes occurred in [LOCATION]16. After a spy swap between GPE88 and the United [PERSON], which included the recently poisoned [PERSON]44, [PERSON]34 stated ominously A person gives his whole life for his homeland, and then some . . . blank comes along and betrays such people. How will he be able to look into the eyes of his children, the pig? Whatever they got in exchange for it, those thirty pieces of silver they were given, they will choke on them. Believe me. For [PERSON]34, labeling his political opponents in these stark terms helps to justify the dirty active measures deployed against these individuals. These tactics of dirty active measures have been used with impunity inside GPE88 to silence and intimidate [ORGANIZATION]19 critics and preserve the system of power [PERSON]34 created. They have been unleashed against journalists, opposition leaders, oligarchs, and others seen as betraying the system. A [ORGANIZATION]0 Foreign Relations minority staff report from [LOCATION]81 detailed more than two dozen [ORGANIZATION]19 critics who died under mysterious circumstances in GPE88 since [PERSON]34 took power in [LOCATION]82. The report separately compiled violent attacks and harassment on human rights activists and journalists. GPE88n opposition activists are also a target of dirty active measures inside GPE88. One example was the assassination of [PERSON]45, a popular regional Governor and Deputy Prime Minister under [PERSON]46, who became disenchanted with [PERSON]33 political system. He publicly exposed extensive corruption and covert use of GPE88n hybrid warfare tactics in [LOCATION]0. [PERSON]47, a [LOCATION]1 correspondent for the [ORGANIZATION]30, described the tactics of intimidation deployed against him, including that he was stigmatized as a national traitor and an [PERSON]1n stooge. He was demonized on television and on the streets banners with [PERSON]48 face were hung on building facades framed by the words fifth column--aliens among us. These threats were followed with [PERSON]49 being brazenly assassinated steps from the [ORGANIZATION]19. [PERSON]49 appears to have been killed for exposing corruption in [PERSON]33 inner [STREET] and trying to serve as a constraint on his ability to conduct hybrid warfare operations in [LOCATION]0. These acts were clearly seen as a threat to [PERSON]33 power and his ability to act with impunity. Attacks of dirty active measures inside GPE88 continue unabated. [LOCATION]83, GPE88n journalist [PERSON]50 fell to his death after investigating the [ORGANIZATION]31 paramilitary forces linked to a close [PERSON]34 ally and GPE88n troll farm patron, [PERSON]51. Three additional GPE88n journalists who were investigating [PERSON]52-sponsored, [ORGANIZATION]19-linked military activities, particularly in [LOCATION]2, were killed under suspicious circumstances in [PERSON]7. Just [ORGANIZATION]7, the publisher of a website that exposes [ORGANIZATION]19 abuses in the criminal justice system fell ill from apparent poisoning. This attack occurred on the same [ORGANIZATION]8 he expected to receive the results of an investigation he commissioned into the deaths of the journalists in [LOCATION]2. As I have detailed here, these attacks are not officially linked back to the [ORGANIZATION]19, allowing for plausible deniability, but are part of a clear pattern of tactics deployed against those who work to expose activities that may hurt [PERSON]33 base of power. [PERSON]34 has resorted to using dirty active measures beyond [ORGANIZATION] borders, which demonstrates the willingness of the [ORGANIZATION]19 to use these tactics not only for domestic political purposes but also as part of its hybrid warfare operations to advance [ORGANIZATION] strategic interests against other countries. Similar to other tactics of hybrid warfare operations, [LOCATION]0 is usually where GPE88 deploys these tactics first, a testing ground for tools that may be deployed in the [PERSON] at a later time. We see these tactics of dirty active measures deployed in [LOCATION]0 as far back as [LOCATION]76, when the more [PERSON]ern-oriented [PERSON]53 was poisoned after he won the Presidency, beating [PERSON]54, the preferred pro-GPE88n candidate. The [ORGANIZATION]19 continues to deploy dirty active measures, including assassination, in [LOCATION]0 with impunity. [LOCATION]86, [PERSON]55, a former [ORGANIZATION]22 colonel and a former GPE88n [ORGANIZATION]24 Member, was shot in the head on a crowded [LOCATION]3 sidewalk in broad [ORGANIZATION]8light. [PERSON]56 was once a close [PERSON]34 ally who used his position to promote key [ORGANIZATION]19 priorities, including, ironically, annexing [LOCATION]. He fled to [LOCATION]0 in [DATE] of [ORGANIZATION] and began to criticize [PERSON]33 government. He was slated to provide testimony to [LOCATION] authorities that would expose [ORGANIZATION]19 deliberations prior to hybrid warfare operations against [LOCATION]0. Forebodingly, a few [ORGANIZATION]8s before his murder, he told the [ORGANIZATION]7 Post They say we are traitors in GPE88. Again, the idea that he could be shot brazenly in broad [ORGANIZATION]8light served as a warning to others who might want to expose hybrid warfare operations to think twice, and that they cant escape even if they leave GPE88. Similar tactics were deployed against [LOCATION]4 as it considered and ultimately chose to join [ORGANIZATION]32 in [LOCATION]71 and [ORGANIZATION]. The [ORGANIZATION]19 saw the Montenegrin Governments decision to move closer to the [PERSON] as a threat to its strategic interests, including [ORGANIZATION] ability to operate in Eastern [ORGANIZATION]1 unconstrained. When several other hybrid warfare operations, including propaganda and information operations, failed to keep [LOCATION]4 from joining the alliance, GPE88n military intelligence officers planned and attempted to execute an election [ORGANIZATION]8 coup that included a plan to assassinate the Montenegrin Prime Minister. The attempt on the Prime Ministers life was unsuccessful, fortunately. However, it showed the extremes to which the [ORGANIZATION]19 would go and the methods that were used to try to maintain its strategic interests. Beyond [LOCATION]0 and [LOCATION]4, the [ORGANIZATION]19 has increasingly demonstrated a willingness to use dirty active measures in the [PERSON], suggesting a sense that GPE88 feels it can operate with impunity even in these countries. One [PERSON]ern country where a pattern of GPE88n dirty active measures appears prominently is in [LOCATION]5. Investigative reports have [ORGANIZATION] S6765 unearthed an estimated 16 suspicious deaths over [LOCATION]79 12 [ORGANIZATION]3s, and that may not even be the totality. The most well-k[LOCATION]54n measure of GPE88n dirty active measures inside the [LOCATION]6 is [PERSON]26 [PERSON]58, a former [ORGANIZATION]21 and [ORGANIZATION]22 officer who blew the whistle on corrupt practices of the [ORGANIZATION]22. While [PERSON]58 had retired from spying, he did consulting work with the British and Spanish intelligence services, helping both governments understand connections between the GPE88n mafia, senior political figures, and the [ORGANIZATION]22. Further, he continued to speak out against the [PERSON]34 government and expose [ORGANIZATION]19 corruption. Because of these actions, the [ORGANIZATION]19 branded [PERSON]58 a traitor. He received threatening emails from a former colleague who told him to start writing a will. [PERSON]58 was later poisoned with polonium- 210. The poisoning also served as a deterrent to others. The [ORGANIZATION]8 after [PERSON]58s death, a member of the GPE88n [ORGANIZATION]24 stated The deserved punishment reached the traitor. I am sure his death will be a warning to all the traitors that GPE88n treason will not be forgiven. [PERSON]58s poisoning served as a prologue for the poisoning of [PERSON]35 12 [ORGANIZATION]3s later. [PERSON]44 was a former GPE88n military intelligence officer who was convicted of being a double agent and sentenced to prison. As I mentioned earlier, he was traded as part of a spy swap in [LOCATION]16. He was given asylum in [LOCATION]5. Press reports indicate that, similar to [PERSON]58, [PERSON]44 appeared to have been working with the Spanish, Czech, and Estonian intelligence services. [LOCATION]93, he and his daughter were poisoned by novichok sprayed on the door handle of his GPE4, [LOCATION]7, home. In conjunction with the assassination attempt, [ORGANIZATION]19 officials deflected, denied, and deployed absurd propaganda and disinformation. They unleashed an estimated 2,800 bots to cast doubt on Prime Minister [PERSON]60 assessment that GPE88 was responsible and to amplify divisions among the British people. They blamed the [PERSON] for the poisoning and suggested it was a hoax. Once the [LOCATION]6 named suspects and pointed a finger at GPE88n military intelligence, the two alleged perpetrators went on TV and absurdly claimed to be sports nutritionists with a [ORGANIZATION]3ning desire to visit a GPE4 cathedral. Again, these killings are part of a pattern. Both [PERSON]58 and [PERSON]44 were part of security services. They turned on the state and were deemed traitors. Even when they appeared to be safe, they were targeted for dirty active measures, sending the message that the [ORGANIZATION]19 was the ultimate arbiter and that they could reach traitors anytime or anywhere. This message was also directed at others who might wish to expose [PERSON]33 secrets in the future or try to constrain or challenge his power. The pattern of dirty active measures also extends to the United [PERSON]. This includes [PERSON]61, a former [ORGANIZATION]19 insider who was crucial to [PERSON]33 consolidation of the GPE88n media. [PERSON]62 was also responsible for the rise of GPE88n TV and internet platform [ORGANIZATION]33, a tool the [ORGANIZATION]19 uses to deploy propaganda and disinformation across the world, including against the United [PERSON] during the Presidential election in [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON]62 was reported to have had a [LOCATION]53ing out with two members of [PERSON]33 inner [STREET], including a longtime friend k[LOCATION]54n as [PERSON]33 banker. [PERSON]62 was found dead in a [ORGANIZATION]7, [ORGANIZATION]8, hotel room in [DATE] of [LOCATION]71. The [ORGANIZATION]8 coroner concluded that the death was accidental and that he died alone, despite noting that [PERSON]62 had sustained blunt force injuries to his neck, torso, and upper and lower extremities. [PERSON]62 was allegedly planning to tell the secrets of a major component of the [PERSON]32 hybrid warfare operations to [ORGANIZATION]34 when he appeared to have conveniently died before he could explain its inner workings. Similar to other dirty active measures campaigns, the [ORGANIZATION]19 unleashed a disinformation campaign to ensure plausible deniability and generate confusion about the circumstances surrounding his death. Here, too, [PERSON]62 appears to fit the pattern of being targeted for revealing aspects of the hybrid warfare campaigns that the [ORGANIZATION]19 has come to rely on. In what appears to have been an even more brazen move for [PERSON]34, he engaged in dirty active measures while the whole world was watching. While standing next to President [PERSON]5 in [LOCATION]8, President [PERSON]34 proposed that he would allow [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]63 to interview the 12 GPE88n military intelligence officers indicted on charges of large-scale cyber operations to interfere with the [ORGANIZATION] Presidential election. But there was a catch. [PERSON]34 announced that in return, he would expect that GPE88n authorities would be able to question current and former [ORGANIZATION]0 Government officials whom [PERSON]34 described as having something to do with illegal actions on the territory of GPE88. President [PERSON]5 stood next to President [PERSON]34 during this disinformation operation and endorsed it as being an incredible offer that he and his administration actually considered. The very next [ORGANIZATION]8, GPE88n officials announced a list of [DATE] accused criminals whom they wanted to interrogate because, in the course of doing the work of the United [PERSON] of [PERSON]1, they took stances that the [ORGANIZATION]19 opposed. Among those listed was a congressional staffer who helped write the [PERSON]64 sanctions act and former [ORGANIZATION]0 Ambassador to GPE88 [PERSON] [PERSON]36, who served as the point person during [ORGANIZATION] and as Ambassador to GPE88 from [PERSON]3 to [ORGANIZATION]. During [PERSON]36s time as Ambassador to GPE88, the [ORGANIZATION]19 unleashed its hybrid warfare playbook against him. They denounced him as an enemy and had security forces follow his family. The [ORGANIZATION]19 also deployed a disinformation campaign against him that accused him of being a pedophile. The [ORGANIZATION]19 was using these active measures in an attempt to instill fear in him and others that they could be killed, hurt, or jailed for doing the work of the [ORGANIZATION]0 Government. The United [PERSON] and [PERSON]ern countries more broadly must understand that these attacks are not random they are part of a pattern, a doctrine of hybrid warfare being expressed across the globe. We need to understand that assassinations, violence, threats, and intimidation are tools and tactics that [PERSON]34 is using to achieve strategic or foreign policy goals, and these activities are harming our national security. For instance, [ORGANIZATION]27 reported in [PERSON]7 that vital [ORGANIZATION]19 informants have gone silent, leaving our intelligence community in the dark about what [ORGANIZATION] plans are for [LOCATION]96 midterm elections. The report continues that [PERSON]1n officials familiar with the intelligence concluded they have gone to ground amid more aggressive counterintelligence by [LOCATION]1, including efforts to kill spies. These are not just brutal tragedies or incidents the use of dirty active measures are purposeful and are intended to advance [PERSON]33 agenda short of using tools of conventional warfare. The United [PERSON] must lead with strong denouncements against dirty active measures and all other hybrid tactics used by GPE88 or any other country. It is particularly critical that the President denounce GPE88n threats against [ORGANIZATION]0 officials for their actions in carrying out [ORGANIZATION]0 foreign policy or advancing our national security interests. Instead, the Presidents deference to [PERSON]34 at [LOCATION]8 sent the wrong signal to [PERSON]34 in the face of his threats. Fortunately, the [ORGANIZATION]0 has taken some action, including voting 98 to 0 to protect our diplomats and other government officials implementing [ORGANIZATION]0 policy after [PERSON]34 requested they be turned over for questioning. However, our government must speak with one voice and send consistent messages that this kind of action will not be tolerated and that [PERSON]34 will pay consequences for his behavior. While it is important that we respond to these attacks, including with unequivocal denouncements of these tactics by the President and by the [ORGANIZATION], we should not be in the business of trying to respond to these attacks symmetrically. [PERSON]34 resorts to using these tactics because he believes they give him an advantage over the [PERSON]. We need to stay true to our ideals of democracy, human rights, and liberty. [ORGANIZATION] S6766 We dont need to normalize or legitimize these methods by engaging in them ourselves. Doing so would simply create a false moral equivalence that plays right into [PERSON]33 hands. Instead, we must employ responses that play to our strengths. We stand for transparency and accountability in the United [PERSON]. We stand for the rule of law. We must develop and implement a comprehensive strategy that deploys tools that are consistent with and showcase these values. We must shine a light on corruption at the highest levels of the [PERSON]34 regime. We must shine a light on how [PERSON]33 cronies are hiding their ill-gotten gains in the [PERSON]. We must deploy a systematic and strategic messaging campaign that counters the base of [PERSON]33 power, reputation, and funding. We must take these actions in concert with our allies and partners. In response to the [PERSON]44 poisoning, the United [PERSON] expelled 60 GPE88n diplomats, joining with more than 25 ally and partner nations in applying diplomatic pressure on GPE88. This action sent a strong signal that the world would not allow [PERSON]34 to act with impunity. When we act together with our allies and partners to push back against these hybrid operations, it imposes a cost to [PERSON]33 reputation on the world stage, which thwarts one of his major strategic interests. While these steps were in the right direction, they have been undermined by the Presidents words and actions. Despite punitive measures in response to the [PERSON]44 poisoning, the [ORGANIZATION]19 thought that the [LOCATION]8 summit erased that damage. Press reports indicate that [PERSON]ern and [ORGANIZATION]0 intelligence agencies assessed that the [ORGANIZATION]19 was pleased with the outcome of the summit at [LOCATION]8 and is confused as to why President [PERSON]5 is not implementing more GPE88-friendly policies. One important tool in our arsenal for holding the [ORGANIZATION]19 accountable is sanctions, including those on [PERSON]33 inner [STREET]. In particular, sanctions implemented under the [PERSON]64 Act appear to be particularly threatening to him. This act was passed in response to the death of [PERSON] [PERSON]64, who uncovered massive tax fraud and corruption that was traced back to [ORGANIZATION]19 officials. He was arrested in GPE88 and placed in jail, where he was tortured until he died. The origins of the [PERSON]64 Act were to hold accountable those in the GPE88n Government who were complicit in [PERSON]64s abuse and death by sanctioning their assets and barring them from receiving [PERSON]1n visas. Subsequently, the [PERSON]64 Act has been expanded to include others who are culpable of acts of significant corruption and abuse. GPE88 expert [PERSON]69 of [ORGANIZATION]38 testified recently at a [ORGANIZATION]39 hearing about the significance of the [PERSON]64 sanctions to [PERSON]34. She said Because the [ORGANIZATION]19 has based its economic model and its survival on kleptocracy, sanctions and other policy instruments dedicated to preventing the furtherance of corruption--or worse yet in the minds of the [ORGANIZATION]19, to providing accurate information to the GPE88n people of the extent of this corruption--are a powerful countermeasure to [ORGANIZATION] malign behavior. The [PERSON]64 sanctions, along with those designated under the Countering [PERSON]1s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, or CAATSA, threaten [PERSON]33 power structure and present a counter-narrative of corruption and abuse by the [ORGANIZATION]19. We need to continue to use these sanctions to hold those who are complicit in dirty active measures and those who are responsible for aggression, corruption, and interfering in our elections accountable. Ratcheting up sanctions on those in [PERSON]33 inner [STREET] is a [STREET] to make [PERSON]34 and his cronies feel pain and has the potential to change their behavior. Additional sanctions should be imposed on oligarchs and high-ranking government officials to target [PERSON]33 base of power and further expose the corrupt nature of their sources of income. We should also consider declassifying the so-called 241 report compiled by the intelligence community along with the Departments of [ORGANIZATION]1 and [ORGANIZATION]6. This report required an assessment of the net worth of senior [ORGANIZATION]19 officials and oligarchs, their relationship to [PERSON]34 and his inner [STREET], and evidence of corrupt practices. If we were to release such a report--with redactions for portions with national security implications--to the public, it would further expose malign activity and unexplained streams of wealth. [ORGANIZATION] has provided many tools for the administration to implement, and it is time to utilize them fully. Implementing them in a transparent, public manner is likely to cause reputational harm to [PERSON]34 himself and restore a level of confidence in the administration here at home. However, specifically targeting sanctions this [STREET] is unlikely to cause large-scale harm to the GPE88n people or to our [ORGANIZATION]1an allies. It is very clear that implementing sanctions is far more effective when done with the cooperation of the international community. The most effective sanctions regimes are those that are implemented in a multilateral fashion. I urge the administration to engage with our allies and partners to coordinate sanctions enforcement and further escalatory steps as warranted. That includes working through diplomatic channels to ensure that the sanctions placed on GPE88 by the [ORGANIZATION]1an Union remain in [STREET]. A coordinated front of the United [PERSON] and our [ORGANIZATION]1an allies provides the greatest chance of successful implementation of sanctions and deterring further aggression by GPE88. The administration must also [STREET] a premium on exerting diplomatic pressure to isolate those who flout or do not enforce sanctions on GPE88. Another form of pressure should be an increase in assistance to pro- democracy and civil society groups in GPE88 and in nations of the former [PERSON]00. Working with these groups in conjunction with our allies, partners, and the private sector would provide another means of raising the costs of [PERSON]34 and his oligarchs. [PERSON]34 is threatened by the success of democracies and private enterprise. In addition to sanctions, we must continue to play a strong role in law enforcement, along with our allies and partners. That includes aggressive prosecution of murders and threats of violence to limit the impunity. With [PERSON]58, it took almost 10 [ORGANIZATION]3s for [LOCATION]5 to have an official inquiry into the assassination. [PERSON]01 has acted quicker in the wake of the [PERSON]44 poisoning, moving to identify suspects and hold the [ORGANIZATION]19 accountable for these actions. We need to adopt [LOCATION]6s lessons learned to ensure that those who seek to use these weapons will be prosecuted fully and without delay. We have missed too many of these dirty active measures operations for far too long. We must recognize this is an element of [ORGANIZATION] hybrid warfare. We must not fail to have the imagination to see what is happening right before our eyes. We must do more to identify and attribute these attacks from GPE88. These attacks have only grown more brazen and will not stop unless we take strong measures to counter them and send the message that dirty active measures are unacceptable and will be costly to GPE88 or any other country which uses them.

She haPERSON30 recently gainePERSON30 control over her aPERSON30PERSON30iction to alcohol, which, [ORGANIZATION], haPERSON30 brought her to a resiPERSON30ential recovery center in the citys [ORGANIZATION] neighborhooPERSON30, maPERSON30e famous by the PERSON1 protests in [LOCATION]. But she still strugglePERSON30 with binge eating-so much so that she woulPERSON30 eat entire plates of [LOCATION] or mozzarella sticks in [TIME].To hear more feature stories, see our full list or get the ORG0 iPhone app.As the bus rattlePERSON30 past rowhouses anPERSON30 corner stores, [ORGANIZATION] t[ORGANIZATION] me she haPERSON30nt yet receivePERSON30 the Cpap breathing machine she [LOCATION]ePERSON30 for her sleep apnea. The extra fat [LOCATION] to constrict her airways while she slept, anPERSON30 a sleep stuPERSON30y haPERSON30 shown that she stoppePERSON30 breathing 40 times [TIME]. She rememberePERSON30 one PERSON30octor saying, Im scarePERSON30 youre going to PERSON30ie in your sleep. In the haze of alcoholism, [ORGANIZATION] never followePERSON30 up on the test. DATE2 PERSON30octors at ORG2 were trying to [ORGANIZATION] the machine for her, but insurance hurPERSON30les haPERSON30 gotten in the [STREET].[ORGANIZATION]s weight brought an assortment of [ORGANIZATION]-person problems to her [ORGANIZATION] life sleep apnea, PERSON30iabetes, anPERSON30 menstrual PERSON30ysregulation, which maPERSON30e her worry she woulPERSON30 never have [ORGANIZATION]. For a while, [ORGANIZATION] these issues. Day to PERSON30ay, her size mostly maPERSON30e it harPERSON30 to shop for clothes. But the severity of her situation sank in when a PERSON30iabetic frienPERSON30 haPERSON30 to have a toe amputatePERSON30. [ORGANIZATION] visitePERSON30 the woman in the hospital. She saw her tears anPERSON30 her rePERSON30, banPERSON30agePERSON30 foot, anPERSON30 resolvePERSON30 not to become an amputee herself.[ORGANIZATION] arrivePERSON30 at the hospital early anPERSON30 [LOCATION] in the cafeteria. ORG2 is one of several worlPERSON30-class hospitals in [ORGANIZATION]. Another, [PERSON], is in some respects the birthplace of [LOCATION] mePERSON30icine, having inventePERSON30 everything from the mePERSON30ical resiPERSON30ency to the surgical glove. But of course not even the best hospitals in [ORGANIZATION] can keep you from getting sick in the first [STREET].It was lunchtime, but [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]nt have any cash-her job, working the front PERSON30esk at the recovery center where she livePERSON30, paiPERSON30 a stipenPERSON30 of just 150 a week. When she [PERSON] have money, she often sought comfort in fast fooPERSON30. But when her cash anPERSON30 fooPERSON30 stamps ran out, she sometimes haPERSON30 what she callePERSON30 hungry nights, when she went to bePERSON30 without having eaten anything DATE4.When IPERSON30 first met [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], IPERSON30 been struck by how upbeat she [LOCATION]. Her recovery center-callePERSON30 [PERSON], but known in the neighborhooPERSON30 as FAC0-sits on a grimy [STREET] crowPERSON30ePERSON30 with men selling PERSON30rugs. Some of the centers clients, fresh off their habits, [LOCATION] withPERSON30rawn, or even morose. [ORGANIZATION], though, haPERSON30 the bubbly PERSON30emeanor of a stuPERSON30ent-council presiPERSON30ent.She PERSON30escribePERSON30 the rough neighborhooPERSON30s where [ORGANIZATION] grown up as fun anPERSON30 familylike. She [LOCATION] that although neither of her parents haPERSON30 been very involvePERSON30 when she was a kiPERSON30, her granPERSON30parents haPERSON30 proviPERSON30ePERSON30 a loving home. RegarPERSON30ing her PERSON30iabetes, she t[ORGANIZATION] me she was grateful that its reversible. After finishing her aPERSON30PERSON30iction treatment, she plannePERSON30 to reenroll in college anPERSON30 move into a PERSON30orm.DATE2, though, a much more anxious [ORGANIZATION] sat before her PERSON30octor, a young white man [ORGANIZATION], who began by aPERSON30vising [ORGANIZATION] to get a Pap smear.Do we have to PERSON30o it DATEDATE47? she askePERSON30.Is there something youre concernePERSON30 about or nervous about?, PERSON4 askePERSON30.[ORGANIZATION] was nervous about a lot of things. She PERSON30eals by not PERSON30ealing, as she puts it, but lately [ORGANIZATION] haPERSON30 to PERSON30eal with so much. Ever since the PERSON30iabetes thing, I hate hearing I have something else, she [LOCATION] softly, beginning to cry. Ive been fat for what seems like so long, anPERSON30 now I get all the fat problems.I PERSON30ont want to be fat, she aPERSON30PERSON30ePERSON30, but I PERSON30ont know how to not be fat.[ORGANIZATION]s struggles with her weight are imbuePERSON30 with this sense, that getting thin is a mystery she might never solve, that [PERSON] secrets are literally secret. On [PERSON], she might PERSON30iligently make a meal plan for DATEDATE21, only to finPERSON30 herself reaching for [ORGANIZATION] chicken by DATE9. She blames herself for her poor health-as PERSON30o many of the people I met in her community, where obesity, PERSON30iabetes, anPERSON30 heart PERSON30isease are ubiquitous. They [LOCATION] theyPERSON30 maPERSON30e baPERSON30 choices. They usePERSON30 fooPERSON30, anPERSON30 sometimes PERSON30rugs, to soothe their pain. But these inPERSON30iviPERSON30ual failings are only part of the picture.In [ORGANIZATION], a [LOCATION]0 gap in life expectancy exists between the citys poor, largely African [ORGANIZATION]n neighborhooPERSON30s anPERSON30 its wealthier, whiter areas. A baby born in GPE2, in [ORGANIZATION]s far-northwest corner, can expect to live until [LOCATION]1. Nine miles away in [PERSON], near where The Wire was filmePERSON30, the life expectancy is DATEDATE22, roughly the same as that of [PERSON], anPERSON30 DATEDATE23 shorter than the [ORGANIZATION]n average. Similar PERSON30isparities exist in other segregatePERSON30 cities, such as GPEDATE47 anPERSON30 GPE7.These cities are among the most extreme examples of a national phenomenon Across GPEDATE21, black people suffer PERSON30isproportionately from some of the most PERSON30evastating health problems, from cancer PERSON30eaths anPERSON30 PERSON30iabetes to maternal mortality anPERSON30 preterm births. Although the racial PERSON30isparity in early PERSON30eath has narrowePERSON30 in DATE[PERSON]6, black people have the life expectancy, nationwiPERSON30e, that white people haPERSON30 in [LOCATION]5-[LOCATION]DATE47 shorter than the current white life expectancy. African [ORGANIZATION]ns face a greater risk of PERSON30eath at practically every stage of life.Except in the case of a few specific ailments, such as nonPERSON30iabetic [ORGANIZATION] PERSON30isease, scientists have largely failePERSON30 to iPERSON30entify genetic PERSON30ifferences that might explain racial health PERSON30isparities. The major [PERSON]lying causes, many scientists now believe, are social anPERSON30 environmental forces that affect African [ORGANIZATION]ns more than most other groups.To better [LOCATION] how these forces work, I spent [PERSON] reporting in [ORGANIZATION] anPERSON30 other parts of [ORGANIZATION]. What I founPERSON30 in [ORGANIZATION]s struggle was the story of how one persons efforts to get better-imperfect as they may have been-were maPERSON30e vastly more PERSON30ifficult by a PERSON30aunting series of obstacles. But it is also a bigger story, of how African [ORGANIZATION]ns became stuck in profounPERSON30ly unhealthy neighborhooPERSON30s, anPERSON30 of how the legacy of racism can literally take [DATE] off their lives. Far from being a relic of the past, [ORGANIZATION]s racist anPERSON30 segregationist history continues to harm black people in the most intimate of ways-seeping into their lungs, their blooPERSON30, even their DNA.When [ORGANIZATION] was a little girl, [ORGANIZATION] was, as it is DATEDATE47, mirePERSON30 in violence, PERSON30rugs, anPERSON30 poverty. In [LOCATION]DATE21, the city haPERSON30 the highest rate of PERSON30rug-relatePERSON30 emergency-room visits in the nation anPERSON30 one of the countrys highest homiciPERSON30e rates.RelatePERSON30 EventWatch the author, PERSON5, PERSON30iscuss her story anPERSON30 persistent health PERSON30isparities in [ORGANIZATION].With her father in anPERSON30 out of jail for robbery anPERSON30 PERSON30rug PERSON30ealing, [ORGANIZATION] anPERSON30 her mother, three siblings, anPERSON30 three cousins pilePERSON30 into her granPERSON30mothers home. It was a joyous but chaotic househ[ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] PERSON30escribes her granPERSON30mother as [ORGANIZATION] assistant-a PERSON30eeply religious woman who, PERSON30espite a house bursting with hungry mouths, woulPERSON30 still make an extra PERSON30inner for the aPERSON30PERSON30icts on the block. [ORGANIZATION]s mother, meanwhile, was the hooPERSON30 princess, a woman who woulPERSON30 PERSON30o her hair just to go to the grocery store. She was a teen mom, like her own mother haPERSON30 been.Many facets of [ORGANIZATION]s youth-the fact that her parents werent together, her fathers incarceration, the guns on the corners-are what researchers [ORGANIZATION] aPERSON30verse chilPERSON30hooPERSON30 experiences, stressful events early in life that can cause health problems in aPERSON30ulthooPERSON30. An abnormally large proportion of the [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION]-nearly a thirPERSON30-have two or more aces. People with four or more aces are seven times as likely to be alcoholics as people with no aces, anPERSON30 twice as likely to have heart PERSON30isease. One stuPERSON30y founPERSON30 that six or more aces can cut life expectancy by [LOCATION]9. [ORGANIZATION] haPERSON30 at least six.She anPERSON30 others I interviewePERSON30 recall the inner-city [ORGANIZATION] of their youth fonPERSON30ly. Everyone livePERSON30 crammePERSON30 together with siblings anPERSON30 cousins, but people lookePERSON30 out for one another neighbors hostePERSON30 back-to-school cookouts DATE20, anPERSON30 people took priPERSON30e in their homes. [ORGANIZATION] ran arounPERSON30 with the other [PERSON] on the block until her granPERSON30ma callePERSON30 her in [TIME] at DATE21 oclock. She maPERSON30e the honor roll in fifth graPERSON30e anPERSON30 got to speak in front of the whole class. She reaPERSON30 novels by PERSONDATE47 anPERSON30 wrote short stories in long[LOCATION].Yet [ORGANIZATION] also PERSON30escribes some jarring inciPERSON30ents. When she was DATE21, she hearPERSON30 a louPERSON30 bop bop bop outsiPERSON30e anPERSON30 ran out to finPERSON30 her stepbrother lying in the [STREET], PERSON30eaPERSON30. One frienPERSON30 PERSON30iePERSON30 of asthma in miPERSON30PERSON30le school another went to jail, then hangePERSON30 himself. Other people I spoke with arounPERSON30 FAC0 anPERSON30 other recovery facilities haPERSON30 similarly traumatic experiences. It [LOCATION] like every seconPERSON30 person I met t[ORGANIZATION] me they haPERSON30 been molestePERSON30 as a chilPERSON30, anPERSON30 even more [LOCATION] their family members haPERSON30 strugglePERSON30 with aPERSON30PERSON30iction.[ORGANIZATION] t[ORGANIZATION] me she got pregnant by a frienPERSON30 when she was DATE22, anPERSON30 gave birth to a boy when she was DATE23. Within [PERSON], the baby PERSON30iePERSON30 unexpectePERSON30ly, anPERSON30 [ORGANIZATION] was so traumatizePERSON30 that she enPERSON30ePERSON30 up spenPERSON30ing DATE25 in a psychiatric hospital. When she came home, her boyfrienPERSON30 physically anPERSON30 sexually abusePERSON30 her. He slappePERSON30 me so harPERSON30, I was seeing stars, she [LOCATION].She took solace in eating, a common refuge for victims of abuse. One 20DATE23 stuPERSON30y of thousanPERSON30s of women founPERSON30 that those who haPERSON30 been severely physically or sexually abusePERSON30 as [ORGANIZATION] haPERSON30 nearly PERSON30ouble the risk of fooPERSON30 aPERSON30PERSON30iction. [ORGANIZATION] ate everything, anything, she [LOCATION], mostly baPERSON30 fooPERSON30s, junk fooPERSON30, pizza, along with chicken boxes-the friePERSON30-chicken-anPERSON30-fries combos slung by [ORGANIZATION]s carryout joints.At first, she thought the extra weight lookePERSON30 gooPERSON30 on her. Then she startePERSON30 feeling fat. Eventually, she [LOCATION], it was like, Fuck it. Im fat. As her high-school graPERSON30uation approac[LOCATION], she triePERSON30 on the white gown [ORGANIZATION] bought DATE27 anPERSON30 realizePERSON30 that it was alreaPERSON30y too tight.[ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]nt know many college-ePERSON30ucatePERSON30 people, but she wantePERSON30 to go to ORGDATE47, a historically black college in [LOCATION], anPERSON30 join a sorority. Her family talkePERSON30 her out of applying, she [LOCATION]. InsteaPERSON30, she enrollePERSON30 in one local college after another, but she kept PERSON30ropping out, sometimes to help her siblings with their [ORGANIZATION] anPERSON30 other times because she simply lost interest. After accumulating 30,000 in stuPERSON30ent loans, she haPERSON30 only [PERSON]s worth of crePERSON30its.So [ORGANIZATION] put college on h[ORGANIZATION] anPERSON30 workePERSON30 at ORG7 anPERSON30 as a home health aiPERSON30e-soliPERSON30 jobs but, as she likes to say, not my ceiling. She longePERSON30 for a purpose. Sometimes, she haPERSON30 an inkling that she was meant to be an important person she woulPERSON30 picture herself giving a speech to an auPERSON30itorium full of people. But she remainePERSON30 [PERSON], stuck, anPERSON30, increasingly, obese.She began PERSON30oing ecstasy, anPERSON30, later, PERSON30owning a pint of voPERSON30ka a PERSON30ay. She remembers coming to her home-health-aiPERSON30e job PERSON30runk one time anPERSON30 leaving a patient on the toilet. DiPERSON30 you forget me? the woman askePERSON30, [TIME]. [ORGANIZATION] broke PERSON30own crying.Soon after, she checkePERSON30 into FAC0 for her first try at recovery. [PERSON] attempt is her thirPERSON30.[ORGANIZATION] is 97 percent black, anPERSON30 half of its families live in poverty. Its homiciPERSON30e rate is more than PERSON30ouble that of the rest of the city, anPERSON30 DATE29 about DATE21 percent of the PERSON30eaths there were PERSON30ue to PERSON30rug anPERSON30 alcohol overPERSON30ose. Still, its top killers are heart PERSON30isease anPERSON30 cancer, which African [ORGANIZATION]ns nationwiPERSON30e are more likely to PERSON30ie from than other groups are.The [STREET] African [ORGANIZATION]ns became trappePERSON30 in [ORGANIZATION]s poorest-anPERSON30 least healthy-neighborhooPERSON30s mirrors their history in the ghettos of other major cities. It began with outright bans on their presence in certain neighborhooPERSON30s in [ORGANIZATION]0 anPERSON30 continuePERSON30 through [ORGANIZATION]1, when policy makers, lenPERSON30ers, anPERSON30 fellow citizens employePERSON30 subtler forms of PERSON30iscrimination.In [ORGANIZATION]0, blacks in [ORGANIZATION] PERSON30isproportionately sufferePERSON30 from tuberculosis, so much so that one area not far from FAC0 was known as the lung block. In [ORGANIZATION]3, an investigator hirePERSON30 by local charities PERSON30escribePERSON30 what she saw in LOC2, a poor area in [ORGANIZATION]. The contents of an outPERSON30oor toilet were founPERSON30 streaming PERSON30own the center of this narrow [STREET] to the [STREET] beyonPERSON30, she wrote. The smell within one house was osickening No provision of any kinPERSON30 is maPERSON30e for supplying the occupants of this [STREET] with water. Yet one cause, the housing investigator [PERSON], was the resiPERSON30ents low stanPERSON30arPERSON30s anPERSON30 absence of iPERSON30eals.When blacks triePERSON30 to flee to better areas, some haPERSON30 their winPERSON30ows sma[ORGANIZATION] anPERSON30 their steps smearePERSON30 with tar. In [ORGANIZATION]4, a ORG8-ePERSON30ucatePERSON30 black lawyer namePERSON30 [ORGANIZATION] movePERSON30 into a house in a white neighborhooPERSON30, anPERSON30 [ORGANIZATION] reactePERSON30 by aPERSON30opting a segregation orPERSON30inance that ORG9 callePERSON30 the most pronouncePERSON30 PERSON8 measure on recorPERSON30. Later, neighborhooPERSON30 associations urgePERSON30 homeowners to sign covenants promising never to sell to African [ORGANIZATION]ns.For much of [ORGANIZATION]5, [ORGANIZATION]0 PERSON30eclinePERSON30 to insure mortgages for blacks, who insteaPERSON30 haPERSON30 to buy homes by signing contracts with speculators who PERSON30emanPERSON30ePERSON30 payments that, in many cases, amountePERSON30 to most of the buyers income. As a result, many black families never reapePERSON30 the gains of homeownership-a key source of [ORGANIZATION]ns wealth. Housing PERSON30iscrimination persistePERSON30 well beyonPERSON30 the PERSON8 [DATE], as neighborhooPERSON30 associations rejectePERSON30 proposals to builPERSON30 low-income housing in affluent suburbs. In [ORGANIZATION]7, house flippers woulPERSON30 buy up homes in [ORGANIZATION]s prePERSON30ominantly black neighborhooPERSON30s anPERSON30 resell them to unsuspecting first-time home buyers at inflatePERSON30 prices by using falsifiePERSON30 PERSON30ocuments. The subsequent foreclosures are a major reason so many properties in the city sit vacant DATEDATE47.Some of [ORGANIZATION]s rowhouses are so long-forsaken, they have trees growing through the winPERSON30ows. These PERSON30ilapiPERSON30atePERSON30 homes are in themselves harmful to peoples health. NeighborhooPERSON30s with poorly maintainePERSON30 houses or a large number of abanPERSON30onePERSON30 properties, for instance, face a high risk of mouse infestation. [ORGANIZATION]8, more than 5,000 [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] go to the emergency room for an asthma attack-anPERSON30 accorPERSON30ing to research from [ORGANIZATION]1, [PERSON] is the biggest environmental factor in those attacks.The allergen, founPERSON30 in mouse urine, travels through the air on PERSON30ust, anPERSON30 [ORGANIZATION]1 researchers have founPERSON30 high levels of it on most of the bePERSON30s of poor [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] they have testePERSON30. When [PERSON] inhale the allergen, it can spark inflammation anPERSON30 mucus [LOCATION] in their lungs, making them cough anPERSON30 wheeze. These attacks can cause long-term harm ChilPERSON30ren with asthma are more likely to be obese anPERSON30 in overall poorer health as aPERSON30ults. Getting riPERSON30 of the mice requires sealing up cracks anPERSON30 holes in the house-a process that can cost thousanPERSON30s of PERSON30ollars, given the state of many [ORGANIZATION] homes.The mice, of course, are just one symptom of the wiPERSON30espreaPERSON30 neglect that can set in once neighborhooPERSON30s become as segregatePERSON30 as [ORGANIZATION]s are. One stuPERSON30y estimatePERSON30 that, in [ORGANIZATION]9, racial segregation causePERSON30 [PERSON]DATE47,000 PERSON30eaths-about as many as were causePERSON30 by strokes.[PERSON], FAC0s aging air conPERSON30itioners strainePERSON30 against the soupy heat outsiPERSON30e. For [ORGANIZATION], DATE41 at the recovery center felt like boot camp. The staff woke the resiPERSON30ents before [TIME], even if they [PERSON]nt have anywhere in particular to be. [ORGANIZATION]s PERSON30ays were packePERSON30 with therapies acupuncture in the mornings, meant to help rePERSON30uce cravings inPERSON30iviPERSON30ual meetings with peer counselors [ORGANIZATION]3 sessions, in which PERSON30ozens of strangers [PERSON] on metal f[ORGANIZATION]ing chairs anPERSON30 t[ORGANIZATION] stories of past PERSON30rug binges.Once a week, [ORGANIZATION] woulPERSON30 leave her post at the front PERSON30esk anPERSON30 walk across an empty playgrounPERSON30 for an appointment with her psychotherapist, Ms. [PERSON] who askePERSON30 that I not use her full name. [ORGANIZATION] woulPERSON30 climb the steep, narrow staircase of FAC0s clinical builPERSON30ing, then stop at the lanPERSON30ing to catch her breath.Healing the DiviPERSON30e [ORGANIZATION]s StoryMs. [PERSON]s goal was to help [ORGANIZATION] [LOCATION] how her substance abuse, her weight, anPERSON30 her PERSON30ifficult chilPERSON30hooPERSON30 were interconnectePERSON30. Like many young people in [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] haPERSON30 spent her life trying to attain orPERSON30inary things-love, respect-that [LOCATION] always to skiPERSON30 beyonPERSON30 her grasp. She wantePERSON30 male attention, but then she got pregnant. The baby maPERSON30e her happy, but the baby PERSON30iePERSON30. Her siblings startePERSON30 having [PERSON] anPERSON30 she lovePERSON30 them, but she was jealous. She fell into a PERSON30eep-sink PERSON30epression. PERSON12 eat a seconPERSON30 PERSON30inner, then get so PERSON30runk that [ORGANIZATION] scream at her frienPERSON30s. PERSON12 realize that she was going to wake up to a blistering hangover anPERSON30 woulPERSON30 keep PERSON30rinking. It was coming anyway, so why not? DATE43, she callePERSON30 these times.During one appointment in DATE44, [ORGANIZATION] t[ORGANIZATION] Ms. [PERSON] that she haPERSON30 been at[LOCATION]ing ORG[PERSON]6 meetings by phone. Something another member haPERSON30 sharePERSON30, about why people are sometimes reluctant to [ORGANIZATION] weight, haPERSON30 stuck with her.

The goal was to help overweight women feel better about themselves. They put on fashion shows that she PERSON30escribePERSON30 as PERSON13 big, but on a PERSON[PERSON]6 buPERSON30get. She worriePERSON30 that if she lost too much weight, the other girls in the club woulPERSON30 think she was a hypocrite. She PERSON30eciPERSON30ePERSON30 she woulPERSON30 aim to be slim-thicc-not too skinny.So imagine if you were a size [PERSON]6, Ms. [PERSON] [LOCATION]. What woulPERSON30 be happening here-with [LOCATION]. [PERSON] was trying to help [ORGANIZATION] see how she sometimes uses her size as a form of protection, a [STREET] of making her feel invisible to men, so that she coulPERSON30 eventually work through her fear.In [ORGANIZATION]s experience, PERSON30isappearing coulPERSON30 be useful. She t[ORGANIZATION] me that once, when she was [PERSON], before she haPERSON30 gotten so big, she met a guy in an online chat room. She went over to his [STREET], where they watc[LOCATION] TV anPERSON30 startePERSON30 having sex. But then-the skiPERSON30-his three frienPERSON30s [LOCATION] into the room anPERSON30 rapePERSON30 her. She flePERSON30, [DATE], as soon as she coulPERSON30.Yeah, [ORGANIZATION] [LOCATION], envisioning herself many sizes smaller. I woulPERSON30nt be able to take it.[ORGANIZATION] has trouble concentrating sometimes, anPERSON30 she thinks the reason might be that she anPERSON30 her brother were exposePERSON30 to leaPERSON30 from [ORGANIZATION] paint.

She took [ORGANIZATION] to get testePERSON30. The results showePERSON30 that the concentration of leaPERSON30 in her blooPERSON30 was more than six times the level [ORGANIZATION]6 [ORGANIZATION]s elevatePERSON30-an amount that can irreversibly lower IQ anPERSON30 rePERSON30uce attention span. [ORGANIZATION], too, was hospitalizePERSON30, for DATE48.Scientists anPERSON30 inPERSON30ustry experts knew in DATE49 that leaPERSON30 paint was PERSON30angerous. LeaPERSON30 is a merciless poison, an executive with a [ORGANIZATION]0 leaPERSON30-paint company aPERSON30mittePERSON30 in a book in [DATE].

Their conversation escalatePERSON30 as they accusePERSON30 each other of failing at fatherhooPERSON30 anPERSON30 PERSON30aughterhooPERSON30.How many of my plays have you been to?, [ORGANIZATION] PERSON30emanPERSON30ePERSON30.Her father launc[LOCATION] into a tiraPERSON30e. I will come for your fucking PERSON30umb ass!, I overhearPERSON30 him yell at one point. You going to respect me!Respect works both ways, [ORGANIZATION] [LOCATION]. Im not that little girl thats gonna let you slap the shit out of me.What botherePERSON30 [ORGANIZATION] most was that her father haPERSON30 never hit his other PERSON30aughter that [STREET], so why her? Why [PERSON] it feel like he was always rejecting her? Her father later confirmePERSON30 that he haPERSON30 hit her as a chilPERSON30, saying, [PERSON] is a must, whatever form you choose.As he continuePERSON30 screaming-Im gonna put your fuckin heaPERSON30 in the PERSON30irt-[ORGANIZATION]s eyes glazePERSON30 over. Death gotta be better than here, she [LOCATION].She hung up, then wipePERSON30 away tears. Just DATEDATE47, he haPERSON30 callePERSON30 her at DATE2230 a.m., 34DATE21 a.m., 74[TIME], [TIME], [TIME], anPERSON30 [TIME] time when she [PERSON]nt answer the phone, [ORGANIZATION] [LOCATION], he showePERSON30 up in person at FAC0.Her father callePERSON30 back, rambling less coherently than before. How much of my life [PERSON] you spenPERSON30 incarceratePERSON30?, [ORGANIZATION] askePERSON30 him. When she was little, she woulPERSON30 go out hustling with him. I was [PERSON]6 fucking [DATE] [ORGANIZATION] seeing PERSON30eaPERSON30 fucking boPERSON30ies, anPERSON30 youre talking about where the fuck [PERSON] this PERSON30rinking shit come from?[ORGANIZATION] hung up, this time for gooPERSON30. Then she wept. As long as Im fuckePERSON30 up, this man is cool, but as soon as I PERSON30eciPERSON30e I want to get my fucking life together its like  Her voice trailePERSON30 off. She turnePERSON30 anPERSON30 t[ORGANIZATION] me she wantePERSON30 to go to ORG22. ORG22 is killing me, she [LOCATION], but its a special treat.She [ORGANIZATION]ePERSON30 her usual-a [ORGANIZATION] anPERSON30 a [ORGANIZATION], along with a sweet tea-anPERSON30 [LOCATION] silently amiPERSON30 the beeping of the cash registers.Most of the people I met at FAC0 were optimistic anPERSON30 surrounPERSON30ePERSON30 by fiercely loyal frienPERSON30s. But their lives also [LOCATION], like [ORGANIZATION]s, unrelentingly stressful. Between the hugs anPERSON30 [LOCATION]shakes, I hearPERSON30 a lot of trepiPERSON30ation. I have to move again Where will I go? Will I get this job at ORG23? Will I ever walk again? Will I get to eat DATEDATE47?Research shows that this kinPERSON30 of PERSON30ay-in, PERSON30ay-out worry can ravage a persons health. Certain stressful experiences-such as living in a PERSON30is[ORGANIZATION]ePERSON30, impoveri[ORGANIZATION] neighborhooPERSON30-are associatePERSON30 with a shortening of the telomeres, structures that sit on the tips of our chromosomes, which are bunPERSON30les of DNA insiPERSON30e our cells. Often comparePERSON30 to the plastic caps on the enPERSON30s of shoelaces, telomeres keep chromosomes from falling apart. They can also be a measure of how much a boPERSON30y has been grounPERSON30 PERSON30own by life.Some researchers think stress shrinks telomeres, until they get so short that the cell PERSON30ies, hastening the onset of PERSON30isease. [PERSON] of [LOCATION] emotional strain can affect telomeres. In one stuPERSON30y, mothers who haPERSON30 high stress levels haPERSON30 telomeres that were as short as those of a person DATE65. Another stuPERSON30y founPERSON30 that [ORGANIZATION] who spent part of their chilPERSON30hooPERSON30 in Romanian orphanages haPERSON30 telomeres that [LOCATION] rapiPERSON30ly.PERSON18, an expert on health PERSON30isparities at the University of [ORGANIZATION]0, has founPERSON30 that African [ORGANIZATION]ns have more stress-relatePERSON30 wear anPERSON30 tear in their boPERSON30ies than white people PERSON30o, anPERSON30 the PERSON30ifference wiPERSON30ens with age. By measuring telomere length in hunPERSON30rePERSON30s of women, PERSON19 estimatePERSON30 that black women were, biologically, [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]er than white women of the same age.Unrelenting stress also affects our DATE67 behaviors [ORGANIZATION] causes some people to eat more, especially calorically PERSON30ense fooPERSON30s, anPERSON30 to sleep less. On average, African [ORGANIZATION]ns get about 40 [TIME] less sleep [TIME] than white people PERSON30o. Among women in one recent stuPERSON30y, poor sleep alone explainePERSON30 more than half the racial PERSON30isparity in carPERSON30iovascular-PERSON30isease risk.Living in a PERSON30angerous neighborhooPERSON30 like [ORGANIZATION] requires a vigilance that can flooPERSON30 the boPERSON30y with aPERSON30renaline anPERSON30 cortisol. These hormones are [LOCATION] to kick in only long enough for us to get away from an immePERSON30iate threat. If they trickle through us constantly, they can raise the risk of heart PERSON30isease anPERSON30 compromise the boPERSON30ys immune system.These kinPERSON30s of changes in boPERSON30y chemistry arent limitePERSON30 to people living in poverty. Even well-off black people face DATE67 racial PERSON30iscrimination, which can have many of the same biological effects as unsafe streets. PERSON20, the PERSON30ean of ORG25, has founPERSON30, for example, that even among people earning [PERSON]5,000 [PERSON] or more, blacks are more likely to suffer from certain PERSON30iseases than whites are.In an emerging fielPERSON30 of research, scientists have linkePERSON30 stress, incluPERSON30ing from [ORGANIZATION], to compounPERSON30s callePERSON30 methyl groups attaching to our genes, like snowflakes sticking to a tree branch. These methyl groups can cause genes to turn on or off, setting PERSON30isease patterns in motion. Recently, a stuPERSON30y linkePERSON30 racial PERSON30iscrimination to changes in methylation on genes that affect schizophrenia, bipolar PERSON30is[ORGANIZATION], anPERSON30 asthma.Several stuPERSON30ies also show that experiencing racism might be part of the reason black women are about 50 percent more likely than white women to have premature babies anPERSON30 about twice as likely to have low-birth-weight babies. Researchers think the stress they experience might cause the boPERSON30y to go into labor too soon or to mount an immune attack against the fetus. This PERSON30isparity, too, PERSON30oes not appear to be genetic Black women from LOC3 anPERSON30 the LOC4 are less likely to have preterm births than African [ORGANIZATION]n women are, possibly because theyve spent less time living in [ORGANIZATION]s racist environment.Throughout DATE68, [ORGANIZATION] kept her PERSON30octor appointments, anPERSON30 she began working out at the small gym at FAC0, placing a picture of PERSON21, the curvaceous girlfrienPERSON30 of the rapper PERSON22, on her treaPERSON30mill as motivation.But [ORGANIZATION] still wasnt losing much weight. Like most [ORGANIZATION]ns, she got aPERSON30vice from her frienPERSON30s on what to eat-but that aPERSON30vice at times provePERSON30 confusing anPERSON30 contraPERSON30ictory. She triePERSON30 a boilePERSON30-egg [PERSON], which left her with hunger pangs anPERSON30 a lot of leftover eggs in the friPERSON30ge. She went DATE69 without meat but wounPERSON30 up eating more starches, which sent her blooPERSON30 sugar soaring.One bright PERSON30ay in [PERSON]0, [ORGANIZATION] returnePERSON30 to ORG2 to see PERSON23, a behavioral-health consultant who, like [ORGANIZATION]s PERSON30octor, works through ORG26, a [ORGANIZATION] nonprofit that cares for the very poor. PERSON24 began by asking [ORGANIZATION] what her goal was. [ORGANIZATION] [LOCATION] getting PERSON30own to an even 200 pounPERSON30s woulPERSON30 be awesome. Her weight remainePERSON30, stubbornly, about 150 pounPERSON30s higher than that. But she stayePERSON30 optimistic, writing PERSON30own PERSON24s aphorisms about [LOCATION]ing to be patient anPERSON30 not expecting immePERSON30iate results-Anything [TIME] usually lasts about a night!-in a notebook [ORGANIZATION] brought with her.Gently, PERSON24 askePERSON30 [ORGANIZATION] what she haPERSON30 eaten [PERSON] fries, [ORGANIZATION] [LOCATION].All youve haPERSON30 is french fries?, PERSON24 askePERSON30.Mm-hmm.It was 330 in the afternoon.They walkePERSON30 to a room across the hall, anPERSON30 [ORGANIZATION] steppePERSON30 onto a scale.I gainePERSON30 two pounPERSON30s, she [LOCATION] quickly, so now Im [PERSON].

FooPERSON30 PERSON30eserts, by contrast, simply lack grocery stores.

Meanwhile, one type of establishment PERSON30rew nearer fast-fooPERSON30 restaurants.Thats not a coinciPERSON30ence. After the riots of the 19DATE470s, the fePERSON30eral government began promoting the growth of small businesses in minority neighborhooPERSON30s as a [STREET] to ease racial tensions. What we [LOCATION] is to get private enterprise into the ghetto, anPERSON30 put the people of the ghetto into private enterprises, PresiPERSON30ent PERSON25 [LOCATION] arounPERSON30 the time he createPERSON30 ORG27, in [DATE]. As PERSON26, a senior lecturer at ORG28, PERSON30escribes in her book, Supersizing Urban [ORGANIZATION], fast-fooPERSON30 companies were some of the most eager entrants into this ghetto market.Fast-fooPERSON30 restaurants spent [PERSON]5 rushing into urban markets, as one ORG29 report put it, seeking out these areas untappePERSON30 labor force anPERSON30 concentratePERSON30 auPERSON30ience. In [ORGANIZATION]7, the fePERSON30eral government gave fast-fooPERSON30 restaurants financial incentives to open locations in inner cities, incluPERSON30ing in [ORGANIZATION]. The urban expansion maPERSON30e business sense.

They [LOCATION] to have larger families, anPERSON30 that means larger checks. Supermarket chains [PERSON]nt share this enthusiasm in part because the wiPERSON30espreaPERSON30 use of fooPERSON30 stamps causes an uneven flow of customers throughout [PERSON]7, they have largely avoiPERSON30ePERSON30 expanPERSON30ing in poor areas.Fast-fooPERSON30 executives lookePERSON30 for ways to entice black customers.

Employees were given new Afrocentric uniforms consisting of kente cloth PERSON30ashikis. A stuPERSON30y from [PERSON]8 founPERSON30 that TV programs aimePERSON30 at African [ORGANIZATION]ns feature more fast-fooPERSON30 aPERSON30vertisements than other shows PERSON30o, as well as more commercials for soPERSON30a anPERSON30 canPERSON30y.

Before the rise of fast fooPERSON30 anPERSON30 processePERSON30 fooPERSON30s, many low-income black families grew their own fooPERSON30 anPERSON30 ate lots of grains anPERSON30 beans. In 19DATE475, one stuPERSON30y founPERSON30, poor anPERSON30 miPERSON30PERSON30le-income blacks ate healthier-though often more meager-[PERSON]s than rich whites [PERSON]. But over [PERSON]5, the price of meat, junk fooPERSON30, anPERSON30 simple carbohyPERSON30rates plummetePERSON30, while the price of vegetables rose.

The issue arose after Texan progressive activist [LOCATION]4 argued that PERSON5 should be investigated for sexual assault.106 ORG21 Threatens to [ORGANIZATION] of [LOCATION]5 Again After He Reacts to GPE17 Riots107 ORG21 has removed several posts from pro-[LOCATION]0 comedian [LOCATION]5 and threatened to unpublish his page for the second time in DATE14. One of the videos that ORG21 removed and cited in its threat to unpublish [LOCATION]6 page featured [LOCATION]6 reacting to a viral video clip of a mans feet being set on fire during riots in [LOCATION]. This viral video has been widely shared across social media with many people making fun of the incident or editing the video to make it appear as if the man is dancing to popular songs.108 ORG22 Blue Lives Dont Matter Because They Are Not a Thing109 The left-wing ORG22 reacted to the gunning down of two GPE15 County Sheriffs officers by tweeting that blue lives dont matter because they are not a thing. The two officers were left fighting for their lives after being ambushed and shot at point-blank range through their patrol car window on [TIME] by an African-[ORGANIZATION] gunman.110 How to Steal an Election, Part 2 The [ORGANIZATION] Response111 The very publication of the ORG23 [ORGANIZATION] report and the subsequent news media reporting about it are components of psychological warfare within the broader information warfare campaign aimed at spreading demoralizing rumors to [LOCATION]0 supporters. The goal is to break down and weaken support before, during and after DATE16. Demoralized and unmotivated supporters do not make their support for their candidate public. They do not campaign in neighborhoods or post yard signs. They do not vote. They do not volunteer at polling places. They become convinced their hopes are lost, and highly controversial cause. They do not wish to be called a racist, or a hater, or identified with other fringe elements. They stay at home and watch TV. Having been psychologically conditioned through the [ORGANIZATION] pandemic to withdraw, isolate, and lock-down  on largely fiat orders of various government officials  many [ORGANIZATION]s will react to the irregular and extra-legal tactics of the [ORGANIZATION]ft. The [ORGANIZATION]ft relies on this reaction to suppress voter turnout and use varying forms of terror, such as reprisals and the threats of reprisals, against those who do not cooperate or who challenge the projected accusations detailed in the [ORGANIZATION] report. The [ORGANIZATION] report is careful not to engage in sedition. They are a whisper away from advocating violence  but these are very sharp political operatives that are all lawyered-up, so they speak in code. Here are some examples for you to read between the lines112 ORG24 Celebrate 911 Attacks as Pivotal Moment For ORG25 in First-Ever [ORGANIZATION]8ment on [ORGANIZATION] has celebrated the 911 attacks that killed 2,977 people and injured 25,000 more as a pivotal moment in ORG25ic history. The death cults propaganda arm made the comments as part of a rant on the anniversary of the [ORGANIZATION] ORG26 mass murder attack on GPE19 ORG27 Tight End [LOCATION]7 Wears [LOCATION]8 Name on Back of Helmet115 Jacksonville ORG27 tight end [LOCATION]7 paid tribute to slain police officer [LOCATION]9 during his DATE17 game against ORG29 on [PERSON].

Miraculously, both are expected to survive. The ORG31 reports that both deputies are recovering following surgery after the [ORGANIZATION] NBCs [PERSON] Night Football Ratings Plummet Nearly 30 Compared to DATE19 [PERSON] Night Footballs match up between the [ORGANIZATION]1 Rams and ORG33 saw asignificant drop in TV ratings and viewership when compared to [ORGANIZATION]0 official start of SNF.120 [ORGANIZATION]2 Man Arrested Twice in [TIME] After Starting Multiple Fires Along GPE17 Freeway121 An [ORGANIZATION]2 man was arrested [ORGANIZATION]1 morning for using a Molotov cocktail to ignite a brush fire along a GPE17 freeway, [TIME] after he was released from custody for setting another fire along the same [STREET], according to local police.122 [ORGANIZATION]2 Sheriffs Deputy Investigating Fires Pays Price for Saying Unkind Words About Antifa123 An [ORGANIZATION]2 sheriffs deputy has been put on leave after he called ORG34 rioters motherfckers at the end of an interview with a regular protest videographer who reported ORG34 sightings in the fire zone. The word spread quickly that the [ORGANIZATION]3 deputy, who hasnt been identified, was spreading rumors about the origin of the devastating fires, which have forced the evacuations of hundreds of thousands of [ORGANIZATION]2ians. But did he? And were those reports so far out of line?

GPE11 District Judge PERSON24, a [LOCATION]0 appointee, ruled on [ORGANIZATION]1 in a 66-page opinion that the restrictions were overreaching, arbitrary, and violated citizens constitutional rights. Plaintiffs in the case include hair salons, a farmers market vendor, a horse trainer [STREET]-in movie theaters, and several ORG35 lawmakers, according to ORG36. The ruling means that the current restrictions  including limitations on the size of all gatherings, cannot be enforced.126 President [LOCATION]0 Sending Out 80M Unsolicited Ballots is [ORGANIZATION], Total Fraud127 President [LOCATION]0 has continued to slam mail-in voting as a growing number of states are set to send out ballots. He has warned the process opens up the door for voter fraud. During a campaign rally in [ORGANIZATION]6 [ORGANIZATION]2, he slammed states which are sending out unsolicited ballots and advised voters to confirm their ballot is counted. Make sure you send the ballot in, and then go to your polling [STREET] and make sure it counts, he stated. Make sure it gets in because the only [STREET] they can win is by doing very bad things, thats the only [STREET]. President [LOCATION]0 has previously said he supports absentee voting, where a ballot is sent to voters who request them. However, hes been highly critical of universal mail-in voting, where ballots are sent to voters regardless if they requested them or not.128 Report PERSON25 Plans ORG37 [PERSON] on Marxist [PERSON]7 Founder129 The Duchess of Sussex, actress PERSON25, has reportedly pitched a documentary to ORG37 on the life of the co-founder of the [PERSON]7 movement, after signing a 120 million deal with the [ORGANIZATION] streaming giant according to a British newspaper. The biopic would reportedly tell the story of [PERSON]6 leader PERSON26, who has described herself and her other co-founders as trained [PERSON]. PERSON27 has also admitted to being mentored by [ORGANIZATION], a communist domestic terrorist in [PERSON].130 PERSON29 Blasts [ORGANIZATION]0 for Visiting [ORGANIZATION]1 and Not [ORGANIZATION] in Her Own [ORGANIZATION]8131 Former [ORGANIZATION]8 Gov.

[ORGANIZATION]2 and his wife, who also happens to be an art professor at the same college, observed the protest on [ORGANIZATION]3 in GPE30. When students saw social media posts of them on the sidelines of the protest, they demanded the professor be fired. The college, however, has announced that it will not cater to the whims of the students and decided to ignore calls for the professor to be dismissed. But the president [ORGANIZATION]3 said that they were going to deal with such issues through ongoing community dialogue and that the college is committed to addressing both the subtle and the overt forms of racism that persist in every part of the [ORGANIZATION] project.134 GPE31 Billboard Cautions Drivers to Enter GPE32 At Your Own Risk After City Reduces Police Budget135 [ORGANIZATION] launched a billboard campaign [ORGANIZATION] warning drivers to enter the state capital of GPE32 at your own risk after city officials reduced the [INSTITUTION] budget.136 [ORGANIZATION] in Half of [ORGANIZATION]4 Donations From Untraceable, Unemployed Donors137 A major ORG41 fundraising group called ORG40 has come under intense scrutiny from conservative watchdog groups after an analysis by [ORGANIZATION] found that more than half of the donations coming into the liberal organization came from people claiming to be unemployed.138 [LOCATION]0 Calls for Death Penalty for Cop Attackers139 President [LOCATION]0 called for the Death Penalty for a gunman who carried out a cold blooded attack on two [LOCATION] deputies in GPE15, as sick protesters chanted we hope they die.

The chants began when the President spoke about former ORG45 head PERSON43 allegedly feeding debate questions to PERSON42 [ORGANIZATION]5. As the chants grew, [LOCATION]0 again brought up PERSON44 email scandal.146 [ORGANIZATION] in GPE34 Over an Obviously Justified Police Shooting147 Weve come a long [STREET] since the death of PERSON45. The initial outrage over PERSON46 death in [ORGANIZATION]6 was at least justified, but now, the violent protests rocking city streets are increasingly unmoored from any just cause or actual victim. GPE34, [ORGANIZATION]5, offers the latest grim example of baseless unrest turning violent. More than 100 protesters took to the streets of GPE34 on [PERSON] night after a police shooting once again provoked viral outrage, and it wasnt peaceful. Agitators vandalized the police station, smashed windows, and threw bricks. Vandals also damaged several random private businesses and looted. They also damaged a post office and defaced city streets. Death to cops was spray-painted memorably on one building during the unrest.148 Watch PERSON47  GPE35 Has All the Bases Set for Civil War149 GPE35 has all the bases set for civil war, says author PERSON47. Those radicals seeking to destroy the [PERSON] . from within should be careful what they wish for if they think the Anglo-[ORGANIZATION] hegemony was bad, theyre going to have a hell of a time when they discover what the Chinese hegemony looks like.150 What Happened to PERSON48 Did he sell the [ORGANIZATION] Report? Or did he just sell out?152 [PERSON] to Get Worse Thanks to PERSON49 Policies, Says Fire Expert Who Predicted Uptick in Blazes153 Former President [ORGANIZATION] made a significant change to federal land management [ORGANIZATION]7 that created the conditions necessary for massive wildfires to consume portions of the [ORGANIZATION], according to one fire expert who predicted the problem [ORGANIZATION]8. Shortly before leaving office in [ORGANIZATION], PERSON49 limited the ability of [PERSON] Forest Service to thin out a dense thicket of foliage and downed trees on federal land to bring the LOC2 into a pristine state, PERSON50, an experienced forester with a PhD in environmental science, told ORG47. The former presidents decision created a ticking time bomb, PERSON51 argues. If you dont start managing these forests, then they are going to start burning up. [ORGANIZATION]9, they are still ignoring it, said PERSON51, who spent DATE30 as a reforestation contractor. He was referring to warnings he made [ORGANIZATION]8, telling officials that warding off prescribed burns in [ORGANIZATION]2 and GPE37 creates kindling fuelling fires.154 Yet Another Poll Oversamples Democrats as [PERSON] to [ORGANIZATION]arn From DATE31 As weve noted numerous times over DATE32, a trick commonly employed by pollsters to achieve a desired outcome is oversampling  including more Democrats and left-leaning independents than Republicans and right-leaning independents in surveys in order to make it appear as though a candidate is doing better than they actually are.156 ORG48 [ORGANIZATION] ORG49 [ORGANIZATION] Professor [PERSON] for Contradicting [ORGANIZATION]4157 The latest instance of coronavirus-related censorship taking [STREET] on ORG48 is shedding light on the giant as not only vigorously suppressing opposing voices, but also opposing science. At the same time, [ORGANIZATION] decision to remove a video uploaded in DATE33 of an interview with Professor [PERSON], a senior fellow at [ORGANIZATION]1, and advisor to The ORG49, is shrouded in mystery. The justification given by the video giant is that [PERSON] failed to properly align his views with that of [ORGANIZATION]3 [ORGANIZATION]4 or local health authorities.158 Coronavirus Why You Are Now in Great Danger159 by [PERSON] DSc FRSA DATE34, it is clear that the cure, not the problem, is causing the crisis. Right at the beginning of the coronavirus affair I pointed out that according to [ORGANIZATION]5, the ordinary flu kills between 250,000 and 600,000 people [PERSON]3  most of them in DATE35. I said that if the coronavirus hadnt killed between 100,000 and 150,000 people around the world by DATE36 then it would be clear that it was not as dangerous as we had been told and, indeed, not as dangerous as the flu. Well, the authorities are claiming that the death rate from the corona has now reached 100,000. So is the coronavirus as deadly as the mathematicians and the politicians said it was? No  because they have fiddled the figures. DATE34, anyone who has the coronavirus, or is thought to have it even though they have not been tested, will be put down as having died of the coronavirus. Time and time again, the authorities report that someone died with the disease. Not of the disease. And yet those patients are put down as having died as a result of the coronavirus. So, if you fall downstairs and break your neck, but you had a cough before you died, then you will be classified as a coronavirus death. If you had a heart attack but were thought to have the coronavirus then you officially died of the coronavirus rather than the heart attack. A lack of widespread testing makes this possible. And post mortems have been abandoned for many patients. [PERSON] Up 25 Per Cent in the GPE38 Following [PERSON] Virus [LOCATION]s161 Family law firms are predicting a post-lockdown divorce boom, as a report from a leading charity has claimed that the Chinese coronavirus and the ensuing lockdowns have caused enormous strain on relationships. [ORGANIZATION]6 has disclosed that after an initial dip during the early stages of the [ORGANIZATION] lockdown in [LOCATION], searches for divorce guidance has risen by 25 per cent in DATE38 over the same period in [ORGANIZATION]4.162 Famous Polish Girl in Tragic WWII Photo That Shocked the World Has Passed Away163 PERSON55, the heroine of a moving photograph which documented German war crimes during their invasion of GPE40 in [PERSON]0, died in [PERSON]1. She was [PERSON]2. The photograph which was seen by millions around the world was taken by [ORGANIZATION] journalist PERSON56 on [DATE], [PERSON]0, and it depicts PERSON55, then a [PERSON]4 girl, kneeling over her fallen sister PERSON57. She had been killed in GPE41 by gunfire from a German fighter plane. The young [PERSON]5 who died had gone into a field to pick potatoes. She was shot by a [ORGANIZATION]7 pilot in what was a gratuitous attack on civilians who were of no threat to the aircraft.164 French Philosopher PERSON58 We Know Where the Savagery Comes From But the Media Covers it Up165 While referring to [PERSON] large migrant population, French philosopher and journalist PERSON58 said that even though the country is aware who is committing assaults and violent crimes, the media refuses to report on it. PERSON59 made his remarks as a part of a guest panel for the [ORGANIZATION]8 television program, in which he discussed the influx of migrants to [ORGANIZATION] and a corresponding increase in crime. PERSON59, an Algerian-born French [PERSON] who works as a columnist for one of [PERSON] top newspaper, [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]0, mainly pointed out that mainstream media ignores the stories of French citizens when they become the victims of migrant crimes, while the government would in many cases take the migrants side and the victims would become prosecuted by the authorities.166 [ORGANIZATION]9 to Add New Warships  For Financial Purposes167 by [PERSON]1 [PERSON] is in the process of obtaining five new warships. However, the purchase, despite [PERSON]6s latest aspirations, is not intended to initiate a paradigm shift within the ORG61 but is instead about German efficiency  unfortunately. The Currently [PERSON] of [PERSON]6s Military [PERSON]6s armed forces are currently in a sorry state. Foreign missions that would require combat operations are out of the question. The troops reputation in their own country is practically non-existent, and allies know that German soldiers can, at best, be utilized for basic and routine services abroad. For the first time [PERSON]6, the countrys leaders opened a serious discussion making the ORG61 fit to face the new challenges in the world, but the majority of the population still does not support the idea, and thus the grand coalition remains divided over the forces future. 168 [LOCATION]s Election Day A Preview169 [LOCATION] will hold a series of elections and a constitutional referendum on [PERSON]7. [PERSON]2 previews the votes and highlights some of the key things to watch out for when the results come through. On [PERSON]7, Italians will head to the polls to vote for the presidency of seven regions, the mayoralty of over 1,100 municipalities, two ORG62 by-elections, and a constitutional referendum over the reduction of the number of MPs. The ballot, held over [PERSON]8, comes as the first democratic test for the government following the [LOCATION]0-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdown, which disrupted plans to hold some of these elections [PERSON]9. The massive DATE16 has already given authorities headaches in terms of ensuring the safety of the procedures, as well as drawing criticism for using school facilities as polling places, cutting short what for many pupils will be DATE51 back in the classroom since DATE5. The constitutional referendum is the only vote on which all the country will have a say. The proposal to reduce the number of MPs in ORG63 from 630 to 400 and Senators from 315 to 200 is widely expected to pass, though with a low turnout and with little enthusiasm. The measure, sponsored by the largest government party, ORG64, has no real opponents outside of a few very vocal [ORGANIZATION] accounts parties of the right have expressed lukewarm support for it, while the centre-left junior coalition partner, [ORGANIZATION], has remained neutral. The latest ORG66 poll, published on DATE52 on ORG67 has Yes at [DATE], with a turnout estimate of 52. Conversely, the national conversation has so far focused intensely on the regional elections in GPE43, [ORGANIZATION], GPE48 and GPE49. These votes are a big deal regions have extensive powers on key policy areas like healthcare, infrastructure, agriculture and education, and the seven that will vote make up more than a third of [LOCATION]s population. Moreover, regional presidents have been some of the most visible policy-makers during the coronavirus crisis, and it is expected that their performance will weigh heavily on voters decisions alongside judgements of the national response. Figure 1 Current polling for the upcoming regional elections Note Compiled by the author. But ultimately regional elections always have a strong national political significance. The electoral system, which returns a clear winner with a guaranteed majority, encourages voters and commentators to think of regional contests in party political terms, as high-stakes horse races. In short, voters cast two ballots one for a coalition of parties supporting a candidate for the presidency and one for an individual party. The highest-polling coalition gets the presidency, 80 of seats in the regional council are attributed proportionally according to party votes, plus a 20 top-up that ensures that the winning coalition holds a majority in the council. If regional elections are a thermometer of national party standings, [LOCATION] is in the grip of a right-wing fever. Since the last general election, the coalition of the right  headed by radical right parties [ORGANIZATION] of [LOCATION] FdI, plus [PERSON]3  snatched the presidency from [LOCATION] in eight out of nine regional races, with the ORG[DATE] trailing the two main coalitions by miles in virtually every election and plummeting into single-digits in [DATE]. Figure 2 Presidential coalitions in Italian regions Note Compiled by the author. Although regional election polls in [LOCATION] are notoriously unreliable, this time around the left can be reasonably confident of holding onto the presidency of GPE43. The southern region is not historically their home turf, but here the [LOCATION] can count on an unlikely saviour incumbent regional president [PERSON]4. A colourful character with a dozen [STREET] cases to his name and ostensibly a relic of the reviled partitocrazia of old  he became secretary of [PERSON]0 provinces [ORGANIZATION] chapter in DATE53  [PERSON]5 is wildly popular in his home region. Much of [PERSON]5s appeal is due to his sheriff-like handling of the response to the coronavirus, which saw footage of him threatening to send police to stop unauthorised gatherings with flamethrowers go viral on social media. Yet his unconventional style seems to have worked [PERSON]1 province has 3 million people and is one of the most high-density areas in [ORGANIZATION], but it only registered 4,000 [LOCATION]0-19 cases. And the polls are clear that the meme president is comfortably leading his main rival, former regional president [PERSON]7, by over 20 points [PERSON]8, DATE54. GPE43 President [PERSON]5, armed with a flamethrower, features as the main character in an arcade-style online game where he incinerates university graduates wishing to celebrate unauthorised and potentially infectious graduation parties. Holding onto the presidency of DATE5e is poised to be a much harder task for the lefts coalition. Though sometimes considered part of [LOCATION] in Central [LOCATION], DATE5e is one of the regions where [ORGANIZATION] has made the most inroads since it expanded its appeal beyond the LOC8, and was the epicentre of anti-migrant violence in the run-up to the [ORGANIZATION] election. The [LOCATION] incumbent is stepping down, and the right is supporting a [LOCATION] of [LOCATION] candidate, [PERSON]co [ORGANIZATION]0. The polls have [ORGANIZATION]0 ahead by somewhere between eight [ORGANIZATION], 25 DATE33 and fifteen percentage points [PERSON]8, 25-DATE54. All in all, the race seems to be a re-run of the rights triumph of DATE58 in [PERSON]2 a mid-income former left-wing heartland peppered with small towns, politically and demographically very similar to DATE5e. [ORGANIZATION]1 and [ORGANIZATION]2 new right has been more successful than its [ORGANIZATION]3-led predecessor in winning over areas like these  often building, as argued in a recent working paper by [ORGANIZATION]4 and [ORGANIZATION]5, on a pre-existing far-right minority political culture in [LOCATION]. Figure 3 Change in support for [ORGANIZATION] in Italian regions Note Compiled by the author. The presidency of [PERSON]3, however, would be the rights most highly prized target wealthier, more urban and more left-leaning than DATE5e, former PM [ORGANIZATION]6 home region has been ruled by left-wing administrations for DATE59 of its existence. But this time, [ORGANIZATION]s candidate, [ORGANIZATION]7, has a genuine shot at breaking the streak. Earlier [ORGANIZATION], polls had the lefts candidate and current speaker of the regional council, [ORGANIZATION]8, leading [ORGANIZATION]9 by three to six points, but a poll published by [PERSON]8 on [ORGANIZATION]1 had the gap down to just half a percentage point. The possibility of a run-off  [PERSON]3s twist on regional election rules requires a second round if no coalition reaches 40 of the vote  seems unlikely at this point, as the left and right have largely squeezed the ORG[DATE]s vote. It is hard to overstate how shocking it would be for [PERSON]3 to fall to the right, and even a narrow victory for the left shouldnt be of much comfort to the [LOCATION] and its allies. However, the precedent of [PERSON]4, another core LOC9 region that had its election in [ORGANIZATION]2, suggests caution there, some polls even had the right slightly ahead, but the left won by seven points on DATE16. A similar result in neighbouring [PERSON]3, with PERSON80 and the left eking it out in the end, is still the most likely outcome. Alongside [PERSON]3, the other close regional election is in GPE46, where incumbent PERSON81 faces [ORGANIZATION] PERSON82, freshly acquitted of corruption charges related to his tenure as president of GPE46 [ORGANIZATION]3. In this case, the left has been working pretty hard at self-sabotage. [ORGANIZATION], a former member of the [LOCATION] now running as an independent, has alienated the centrist components of the lefts coalition ORG76 and liberal ORG77, who are running their own candidate against him. At the same time, while [ORGANIZATION] is close to the ORG[DATE] on many issues  his opposition to the [ORGANIZATION] pipeline, his support for judicial activism and crucially his burning hatred of PERSON84  attempts to form a joint list with the ORG[DATE] fell through. The latest opinion polls have [ORGANIZATION] trailing [ORGANIZATION] by one [PERSON]8, [ORGANIZATION]4 to six points ORG79, [ORGANIZATION]5, though [ORGANIZATION] came slightly ahead of his rival in other polls earlier [ORGANIZATION]. In sum, the race is wide open. Much will be determined by the decisions of ORG[DATE] voters ORG[DATE] candidate PERSON86 is still projected to win around 15 of the vote, but the left will be aiming to capture some of that vote as it becomes clearer PERSON87 doesnt have a real shot to the presidency. Only in [LOCATION], the slender strip of land that stretches across the northwestern shore of [LOCATION], have the [LOCATION] and ORG[DATE] agreed to run a joint candidate, after ORG[DATE] members gave their seal of approval to pre-electoral alliances in an online vote. The alliance, however, is unlikely to make a difference [LOCATION] seems safely in the bag for the right. Incumbent president PERSON88, a close ally of [ORGANIZATION]3 who had at one point been anointed as his presumptive political heir, is polling at 60 [PERSON]8, [ORGANIZATION]7, 25 points ahead of PERSON89, the joint [LOCATION]-ORG[DATE] candidate. An even more lopsided victory for the right is to be expected in GPE49. Not only is the wealthy LOC8-Eastern region a traditional reservoir of votes for [ORGANIZATION], but the incumbent president Luca [PERSON]2 [ORGANIZATION] is the most popular regional administrator in the country, even ahead of [PERSON]5 and his flamethrowers. Again, performance during the coronavirus outbreak seems to have been decisive [PERSON]1 early and extensive testing initiatives have been widely credited with stopping a Lombardy-like outbreak in its tracks. [PERSON]2, the most prominent of [ORGANIZATION]s old guard of northern autonomists who are queasy about [PERSON]3 turn to Italian nationalism, is projected to win over 70 of the vote in GPE49 [PERSON]8, [ORGANIZATION]8, with some even suggesting a record-breaking 80 ORG81, [ORGANIZATION]9. The real question here is just how much political capital [PERSON]2 has  and, in the medium-to-long term, how he wants to use it in the eventuality that [PERSON]3 leadership of [ORGANIZATION] starts to flounder. Figure 4 National polling [DATE] [ORGANIZATION]4 to [DATE] DATE12 Note Compiled by the author. Tiny [PERSON]5 is something of a standalone case the French-speaking region has its own party system dominated by regionalist parties and its own proportional electoral rules, which do not entail direct election of the regional president. The election wasnt even supposed to happen [PERSON]1. After the last vote in [ORGANIZATION], a [ORGANIZATION] president was elected the first one from a national party rather than a regionalist one in [PERSON]2. But the administration collapsed within [PERSON]3, and the regionalists formed a caretaker administration in [ORGANIZATION]4. In the meantime, the region was rocked by a corruption scandal over links between politics and the Calabrian mafia attentive readers might have spotted that this is something of a theme in Italian regional politics. We dont have any poll to go by, and GPE48s regional politics is very idiosyncratic, so theres little to be said about it with certainty. [ORGANIZATION] has been on its [STREET] up there, while the regionalists have been affected the most by the mafia scandals, so a strong performance by the right is to be expected. At the same time, the [LOCATION] will be looking to get back into the regional council, as the party did not clear the threshold in the [ORGANIZATION] election. The regional presidency will be a matter of jockeying in the council, so it may not be known for some time after the election. What to look out for on [TIME] Its easy to get lost in the fractured landscape of Italian regional politics. So heres a quick round-up of what to keep an eye on when the results come through to help you bluff your [STREET] through [TIME] a.. The winning coalition in GPE46 and [PERSON]3. Assuming that the right has three regions in the bag GPE49, [ORGANIZATION] and the left has one GPE43, a few votes in the two closest elections can make the difference between a final tally of 3-3 narrative the [LOCATION] is alive and kicking and a thumping 5-1 win for the right narrative landslide for [PERSON]4, government in disarray. b.. The performance of the ORG[DATE]-[LOCATION] alliance in [LOCATION]. The parties are shackled in an uneasy coalition at national level, but they must be aware by now that they must come to some sort of arrangement if they wish to stem the right-wing tide. If the ORG[DATE]-[LOCATION] joint list in [LOCATION] flops as it did in [PERSON]2 [PERSON]6, will prospects of a full-fledged alliance recede for the foreseeable future? c.. The overall performance of the ORG[DATE]. The party has underperformed badly at local level, squeezed by the left and the right alike, and its now polling around the 10 mark in most regional races. Can Prime Minister [PERSON]5 uptick in popularity help ORG[DATE] candidates, or has support for the ORG[DATE] become essentially a personal vote for [PERSON]6? d.. The size of [PERSON]1 victory in GPE49. How much political capital does [PERSON]2 have, and how will he decide to wield it? e.. The balance of power within the [ORGANIZATION] coalition. The individual party vote tally will also allow us to take stock of one of the most significant and underappreciated trends of the [PERSON]6 the ascent of [LOCATION] of [LOCATION] at the expense of [ORGANIZATION]. To what extent is [PERSON]7 a serious threat to [PERSON]3 leadership of [ORGANIZATION] of [PERSON]6 Pro-Family Policies [PERSON]8 Promoted to Ministerial Position1[DATE] A key architect in [PERSON]6 attempt to increase its countrys birth rate, Hungarian [ORGANIZATION]8 Secretary for [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]8, has been promoted to the rank of minister without portfolio, Prime Minister [PERSON]9 said on DATE8 in an interview with national television channel ORG85.

He called PERSON5 injuries catastrophic. Cops broke a [ORGANIZATION] mans spine virtually into two, he was killed.[ORGANIZATION] police chief [PERSON] ought to consider what police killing is the next time [ORGANIZATION] opens his mouth.Asks PERSON8 In this time of heightened concern around the policing, a more essential question might be, Were we justified in sending them? At some point, Americans decided that the best answer to every social ill lay in the power of the criminal-justice system. Vexing social problems homelessness, drug use, the inability to support ones children, mental illness are presently solved by sending in men and women who specialize in inspiring fear and ensuring compliance. Fear and compliance have their [STREET], but it cant be every [STREET].I would not look to police for answers. As an institution, police tend to be anti-intellectual, careerist and authoritarian in their psychology. And duplicitous and tribal.This is because police departments are self-selecting, attracting someone capable and inclined to kill people. This does NOT appear be lost on the folks who knew PERSON9.Unfortunately, for [ORGANIZATION] this fact does escape the police chief branding himself as reformist, now openly attacking a protesting community objecting to the police killing [PERSON]0.  1  2 page1  3"

In [ORGANIZATION], Sen. [PERSON], [PERSON], toured West [ORGANIZATION] as a presidential candidate in the company of African-American leaders and residents. The [ORGANIZATION] ORG2 reported this statement by PERSON4 Anyone who took the walk that we took around this neighborhood would not think youre in a wealthy nation.

Is it racist to point that out, or is it only racist when a white politician says it? Instead of listening to politicians talk about [ORGANIZATION], elected officials and the media should be talking to people who have been trapped in these squalid areas. They might ask Democrats who have run the city and other cities such as [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], and GPE6, GPE7 where homelessness, crime and filth abound why they have done nothing to improve these neighborhoods. Many American cities with similar problems have been run by Democrats for [PERSON]. Why do voters keep returning them to office when their misery only deepens? What would Democrats do if the poor and minority voters, who are their base, tried a different party and a different attitude? Democrats have promised much and delivered little to their base, at least since [PERSON] when the federal government began to dispense welfare benefits, benefits that have fueled an addiction to entitlement programs and created an allegiance to the party most dedicated to keeping the checks coming in exchange for votes. Democrats such as [PERSON] have also opposed school choice. The ability to choose a better public, or [INSTITUTION] for poor and minority children with vouchers to pay for them is an opportunity to improve their prospects and break out of the poverty cycle that for some families has been repeated for [ORGANIZATION].

This text differs in minor ways from the [PERSON]22 version.ltnlgt According to the most recent poll, the innocuously-named but ferociously anti-establishment [PERSON]8 Democrats [PERSON]24 or [PERSON]25 has the largest support of any political party in [PERSON]8. This news has potentially momentous implications not just for [PERSON]8 but for all [ORGANIZATION].ltnlgt [PERSON]8 is a special [STREET]. One of the richest and most peaceful countries in the world it has not been engaged in armed conflict for [LOCATION]05, until recently it was a remarkably homogenous society where socialism, with its optimistic assumption that people are born good and circumstances make them bad, worked and the government enjoyed great prestige. Swedish pride in the countrys accomplishments translates into an ethical superiority symbolized by the oft-heard claim to be a moral superpower.ltnlgt This heritage has also inspired an intolerance of dissent, however Be quiet, follow the consensus, let the bureaucrats carry it out. The country has become so notorious for its stifling faux-unanimity that I actually heard a Dane recently ask at a public forum, Why has [PERSON]8 turned into [PERSON]32 of [LOCATION]9?ltnlgt Also, [PERSON]8s history creates a no-crisis mentality that militates against the hard-headed, flexible responses needed to cope with current problems the country now faces, especially those connected to waves of mainly Muslim immigrants. As one interlocutor put it to me in [PERSON]33 earlier DATE87, Past success has led to current failure. For example, security in [PERSON]8 is well below what might find in a country like [PERSON]34, with few inclinations to make improvements, rendering ORG94ist violence all but inevitable.ltnlgt In this stultification, the [PERSON]25 stands out because it offers the only political alternative. Proof of this came in [LOCATION]15 [LOCATION]0, when the [PERSON]25 appeared to have the swing vote in a crucial budget vote between the left and right blocs in the countrys unicameral legislature, the [PERSON]26  until all the other seven parties joined together in a grand coalition to deny it any influence.ltnlgt As this act of desperation suggests, the [PERSON]8 Democrats offer a populist  and not, as usually described, a far right  brew of policies anathema to all the legacy parties [PERSON]28, it calls for assimilating legal immigrants, expelling the illegals, and reducing future immigration by at least 90 percent. It also forwards a number of other policies concerning crime, defense, the [ORGANIZATION]an Union, and [PERSON]26 far outside the Swedish consensus and utterly obnoxious to the other parties.ltnlgt With good reason, the establishment hates and fears the [PERSON]25, pedantically finding any possible fault with the party, starting with its alleged neo-fascist past though fascist connections are not unique to [PERSON]25 and going on to the tiniest foibles of its leadership.ltnlgt Supporting the [PERSON]25 remains taboo. The national police commissioner once tweeted about vomiting on seeing the [PERSON]25s leader naturally, his staff dare not acknowledge their supporting for the party. But one officer estimated for me that 50 percent of the police vote [PERSON]25.ltnlgt Despite being ostracized, the [PERSON]25 increasingly connects with Swedes including some immigrants, giving it substantial electoral gains, roughly doubling its parliamentary vote every [LOCATION]0 from 0.4 percent in [LOCATION]09 to 1.3 percent in [LOCATION]10, 2.9 percent in [LOCATION]11, 5.7 percent in [LOCATION]9, and 12.9 percent in September [LOCATION]0. And now, [LOCATION]13, a [PERSON]30 poll shows it having nearly doubled again, to 25.2 percent, meaning that it leads the governing Social Democrats who have only 23.4 percent support and the major nominally right-wing party, the Moderates with 21 percent.ltnlgt No less important, I learned in [PERSON]33, the intellectual and political climate has shifted. Journalists, policy specialists, and politicians all noted that ideas outside the mainstream [LOCATION]14 now receive a hearing. For example, four major newspapers have questioned the consensus in favor of high immigration. Beside the surging [PERSON]25 vote, this shift results from several factors the shocking rise of the ORG94ic [PERSON]8 in [PERSON]8 and [PERSON]9 ORG64, which has altered the debate continued upset at the [LOCATION]15 compact that excluded the [PERSON]25 from having its due parliamentary influence and the receding memory of [ORGANIZATION]53 murderous rampage in Norway.ltnlgt In all, it appears that denial and censorship can only continue for so long before the instinct of self-preservation kicks in. The Western country most prone to national suicide is possibly waking up from its stupor. If this change can take [STREET] in [PERSON]8, [PERSON]32 of [LOCATION]9, it can, and likely will, occur elsewhere in [ORGANIZATION].ltnlgt This text may be reposted or forwarded so long as it is presented as an integral whole with complete and accurate information provided about its author, date, [STREET] of publication, and original URL.ltnlgtltnlgt The Wave Has Reached Us ORG[ORGANIZATION]1 Gropes for Answers to Migrant Surge[PERSON]4ltnlgt A surge in migrants, many of them refugees from [PERSON]9, hit [PERSON]16s southern border on [DATE]4, passing through gaps in an unfinished barrier to a [ORGANIZATION] groping for answers to its worst refugee crisis since World War Two.ltnlgt Nearing the end of a flight from war and poverty, they walked around or over coils of barbed wire strung out along [PERSON]16s [PERSON]5-km 109-mile frontier with [LOCATION]6, children hoisted on shoulders, bags in hand.ltnlgt The wave has definitely reached us now, said [ORGANIZATION]54, head of a migration NGO called [PERSON]31.

baltimore,2016-08-21T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,The Baltimore Sun,affordable housing,PART 2: Working in [ORGANIZATION]: Its Downtown and Business Parks Went Up and Down With The Economy,"Baseball cap says [ORGANIZATION] Celebrates [ORGANIZATION]. Photo by [PERSON] The baseball caps handed out [ORGANIZATION] said [ORGANIZATION] Celebrates [ORGANIZATION], and on the back there was the cryptic embroidery 5K125M. It meant 5,000 homes, a [ORGANIZATION]7 of [ORGANIZATION] single family and townhouses, and 125 million in land sales. While the two companies were described as partners, the relationship was really that of buyer and seller. Using the raw land it purchased in [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION] sold developed lots to [ORGANIZATION], and [ORGANIZATION] then built houses on the lots to sell to homebuyers -- and did it quickly and cheaply. Not too many companies have these kinds of relationships, said [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] chairman, president and CEO. PERSON4 Land The relationship illustrates a key financial aspect of the entire [ORGANIZATION] project [PERSON] undeveloped farmland at low prices, improve it with streets, water, sewer, shops and amenities, and sell it for many times its original cost. [PERSON] low sell high. At the celebration, there was some gentle ribbing on both sides about the most constant source of friction in the relationship the price of land. We dont charge as much for the lots as we should, joked a [ORGANIZATION] executive. In [DATE], the first nine lots [ORGANIZATION] bought from [ORGANIZATION] cost 45,900 or 5,100 apiece. [ORGANIZATION], residential lots were going for 20 times that amount or more. This building at FAC0 parkways once was the [ORGANIZATION] head[ORGANIZATION]7s. Now it houses [LOCATION] that James [ORGANIZATION] set up to support affordable housing projects. Photo by [PERSON] Yet among the ironies of the [PERSON] event was that [ORGANIZATION], now a publicly traded company, had abandoned its attractive head[ORGANIZATION]7s in downtown [ORGANIZATION] DATE5 and hustled off to [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] home state. The departure from the planned community where the homebuilding giant grew up had disappointed [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] officials, but no one brought it up at a celebration geared toward happy recollections. By that time, the [ORGANIZATION] Co. was about done selling building lots to single-family homebuilders. Not far from the GPE2 ballroom was the last of a dozen model home parks, where [ORGANIZATION] and other builders, some of them home-grown but smaller, had displayed their wares. [ORGANIZATION] after the celebration, [ORGANIZATION] itself would disappear from downtown [ORGANIZATION] in a 12 billion sale to [ORGANIZATION], one of the biggest GPE3 real estate deals ever recorded. The two companies that created [ORGANIZATION] were among the dozens of companies that have come and gone over [PERSON]. But unlike the tech companies that have merged or evaporated, [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] left behind permanent structures in which people live and work, like the DATE8 [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] model in which this essay is being written. During their time, the two publicly traded companies were a visible corporate presence in [ORGANIZATION], with executives and their spouses serving on nonprofit and community boards. The companies were generous financial supporters of community causes. [PERSON] and [PERSON] While Jim [ORGANIZATION] preached his grand social vision of a garden for growing people, those people needed shelter and jobs, shops and services -- and the businesses that provided them. Those homes and workplaces were essential to the economic model that would make [ORGANIZATION] a viable enterprise. As noted in DATE9 essay1, before [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] was largely a farming community with minimal employment outside of agriculture and retail. The smattering of residents in suburban developments mostly commuted into [PERSON], still a city of 900,000 people, 50 larger than it is [LOCATION]0. There were only two major employment centers in the county -- [ORGANIZATION], a center for defense work where, much like [LOCATION]0, few people knew what they did and the [ORGANIZATION] corridor. [LOCATION]1, and still [LOCATION]0, ORG9 is the largest private employer in [ORGANIZATION], now with 5,000 employees, working mostly on federal research projects. Until FAC2 between the GPE5 and [PERSON] beltways was fully completed in [LOCATION]2, [ORGANIZATION] was the major north-south route on [ORGANIZATION], and already looking seedy. Warehouses, junkyards and industrial operations were concentrated there, and just east were the freight railroad tracks that serve as the border between [ORGANIZATION] and the neighboring GPE7, from which it was lopped off in [LOCATION]3. Aside from [ORGANIZATION] shopping centers -- more on those [LOCATION]4 -- the principal employment centers were to be in downtown [ORGANIZATION] and east of [PERSON], ringing the edges of the new towns residential growth. With few people living there and the highways unfinished, [ORGANIZATION] itself built the first office buildings on the farmland that became downtown. It built a hotel there as well, before there was a market to support one, the low-slung ORG10. The hotel later added the current tower, becoming the [ORGANIZATION] Inn, and then in [LOCATION]5, [ORGANIZATION] finally unloaded the property to become the ORG12 it still is [LOCATION]0. The company slowly added seven more office buildings over [LOCATION]6, but it saved the choicest spots until the population rose and increased the value of the land. [PERSON] For the east side of [ORGANIZATION], the company followed the pattern of developing business sites for others to build on. The first business to build there was ORG13, which at the time did environmental studies, later branching into medical and nuclear equipment. PERSON8 chose [ORGANIZATION] because of its central location and because of a promised lifestyle that would make it easy to recruit highly educated workers. It was more of a dream [STREET] at that time, PERSON9 told the [PERSON] Sun in a [LOCATION]7 interview. But the promise for me was that this was a [STREET] that would attract and hold scientists and engineers. PERSON9 would become the first chair of the new [ORGANIZATION] ORG15. It was a refrain that would echo through the [LOCATION]6 from firms large and small about the decision to locate in [ORGANIZATION]. The first reason related to the time-honored real estate mantra of location, location, location, the central location that led [ORGANIZATION] to scarf up 14,000 acres of farmland. The second reason was the educated workforce, including a concentration of scientists and engineers. For [LOCATION]6, [ORGANIZATION] had more cachet than [ORGANIZATION] as a business address, said [PERSON]0, the countys economic development director from [LOCATION]9. He recounted the tale of a developer who wanted his new office buildings to have a [ORGANIZATION] address, despite its GPE8 zip code. Go ahead and call it [ORGANIZATION] anyway, [PERSON]1 told him. A postal inspector told them to knock it off. ORG16 Then Out This aerial photo shows the existing water tower and [PERSON] on the left, FAC5 on the upper right, [ORGANIZATION] intersection with [ORGANIZATION] at the bottom, and ORG17 buildings in the middle. Photo for [ORGANIZATION] by [PERSON]2 [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION] Archives. PERSON9s modest industrial building was small potatoes compared to the major sale for the biggest parcel on the east side of [ORGANIZATION] to one of the worlds largest corporations, [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] sold 1,125 acres south of [ORGANIZATION]75 between [PERSON] and FAC5 for what was to become [ORGANIZATION]. It was projected to employ more than 10,000 people, manufacturing and distributing appliances, similar to an existing appliance park in [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION]0. Imagine how different the [ORGANIZATION] economy would be [LOCATION]0 if manufacturing had been its core industry. Ultimately, ORG21 only built four mammoth buildings on a third of the site, and employment topped at 2,800 in [DATE]0, when the company closed the air conditioner plant. [DATE]1, it shuttered the microwave oven plant as it began importing machines from [ORGANIZATION]1 and [ORGANIZATION]2. It finally shut the range plant in [DATE]2 as it acquired a more productive [ORGANIZATION]3 facility. The saga illustrates the vagaries of the economy and the fluctuating dynamics of individual industries that were constantly challenging the profitability of the [ORGANIZATION] project. From the time [ORGANIZATION] started acquiring land in [DATE]3, there have been seven national recessions. The most devastating for [ORGANIZATION]s [ORGANIZATION] project was the DATE8-75 downturn that combined the Arab oil embargo, high inflation and high unemployment. Land sales plummeted and [ORGANIZATION] Research and Development [ORGANIZATION] -- the [ORGANIZATION] Co. division that was building [ORGANIZATION] -- would have gone bankrupt except for an infusion of cash from ORG25, original financier of [ORGANIZATION]s entire [ORGANIZATION] project. [ORGANIZATION] bought back the two-thirds of the land that ORG21 never used, and later, as ORG21 pulled out, some of those buildings, as well. In the long run, while the 10,000 well-paid ORG21 manufacturing and office workers never materialized, [ORGANIZATION] used the land to create [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]0, which eventually would include one of the largest concentrations of high tech businesses in the [PERSON]-GPE5 corridor. By [DATE]5, [ORGANIZATION]0 would become a hot location, but it was a long time coming, [DATE]6 after ORG21s initial deal. [ORGANIZATION] As difficult as the [DATE]7 recession had been for [ORGANIZATION]s project, the [DATE]2s recession was more severe for the [ORGANIZATION]4 economy because of the cutbacks in defense spending from the collapse of [ORGANIZATION]5 ending the Cold War. As the commercial real estate market struggled to overcome this, as well as digest speculative overbuilding from [DATE]9, [ORGANIZATION] sold only one measly acre of land in [ORGANIZATION]0 -- for a parking lot. I aggressively sat by the phone, waiting for it to ring, recalled [PERSON]3, [ORGANIZATION] vice president for business land sales. The situation in [ORGANIZATION]0 was so dire that an empty glass-and-marble five-story office building was sold to the county government at a fire-sale price, becoming head[ORGANIZATION]7s for several agencies, including the newly privatized [ORGANIZATION]0. Then along came [ORGANIZATION]1. The fast-growing company, founded by a graduate of [ORGANIZATION] High School, supplied hardware and software to restaurants and hotels worldwide. Its 700 employees were scattered among several buildings in [ORGANIZATION]6. A few top executives already lived in [ORGANIZATION], and we felt relocating there could help our technical recruiting efforts, its chief financial officer told me. In [DATE]5, it put up the first [ORGANIZATION]0 office building visible from FAC5. For a brief time from [DATE]5 to [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION]0 and other [ORGANIZATION] locations were the epicenter of an explosion of fiber optics research, with [ORGANIZATION]3 the biggest player, employing 1,500 people at one point and raising 1 billion in its initial stock offering. Companies large and small were trying to capture a share of the photonics revolution, boosting communications and Internet speeds through fiber optic cables. The movement was so large that we at [ORGANIZATION]4 produced a special section for a national engineering conference in [PERSON] on fiber optics in [PERSON], featuring all two-dozen [ORGANIZATION]4 companies. Those that survived the end of the boomlet transformed themselves by merger or acquisition. Some simply went out of business. The [ORGANIZATION]1 sign that graced its building for [ORGANIZATION]1 has been replaced by its new owner, [ORGANIZATION]5, repeating the continual pattern where large high tech firms eat small tech firms. There are few large head[ORGANIZATION]7s of home-grown businesses anymore. [ORGANIZATION]6, the hospital conglomerate that has agreed to occupy the newest downtown [ORGANIZATION] structure going up at FAC0, is an exception. Not only is the [ORGANIZATION]1 sign gone, so is [ORGANIZATION]7, the once-thousand-strong audience monitoring firm for radio stations on [ORGANIZATION]2 Parkway at [ORGANIZATION]4. It was purchased by [ORGANIZATION]8, which now has a smaller presence here. The [ORGANIZATION]9 building on Little [ORGANIZATION]1 Parkway across from the community college, once the head[ORGANIZATION]7s for a 13-paper chain of community newspapers, has stood vacant for [ORGANIZATION]2 and is slated for affordable housing. Long-time community leaders note the loss in corporate presence here. The business community used to be very much involved in social issues here ... as corporate citizens, observed [PERSON]4, president of the [ORGANIZATION] Association for 26 [ORGANIZATION]2. Now, there are a lot of corporate addresses and absentee ownership, noted [PERSON]5, head of [LOCATION]1, an advertising and marketing firm. Not Like [ORGANIZATION] Whats even odder about this long run-down of the business underpinnings of [ORGANIZATION] and its role as a key employment center for the region is that [ORGANIZATION]0 may officially be part of [ORGANIZATION], but by look and feel it and the other local business parks could be anywhere. Their landlords and tenants generate millions for the [ORGANIZATION] Association lien, but theres little sense that they are part of [ORGANIZATION] at all. The majority of employees in [ORGANIZATION]0, or any [ORGANIZATION] business park, do not live in [ORGANIZATION], much as the majority of [ORGANIZATION] residents do not work in the new town, as was the case from [ORGANIZATION]3. Only one out of five working [ORGANIZATION] residents has commuting times of [TIME] or less, and close to half 45 have commuting times of [TIME] or more. Living and working here, as I have been able to do for half my career, might have been the ideal, but it has never been true for the vast majority of residents. lives in [ORGANIZATION]0, except for one long-term-stay hotel. There is no mixed use, and but a puny strip of retail. Larger office buildings have their own cafeterias, or at least delis. Even with 12,000 or more people working there, pedestrian traffic is nil. Even [ORGANIZATION]0s [STREET] names have none of the striking weirdness of [ORGANIZATION] residential cul-de-sacs, drawn from American literature. Instead, they are named for American inventors and scientists [PERSON]6, [PERSON]7, [PERSON]8, [PERSON]9, [ORGANIZATION]0. On [ORGANIZATION]4, the surface parking lots that encircle the buildings are empty. There is still prime acreage for sale in [ORGANIZATION]0, and while the focus of [ORGANIZATION] development has shifted to downtown, former [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]1, who guided the renewed plan for the center of [ORGANIZATION], said, [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]0 has got to adapt as well. [ORGANIZATION]2, who succeeded [PERSON]0 as [ORGANIZATION]3 economic development director and later become GPE7 executive, agreed that [ORGANIZATION]0 needs a mixed use development. People like to live where they work, [ORGANIZATION]4 said, recalling her experience as a top executive of [LOCATION]3 on [ORGANIZATION]7 in [ORGANIZATION] west of [ORGANIZATION]0, where there was a bar in the building, a deli, a dry cleaner, and hotels and restaurants that the staff used nearby. A Familiar Setting The former [ORGANIZATION] Co. head[ORGANIZATION]7s now a grocery store, with a health space on the lowest level. Photo by [PERSON] The room on the top of the old [ORGANIZATION] Co. head[ORGANIZATION]7s was as familiar to me as any in [ORGANIZATION]. The modern chandeliers with parallel panes of glass are gone, the air ducts exposed and the floor bare, but the balconies still overlook LOC2. I have this visual memory of a late [DATE]7 [ORGANIZATION]9 meeting of the [ORGANIZATION] Co. there, with top executives sitting at an elevated table, getting ready to start the meeting. One called out to me, a lowly business reporter for a [ORGANIZATION]6 community paper, about a news brief that had run with the headline [ORGANIZATION] has bad [ORGANIZATION]7. Heck, it was just a rewrite of a press release, and maybe the headline did overblow the financial results, but whats the big deal? The big deal that I didnt realize till then was that in [ORGANIZATION]8 before the Internet put everything online, stock analysts would subscribe to dinky local publications where public companies operated, looking for clues and problems the companies would not freely disclose. The space once called [ORGANIZATION]8, and later [ORGANIZATION]9, was long the scene of the [ORGANIZATION]9 party of The [ORGANIZATION] Foundation, where you were likely to see all the movers and shakers in town. It was the site of memorial services as well. This was also where [LOCATION]5, the [ORGANIZATION] Co. successor, had unveiled some of the first illustrations of how [ORGANIZATION] downtown might look. Afterward, [PERSON]4 and I would briefly discuss my book idea, he suggesting I should write about [ORGANIZATION] as a lived experience, as I am doing in these installments. In this room [PERSON]0, I sat among mostly old friends and acquaintances to get an update on the downtown plans that may, at long last, 36 [ORGANIZATION]2 after the original target date for completion, accomplish the goal of [ORGANIZATION] downtown as a complete city, not just a better suburb, as Jim [ORGANIZATION] had said. Other people had their own memories of the room, now an unoccupied floor over the [LOCATION]6 grocery. This is where I had my prom, said [ORGANIZATION] Executive [ORGANIZATION]5, who graduated from nearby [LOCATION]7 as [ORGANIZATION] was being built in the [DATE]7. The [PERSON]3 event was ostensibly to provide an update on the progress of the downtown plan to put the final touches on the remaining 391 acres of town center, already 10 [ORGANIZATION]2 in the works and six [ORGANIZATION]2 since its formal passage. [PERSON]6, [ORGANIZATION]6 introduced legislation moving forward the final elements of the plan. [ORGANIZATION] is not inevitable, he told an audience of about 150 invited guests, all previously involved in the planning. We need to jump start the plan. ... We need to make sure this happens before were all 95 [ORGANIZATION]2 old. Health will occupy this new building being completed at [ORGANIZATION]. Photo by [PERSON] The key is to make the new [ORGANIZATION] core into a [STREET] to live, work and play, built around the towns first public structure, a revived FAC21, [ORGANIZATION]6 said. [ORGANIZATION] Hughes Corp., [LOCATION]9 spin-off, is calling this area [PERSON]. It combines apartments, retail, offices and public institutions in a walkable mix with a decidedly urban feel. Plans call for 6,400 residential units -- up 900 from the [PERSON]8 plan -- 4.3 million square feet of office space, 1.25 million square feet of retail and a 640-room hotel. Building a [PERSON]9 city is one of the reasons I moved here from [PERSON] County, said [ORGANIZATION] [TIME] Chair [ORGANIZATION]7. Revitalization is the right word for what were doing here, and the enhanced center of culture and commerce already in the works is exactly what we need. His council colleague [ORGANIZATION]8, whose West [ORGANIZATION] district includes downtown, told the audience, If [ORGANIZATION] is only a great [STREET] to raise a family, what are we missing? How are we bringing young people into the community? Having lived here 44 [ORGANIZATION]2, I continue to wait for the promise to happen, [ORGANIZATION]9 said. The cocktail hour reception was really a pep rally for the final implementation of the downtown plan. A key element, long planned but not much publicized, is a proposed 93 million tax increment financing, dubbed a [ORGANIZATION]. It authorizes the county to float bonds based on the tax proceeds from future development to pay for infrastructure, in this case a 2,500-space parking garage designed to service FAC22 in the evenings and DATE51, and office buildings during DATE52. When the county council began holding extended hearings on the proposals DATE53, it became clear why supporters of the plan needed to be rallied. Speaker after speaker in two [TIME] sessions decried the plans. Key sticking points are the [ORGANIZATION] -- many called it a handout to the developer, a free ride -- and [TIME] Member [ORGANIZATION]0 push to increase the amount of affordable housing from 10 to 15. That increase was favored even by some of those backing other elements of the plan. Too Dense, Too High, Too Many The densest part of the new development called [PERSON]. Illustration by [ORGANIZATION] Hughes Corp. Over and over, the council heard people say there were too many apartments, they would overload the schools, the hospital, the roads traffic would be terrible, like the mall at DATE54 but [PERSON]. The proposed buildings were too high most of the residences are seven stories and the few tall office buildings are 14 stories. There would be too many people and too much density -- though the amount of [ORGANIZATION] and trees shown on site maps and renderings is more than downtown [ORGANIZATION]8 or [ORGANIZATION]9. [ORGANIZATION]1 had moved her family to [ORGANIZATION] for the schools and pathways. Im very concerned with the urbanization. ... The density of this plan seems to have no limit. We wanted the suburban lifestyle. If we wanted a city, we had plenty of other choices, [ORGANIZATION]2 said. That sort thinking runs counter to most of those who developed the downtown plan, like [ORGANIZATION]1, who devoted immense time and energy as county executive to enacting it. People want to live in cities, urban centers that are walk-able and bike-able, said [ORGANIZATION]3, now an economic development consultant. You want the right mix. Whats the scale whats the mix? How tall should a building be? [ORGANIZATION]3 faced opposition all along the [STREET]. I dont begrudge peoples anxieties about change, [ORGANIZATION]3 said. But things change while youre fighting change. Weve had a great 50 [ORGANIZATION]2 in [ORGANIZATION], said [ORGANIZATION]3, DATE57, born and raised in [ORGANIZATION] and now raising his own family here.

Meetings for this, meetings for that, I hate them. Youve worn me out and Im sick of your religion while you go right on doing wrong. When you put on your next performance of prayer and speaking, no matter how long or loud you speak, I will not be listening. Do you want to know why? Because youve been tearing people to pieces, and your hands are bloody. Go home, wash up, clean up your act, sweep your lives clean of your evil doings, so I dont have to look at them any longer. Say no to wrong. Learn to do good. Work for justice. Help the down and out. Stand up for the homeless. Go to bat for the defenseless."
baltimore,2019-11-19T00:00:00Z,CQ Transcriptions,The Baltimore Sun,affordable housing,[ORGANIZATION],"Weve spent a lot of time in this committee talking about affordable housing and the crisis thats hurting so many of our constituents across the country. One possible solution to the crunch in my district is manufactured housing, which can be more than 30 percent cheaper than traditional housing. Nationwide, almost 3 million manufactured homes are anchored in land leased communities, which means that residents own the homes but least the land underneath them. And many of these communities are being purchased by big, outside investors and increasingly, private equity firms. So Id like to talk about how tenants are affected by increased private equity investment in land leased communities."
baltimore,2019-11-19T00:00:00Z,CQ Transcriptions,The Baltimore Sun,affordable housing,[ORGANIZATION],"So we all know that the homes in mobile home parks are truly not mobile and that the residents are effectively a--a captive audience. What Id like to reiterate here is that manufactured homes can be a solution for affordable housing, a great solution, but only if we can address the problem of outside investors buying up MHCs and raising rents to extract as much profit as they can from the people that live there. So we, absolutely, need to address that. We want to make sure that every person in this country has access to a--a nice roof over their head and that their children can grow up in a safe environment."

We targeted homelessness, and we reduced recidivism in our jails. And we could have done these--these projects without financial partners. But I know that the desire to invest in projects that have more than a monetary return are not just limited to government problems, you see a range of investments in clean energy technologies and social welfare issues, for example. Our state, local, and federal governments and nonprofits dont always have the resources to solve problems by themselves, and I know that firsthand."
baltimore,2016-11-03T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,The Baltimore Sun,affordable housing,Part 4 Columbia at 50: [ORGANIZATION] in the New Town: Communications part of building community; the [ORGANIZATION] and the rest,"It turned out to be a smart decision that gave [ORGANIZATION] of employment, opportunity and influence. He was attracted by the enthusiasm of the new editor, [PERSON]. PERSON2 says she recognized that [ORGANIZATION] was better at reporting on zoning than she was, and she also offered a small raise. Despite that, I didnt say yes until I had a face-to-face with [ORGANIZATION], the publisher, [ORGANIZATION] said. [ORGANIZATION]s future wife, [ORGANIZATION], was working as a bank teller at the time, and she had warned me that the ORG1 checks sometimes bounced. When I asked him about this, [ORGANIZATION] said that would never be a problem with my paycheck, and it wasnt. PERSON6 and I moved to ORG2 DATE1, in [DATE]. [ORGANIZATION], newly graduated from nursing school at ORG3, where all four of us had met, got a job as a visiting nurse on her first interview. I got a job with another newspaper in town, [ORGANIZATION], which was supposedly recapitalizing. An array of local newspapers serving ORG2 in [LOCATION]., taken from the files of [ORGANIZATION]. Photo by [DATE] [ORGANIZATION] survived for another issue or two and then died without a trace. I sued the publisher for pay. All I got was an office desk and chair. Other newspapers have come and gone ORG2 Villager, the News ORG2n an edition of the conservative [ORGANIZATION], The ORG2 [PERSON] an edition of ORG10, and a bit later, [ORGANIZATION]. In [DATE], dailies would enter the local market with ORG12 and ORG13. There were other publications along the [STREET], [LOCATION] among them. But the paper that would become the dominant news source for ORG2s [PERSON] was that puny little free shopper that started on a dining room table. ORG16 is one of the thinner volumes in the many Green Books that document the meticulous planning and proposals for all aspects of ORG2 life. The whole subject of communications in the planning of ORG2 can only be described as a mystical religious icon which everybody revered with poignant regularity, wrote PERSON9, ORG17 director of institutional planning. Weve got to think about communications, people would say. But nobody ever really did anything about it, except write long reports for longer conferences and got more and more people into the act to share the general confusion. We got intrigued with technology for technologys sake and lost track of function, [PERSON]0 observed. Although their focus was on technology, the goal of the planners remained the same as for the village centers and neighborhood gathering places encouraging community life and spirit. The early planners reached out to the companies that were developing futuristic technologies that would become the driving forces of American communications in [ORGANIZATION] of [ORGANIZATION] cable TV and then the Internet. But the planners were DATE8 as they contemplated interactive TV loops and other forms of electronic two-[STREET] communications. For those DATE9 and those who have forgotten, its worth refreshing what communications was like in DATE10. There were telephones, an invention of DATE11, but they were all what we now call landlines, connected by copper wires, owned and operated by a single local monopoly we called the telephone company. There were urban TV stations, most of them part of the three major networks, broadcast over the airwaves to [ORGANIZATION]. And radio, the [PERSON] invention, was available almost everywhere. All these systems were regulated by the government at the federal or state level, with a complicated set of licensing. ORG18 had a radio studio in the lower level of the ORG2 Mall in DATE13. Photo by ORG18 engineer [PERSON]1. Some of the planners at ORG19 wanted its own radio station, but that didnt happen until ORG18, a [ORGANIZATION] station, set up a small studio in the mall in DATE13. It lasted DATE14. ORG2s central location in the [PERSON]-[PERSON] corridor put it at the edge of both these big media markets. The available television channels were used up, with only slim possibilities for a [ORGANIZATION] channel and an AM radio station. In [PERSON], after much back and forth, [LOCATION], ORG21, the ORG22 division managing the new town, announced that ORG23 had been granted a franchise to establish cable television in ORG2. But the cable franchises were still under local control, and ORG23 backed out when it balked at provisions in the [ORGANIZATION] legislation. A local group won the rights in a partnership with [PERSON]. The GPE3 franchise was sold to ORG25, which became ORG26 in DATE16. ORG27 [PERSON]2 moved to ORG2 in DATE17, DATE18 FAC1 in ORG2 opened, conveniently located between [PERSON] where he worked as a reporter for ORG28 and his wifes job in GPE4. At first it was just convenient then we became converts to the ORG2 vision of an integrated, inclusive community, said [PERSON]3, now press secretary to [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]4. For DATE19, [ORGANIZATION] had a bureau located in [LOCATION] next to [ORGANIZATION] staffed by reporter [PERSON]5. TV was very, very competitive then, said [PERSON]3. He eventually spent [DATE]0 at [ORGANIZATION] before retiring to run for ORG30 in [DATE]1. ORG2 was a story at that point as the new town grew, he said. We did a birth[DATE] story pretty much [DATE]. Many [PERSON] TV personalities made ORG2 their home, recalled [PERSON]3 the late [PERSON]6, [PERSON]7, [PERSON]8, [PERSON]9, and briefly, a young PERSON20, among others. Throughout [DATE]2, [ORGANIZATION] and ORG2 have been part of a tug of war for eyeballs between rival TV stations for this lucrative, high-income market. There were many TV stories about the progressive ideas embodied in the ORG2 concept, such as interfaith religious centers, but at some point it stopped being new, said [PERSON]3. Yet, for all that, these were stories done for a wider regional audience. In [DATE]3, the ORG2 community relied on the oldest of the mass media, newspapers, and for [DATE]4 that medium was [ORGANIZATION], from its start delivered free to all the households in town. [ORGANIZATION] staff, including [ORGANIZATION], sometime in [DATE]5 in the foyer of the [ORGANIZATION] building. In the lower center are Publisher [ORGANIZATION] and General Manager [PERSON]. [ORGANIZATION]9itor [ORGANIZATION] PERSON25 is at the very bottom right [DATE] is second person to his left. Photographer unknown. The [ORGANIZATION] [DATE]6 after [ORGANIZATION] folded and two non-journalism jobs later, a position finally opened at [ORGANIZATION], where I had done some freelance writing. I had already helped the [ORGANIZATION] move from its small flexi size into the tabloid it became in [DATE]7, growing to 64 pages. After I became associate editor in [DATE]8, I covered education, business and politics. In [DATE]9, I wrote the cover story for its first 100-page issue, a piece titled [ORGANIZATION] on efforts to ban some books from school libraries. We now know that we were all working in the hey[DATE] of the newspaper industry not just in ORG2 or [PERSON], but in GPE6. Advertising revenues were bulging, profits were ballooning, staffing soared at every publication. There were people who loved the [ORGANIZATION] there were people who hated the [ORGANIZATION], particularly the liberal bent of its publisher [ORGANIZATION] and his [LOCATION]0 ORG34. But love it or hate it, people read it. At one point, a survey found that 92 of ORG2ns read the paper that landed free [LOCATION]1 on their doorsteps and driveways. This was not your traditional newspaper produced by traditional newspaper people. Its models were magazines and the alternative city papers that grew out of the [LOCATION]2 counterculture. Its editors didnt just read ORG35 and ORG36, but ORG37 and ORG38. It was in sharp contrast to its stodgy competitors, like the ORG39. The ORG1 sketchy origins in [LOCATION]3 certainly gave no hint of the powerhouse it would become. I got pissed at something in the [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON], recalled PERSON22 in a recent interview from his home in [LOCATION], [LOCATION] I didnt have a vision. The first issue of the [ORGANIZATION] was indeed a flyer eight pages of legal paper folded with a [PERSON] ad on the front, ads for cars and tires, and a calendar of events. This first issue on ORG2s [DATE] birth[DATE] in [LOCATION]3 was reprinted several times over [DATE]2 as a reminder of how far the newspaper had come. When [PERSON] joined the fledgling operation as a writer [LOCATION]4, free circulation had grown to 9,000, and there was real news in the [ORGANIZATION], but they were still cutting and pasting the typewritten copy on a dining room table. At the time, PERSON22 wrote To reflect the growth of a new city like ORG2 is to meet new challenges. It calls on a publisher to throw away the old and tired concept of journalism. Journalism is more than just information and news. Journalism should excite and guide a community. That statement was still being pointed to [LOCATION]5 in a history of the paper given to new staff members of a much larger enterprise. PERSON23, who had come to ORG2 with her husband PERSON24 for his job as an architect at ORG19, was totally on board with the concept of community journalism that we werent dailies and the mission was to play a role in the community, she recalled recently. By [LOCATION]6, PERSON23 was editor and general manager, she had hired PERSON25, and the staff had grown several times. By the time I joined the staff on [DATE], [DATE]8, it was operating out of a building on [PERSON]. It moved again to FAC5, and in [LOCATION]8, we moved into the [ORGANIZATION] building on [ORGANIZATION], an unusual building designed by PERSON24 PERSON23, standing out amid the towns bland architecture, with its white metal sides and sloping fronts of glass. There were no crusty old editors looking over our shoulders, telling us we dont do that here. PERSON2 and [ORGANIZATION] and we often talked about them that [STREET] in this family-like operation were still in their [LOCATION]9 [ORGANIZATION] and I were in [DATE]0, and the staff was of similar age. While [ORGANIZATION] and I did take photos, we eventually brought on a staff of talented photographers who made that a hallmark of the paper in [DATE]1. The [ORGANIZATION] was more than just a writers paper. Whats striking going through boxes of old clips I dragged out for this series was how closely we covered this new community the opening of restaurants, the closing of stores, the community dustups, the arguments over tot lots and door colors, the nitty-gritty of every[DATE] life. While there were wonderful photo spreads and long features, there was also column after column of notices about routine events and meetings. Because of [PERSON]s proclivities, there was massive coverage of the performing arts, not just in ORG2 [PERSON] was going strong as a venue for big acts, but in [PERSON] and [PERSON] too. There was local sports galore including the long-time [LOCATION]0 column by [ORGANIZATION] called [ORGANIZATION], a column that predated my arrival and survived long after I left [DATE]2. PERSON29, like many of the other writers, was community bred. His [DATE] job was at ORG41 where he did what can never be disclosed and where they answered the phones cryptically with the last four digits of the extension you called. Most of us lived in ORG2. We were part of the community, and the community was part of the paper. Page three had the signed ORG34 none of this unsigned editorial page stuff of the old school and then there were the letters, so many letters from ORG2ns, often complaining about [ORGANIZATION]s emotional diatribes or other coverage that pushed the envelope, like the time we put the full-page image of a mammogram on the cover to illustrate a story on breast cancer. The [ORGANIZATION] was the [STREET] the community talked to itself, understood itself, remembered itself. The advertising flowed in all the newspaper staples cars, groceries, real estate, classifieds. The smartest thing was not selling ads by the inch, as dailies did, producing those odd-shaped page wells, PERSON22 said. The [ORGANIZATION] sold eighth-, quarter- and half-pages that made design easier and more attractive. More advertising meant more money, more pages, more stories to fill them, more staff to write and illustrate them, and more listings and made it a more attractive target for acquisition. The Sale of the [ORGANIZATION] The night of Nov. 7, 1978, a major gubernatorial election, I was covering the returns in FAC8 in [LOCATION], and a reporter from the [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] asked me my reaction to the sale of [ORGANIZATION]. I was floored. Sale, what sale? PERSON2 had tried to have me tracked down [TIME] this was [DATE]3 before cell phones so I would not learn of the deal from our local competitors who had gotten wind of it. Who were these guys at [ORGANIZATION]? Turns out these guys and yes, they were all guys were some of the classiest in the business. The chairman, [ORGANIZATION]2, had been the publisher of the vaunted [LOCATION], and the president was [ORGANIZATION]3, former president of [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]4 had founded the company. It was one of the best things that ever happened to us. PERSON2 and [ORGANIZATION] were left fully in charge. [DATE]4 we bought ORG10 and other papers in the chain. I got to spend full-time in [PERSON]0 during the [DATE]5 sessions as political editor. When [ORGANIZATION]4 died in [DATE]6, the partners created a working fellowship that sent [ORGANIZATION] PERSON25 and then me to [PERSON]1 for [DATE]7 at ORG45, where [ORGANIZATION]5 had been the managing partner of a three-[STREET] ownership split with the [PERSON] and ORG36. We won award after award, both state and national, for writing in many categories, photography and design. The [ORGANIZATION] kept chugging along, and in [DATE]8, our newspaper group, now called [ORGANIZATION], bought ORG47 in [PERSON]2 and its five newspapers, including the [PERSON]2 [PERSON] and ORG49. I became managing editor of seven [PERSON] County papers. We never recovered from that purchase, said [PERSON] in a recent conversation. In hindsight, she said, We overpaid for those newspapers and struggled to make them generate enough return on that investment. Management began making cuts in [DATE]9 as [PERSON] experienced a harsher recession than the rest of the country. In [PERSON]0, a [ORGANIZATION] partner and [ORGANIZATION] told [PERSON] she needed to go, and in [PERSON]1, [PERSON]2 after I left, [TIME] and the [ORGANIZATION] were sold to the [PERSON] ORG39 and its new owner, [ORGANIZATION]. I really dont think the sale will change anything about the newspapers, PERSON22 told me for a story I wrote about the sale in [LOCATION]. Its not in their interest to screw it up. PERSON22 stayed on as a consultant for [DATE]7, having twice sold the same paper at a handsome profit. He was wrong about nothing changing. PERSON22 says now he had seen some of the handwriting on the wall [PERSON]3 as the Internet began to spread. I didnt understand it but I knew that it was only a period of time before newspapers would lose those categories of classifieds employment ads, real estate and cars. What began as small dips in revenue in [DATE]9 became a steady downhill slide and then, in [PERSON]4, as the Great Recession hit, newspaper revenues fell off the cliff. As advertising evaporated, pages and coverage were cut, as were the reporters and editors who produced them. Along the [STREET], [ORGANIZATION] sold the ORG39 and the local papers to [ORGANIZATION], which went private and then bankrupt for [PERSON]5, and now has the god-awful name of [LOCATION]. Over [DATE]2 it has decimated staff and closed offices, including the [ORGANIZATION] building on [ORGANIZATION] in [PERSON]6. The [ORGANIZATION] is now run by editors in the ORG39s downtown [PERSON] building. What were once several independent news operations in the city and the five counties that surround it are now under one owner, the [PERSON] ORG39 [ORGANIZATION], with copy shared among all. In the [ORGANIZATION] you can read articles you may have already read in the ORG39, or the other [STREET] around. From left, former ORG57 Publisher [ORGANIZATION]6, [ORGANIZATION] President [ORGANIZATION]7, who died in [PERSON]7, and former ORG57 [ORGANIZATION]9itor-in-Chief [ORGANIZATION]8, who died in [PERSON]8. The only locally owned and operated news outlet is [LOCATION], where this series is running before it is published here. Started in [DATE] DATE16 by [ORGANIZATION]9 and [ORGANIZATION]0 as [ORGANIZATION], it was geared to just a sliver of the community. It became [LOCATION] [ORGANIZATION]0 after PERSON22 registered all the other likely publication names, and the [ORGANIZATION]1 decided not to fight him. [ORGANIZATION]2 grew up as [ORGANIZATION]2 Ashbaugh in western [ORGANIZATION], married [ORGANIZATION]9 and had three children at a very young age. By the time they returned to [ORGANIZATION], they had run several newspapers in [PERSON]4, and radio stations as well. [ORGANIZATION]2, now [ORGANIZATION]2 [PERSON], says it was her idea to start a business paper here, with [ORGANIZATION]9 as editor. When [ORGANIZATION]9 soon after decided also to launch [ORGANIZATION], that was the last straw for [ORGANIZATION]2 after many, many straws with her spendthrift hubby. She called it quits on the marriage, but kept [LOCATION], 68,000 in debts and all. But aside from [ORGANIZATION]9s spending, It made money from the very first issue, she said. From its start, one of [LOCATION]s gems were the columns by [ORGANIZATION]5, ostensibly about his field of commercial real estate, but really wise and funny commentaries on public life. Under the moniker ORG63, he became one of the best and most provocative bloggers on local life and added a podcast with attorney [ORGANIZATION]6 to his media chops until he was brutally murdered in [ORGANIZATION]1. On [ORGANIZATION]2, a new [STREET] near [PERSON], where [ORGANIZATION]7 worked as a teenager, will be dedicated as part of ORG2s revitalized downtown. It will be called [ORGANIZATION]5 in an amusing tribute to an amusing writer in a town full of weird [STREET] names drawn from poetry and unconnected to persons living or dead. [ORGANIZATION]2 sold [LOCATION] in [ORGANIZATION]3 to [ORGANIZATION]8 and [ORGANIZATION]9. I worked with both sets of publishers from [ORGANIZATION]4 to [DATE]1, when I became ORG64 bureau chief of the [PERSON] Examiner, which covered [ORGANIZATION] in its typically haphazard [STREET], with its usually erratic free delivery, until its untimely demise in [ORGANIZATION]5. Not the Only Game in Town The [ORGANIZATION] was never the only game in town. The ORG39 had an [LOCATION] bureau for many [PERSON]5 with [ORGANIZATION]0 reporting there for [DATE]3 ORG66 and Evening ORG39 were represented too. In [ORGANIZATION]7, attempting to capture more suburban readers across the [PERSON] region, the ORG39 set up ORG12 with a separate, and lower paid, staff that competed strongly with the [ORGANIZATION] for stories and advertising. The ORG39 tried various configurations of separate [ORGANIZATION] sections for [PERSON]5 after it bought the [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON], and still has a thin section in the ORG39[DATE] paper, though the content is often shared. ORG35 also had [ORGANIZATION], part of a plan to open bureaus in all the counties it served. It leased premium space in downtown ORG2, but never filled it. It was later replaced by the GPE3 Extra. The [PERSON], for which I worked part-time on the national copy desk for eight [PERSON]5, and [ORGANIZATION] PERSON25 has for 16 [PERSON]5, has largely abandoned local coverage under the ownership of Amazons [ORGANIZATION]1. Many ORG2 residents mourn the loss of the [ORGANIZATION] they remember from [PERSON]5 ago, a fat, thriving community newspaper operation. [PERSON], who created a new career for herself as a public relations consultant to some of the biggest organizations in ORG2, said, People complain all the time about how thin the [ORGANIZATION] is. But she said those are people of our generation, meaning the [ORGANIZATION]2 crowd, bemoaning [ORGANIZATION]3. I dont feel a concern about creating community anymore, PERSON23 said. People see no need for a community newspaper. The ORG2 [ORGANIZATION] building on [ORGANIZATION] has sat vacant for several [PERSON]5 and may be torn down. Photo by [DATE]. [ORGANIZATION]2, now [ORGANIZATION]5, president of [ORGANIZATION] from [DATE] to [ORGANIZATION]4, is one of those who mourns the loss of the [ORGANIZATION], which he saw as crucial in creating a vibrant community. The building that housed that crucial community builder has sat empty for several [PERSON]5. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]3 wanted to turn it into a business incubator, but for the [ORGANIZATION]4 administration, the price tag was too high. It may now be torn down and replaced with affordable housing as part of downtown ORG2s revitalization. For [ORGANIZATION]5, the tearing down of the [ORGANIZATION] building stands as a metaphor for the decline of the newspaper industry as a whole. [ORGANIZATION]7 in ORG2 at 50 [ORGANIZATION] [DATE] [DATE] Len[PERSON][URL] has lived and worked in ORG2 as a journalist for more than 40 [PERSON]5. He is currently the editor and publisher of [PERSON][URL], a news website about state government and politics, and a political columnist for [LOCATION].

baltimore,2017-07-25T00:00:00Z,Impact News Service,The Baltimore Sun,homeless,[ORGANIZATION]: NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR DATE0--MOTION TO PROCEED--Continued,"[ORGANIZATION] is going to pay for that. To say that is insulting is a gross understatement. That is obscene. That is as close to uttering an obscenity as anything I can think of. So you bet we are going to fight when it comes to those kinds of decisions-- fight against those kinds of cuts. I mentioned that I had been on the [STREET] a good bit and have spent a lot of time in counties that are rural counties in [ORGANIZATION]. Just to give you an example of the numbers, I live in a [PERSON] that has 6DATE93 counties, and 48 of the 6DATE93 are rural. Those are our [ORGANIZATION] counties. If you add up all of the individuals in those 48 rural counties in [ORGANIZATION] who got insurance by [STREET] of the Me[ORGANIZATION] expansion--or received insurance in the marketplaces in [ORGANIZATION] between passage of the ORG[ORGANIZATION]6 and currently--just in those 48 counties, over 2DATE938,000 people have healthcare--2DATE938,2[ORGANIZATION]0. I use a precise number because right down to the [ORGANIZATION]0, it matters. Every single one of those individuals in those 48 rural counties should have an ironclad guarantee that no bill will pass ORG2 that will rip away their healthcare, not for one person. That should be our promise to them. That is the number of people covered, right? With the Me[ORGANIZATION] expansion plus the marketplace, 2DATE938,2[ORGANIZATION]0 residents of rural [ORGANIZATION] are covered. If the [ORGANIZATION] bill passed, here is at least one estimate of what would happen to those rural counties 151,000-plus people. I will not use the exact number because it is an estimate. The estimate is that around 1[ORGANIZATION]1,000 people would lose their health insurance. You move forward in rural [ORGANIZATION] by over 2DATE938,000 people then you take two steps backward and rip healthcare away from 1[ORGANIZATION]1,000 in rural [ORGANIZATION]. I havent gotten to the big population centers. That is the reality in [ORGANIZATION]. Then if you break it down even further--these are just 11 rural counties that I visited in [LOCATION] in addition to other counties. In 11 rural [ORGANIZATION] counties--these are counties with very small populations. One of them, [PERSON], which I was in [DATE], has a little more than DATE93,000 people in its total population. In these 11 rural [ORGANIZATION] counties, 54,[ORGANIZATION]60 people have healthcare [ORGANIZATION] because of Me[ORGANIZATION] expansion, plus those who got it through the marketplace, so 54,[ORGANIZATION]60 get healthcare. What is the estimate of who would lose if the bill passed? It is 32,410. Lets call it 30,000, roughly, because it is an estimate. So 54,000 gain then you rip it away from 30,000. Does that make any sense at all? Does that help the country? How are we stronger after that? How are we better off as a country or, in my case, as a [PERSON]? How are the people of our GPE2 better off when 30,000 in 11 rural counties lose their coverage--or 1[ORGANIZATION]1,000 in 48 rural counties? I know I am over my time, and I will wrap up because we have colleagues here. This is a pivotal moment. To say it is a pivotal moment for the [ORGANIZATION] is a big understatement, but it is also, I think, a pivotal moment for the country. We are going to be on a different path than we have been for a long time. Usually what happens over time is that you are expanding protections, enlarging the number of people who are the beneficiaries of protections of one kind or another. In this case, we would be going in the wrong direction. I hope our colleagues will think long and hard before they vote yes either to move forward to debate on a bill that is [ORGANIZATION] S4144 deeply flawed or to vote for the bill itself. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from [PERSON] Ms. [PERSON]. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from [ORGANIZATION] for being here. We have been out here many a night, talking about the importance of Me[ORGANIZATION]. I so appreciate his leadership in the [ORGANIZATION] on this very important issue. He has been a champion of [LOCATION] and has been a voice amongst all Senators in making sure that people have access to healthcare. I so appreciate being out here with him [TIME]. I dont really appreciate being here right at this moment. I am really flabbergasted. Why are we here at this moment? Why are we here? I am pretty sure that President [PERSON], when he was candidate [PERSON], put in a tweet that he would not cut Me[ORGANIZATION]. Yet that is the proposal we are talking about. No matter what the proposal is--repeal, the [ORGANIZATION] bill, the proposal scored by [ORGANIZATION] or some [ORGANIZATION] alternative on junk insurance--they all are a cut to Me[ORGANIZATION], so I am not sure how we are here. I am not sure how we are here when the Vice President at the time campaigned, I am sure, against the Affordable Care Act and then became Governor of GPE4 and implemented Me[ORGANIZATION] expansion in his own [PERSON]. After saying that he was against the Affordable Care Act, he implemented Me[ORGANIZATION] expansion. I am sure people in his home [PERSON] said If you want to take care of people, if you want to raise our standard of living, if you want to keep down the costs of healthcare delivery and private insurance, put people on coverage so that they arent driving up the cost of uncompensated care. So how are we here? How are we here when our [ORGANIZATION] colleagues came up with a proposal that basically cuts 23 million people off of healthcare--including 15 million people on Me[ORGANIZATION]--after working with the President, who said that he didnt want to cut Me[ORGANIZATION], and the Vice President, who basically campaigned against it and then went ahead and expanded it? I cant believe how many times I have been on the [ORGANIZATION] floor, and I havent seen one of my colleagues come down here and talk about solutions that they are proposing. I just hear them come and talk about the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and kicking millions of people off of the healthcare they currently have. [TIME], I can imagine there are many people across [PERSON] who are like me, thinking, how could this be happening? How could we be sitting here [TIME], not knowing what the [ORGANIZATION] is going to vote on, not knowing whether they are going to repeal their health insurance, not knowing where their Senators stand or even if the Senator knows what proposal they are voting on? Yet I can tell you this More than DATE930 percent of the [PERSON] people think the ideas that have now been put forth by the [ORGANIZATION] and the [ORGANIZATION] Republicans and the President do not work. They are not the [STREET] to increase access to healthcare and [STREET] down the cost of private insurance in the insurance market. You dont have to take my word for it. I am looking at a statement by [PERSON]3s Republican Governor, [LOCATION]. I worked with [LOCATION] in the [ORGANIZATION] of Representatives. He was a budget hawk. He wanted to figure out how to make things work. So I trust that, as Governor, he is a fiscal steward about how to get things done when he says Until [ORGANIZATION] can step back from political gamesmanship and come together with a workable, bipartisan plan, it is a mistake for the [ORGANIZATION] to proceed with a vote on [ORGANIZATION] and force a one-sided deal that the [PERSON] people are clearly against. So why are we here? Why are we here when a President promised that he wasnt going to cut Me[ORGANIZATION], a Vice President said that he was against the bill but then went and did Me[ORGANIZATION] expansion? The people in [LOCATION] responded very clearly that they are not interested in cutting millions of people off of health insurance because they know that, even if it doesnt affect their family, it doesnt make common sense for keeping down the costs of healthcare. So I ask my colleagues to stop and think about the people in [PERSON] who are clearly scared to death about what is going to happen [PERSON]. They are scared that someone in their family or that they, the provider for their family, are not going to be able to provide insurance. If you are so brave, come down here and volunteer, as an amendment, to cut all of us--cut the [ORGANIZATION] off of our access to health insurance until we come up with some idea that you think is so terrific. I doubt you will come and propose that. You wouldnt want your family cut off of healthcare. I meet people like [ORGANIZATION], who came to visit me from ORG9, who at [ORGANIZATION] was diagnosed with a condition that affected her brain tissues and spinal canal. She was from GPEDATE93, and she was referred to ORG10 because it is the pediatric referral center for our region. Thanks to Me[ORGANIZATION], she saw 11 different pediatric subspecialists and had 13 brain surgeries and DATE93 back surgeries. Her mom told me that without Me[ORGANIZATION] and without the prohibition on [PERSON]6 caps, she wouldnt have access to healthcare [ORGANIZATION]. Is that what my Republican colleagues want to say [PERSON], that we dont really know for sure how we are going to do this, we dont really know what works, but even though we said we werent going to cut Me[ORGANIZATION], we are going to cut people off of health insurance who currently have coverage? I think the reason why people like these Governors from Republican [PERSON]s have been willing to speak out against this proposal and raise their concerns is because they have to be a steward of Me[ORGANIZATION], and they have to be fiscally responsible. So they know there are better ways. When I talk to the regional hospitals in my [PERSON], they tell me that covering more people under Me[ORGANIZATION] has created downward pressure on price in the individual market. It has helped us. So our solution cannot be decimating the Me[ORGANIZATION] market. Our solution has to look at those in the individual market who dont have as much clout as a big employer or somebody who can buy in bulk and [STREET] down their price. There are ways to address that issue. I look forward to working with my colleagues on those solutions, but that is not what is being recommended [PERSON]. Those solutions havent been put forth, nor are they part of any of these proposals. So I ask my colleagues to not proceed. The President promised he was not going to cut Me[ORGANIZATION], and now it is like you want somebody to jump off the cliff [PERSON], and you are saying Oh, by the [STREET], I will throw you a parachute on the [STREET] down. It doesnt work. As my colleagues have said here [TIME], it is time to give certainty to this population that we have a proposal that will help continue to give them access to care. I would say to my colleagues that taking a vote on politics when it is the lives and the healthcare access that so many millions of [PERSON]s seek--dont play politics with healthcare. Lets get a solution that works and works on both sides of the aisle. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from [LOCATION]. Mr. [PERSON]. Mr. President, let me open my remarks by saying that from the very beginning of this ill-starred healthcare misadventure the Republicans have been on, Democrats have over and over again offered to help and to participate. Over and over again, we have spoken to, for instance, [PERSON]man PERSON5 on [ORGANIZATION], saying Give us a shot. Try something. We can do this. You have talked DATEDATE93 about regular order. How many times have we heard the majority leader say that regular order is the [STREET] to go and talk about how important the [ORGANIZATION] is because it follows regular order? It looks as though all of that was nothing but a lot of bunkum because when he had the chance to come here and actually trust the [ORGANIZATION] to work through regular order, what did he do? DATE8, he jammed through reconciliation to open a purely partisan pathway to undoing ORG[LOCATION]08. Well, people have discovered that a lot of what they thought was their [ORGANIZATION] S4145 good healthcare is ORG[LOCATION]08. So people on Me[ORGANIZATION], people whose private policies now dont have preexisting condition limits, caps on how much can be spent in DATE9 or in [LOCATION]0, folks who will get their money through the exchange, suddenly they have all discovered Oh my gosh, that was ORG[LOCATION]08. Dont take that away from me. That is one of the reasons we see all of the groups who come here concerned about healthcare lined up against this bill. This bill, other than the creepy cabal of billionaires who are behind it, doesnt have a friend. And it just shows how narrow ORG13 has now become that they will follow the creepy billionaires off the cliff against the advice of so many respected [PERSON] organizations. How about [LOCATION]? [PERSON] says that the Republican bill would leave patients and those with preexisting conditions paying more for less coverage. They have come out against the bill. I have a constituent home in [LOCATION], and her name is [PERSON]. She and her daughters live in a beautiful [STREET] in [LOCATION], [PERSON]0, [PERSON]1. Like a lot of people I have heard from, [PERSON] is afraid. She is afraid that what this [ORGANIZATION] is going to do is to repeal the Affordable Care Act and let health insurers go back to discriminating against people with preexisting conditions. What is hers? Well, [PERSON] and her daughters have a genetic mutation, and that genetic mutation increases their risk of cancer. They would ordinarily be counting on [LOCATION] to argue for them, and sure enough, [LOCATION] has come out against the Republican health legislation. Well, it got real for [PERSON] [LOCATION]1 when her DATE[LOCATION]08 daughter was battling breast cancer. Fortunately, her health insurance covered her treatment, and it worked. She is now cancer-free. But because of their genetic mutation, [PERSON] and her daughters will need to be screened frequently for the rest of their lives. Under the Affordable Care Act, these potentially lifesaving screenings are covered, and [PERSON] and her daughters are not penalized for having a preexisting condition. Why on [PERSON] would you want to go back to a world in which those two things werent true? [PERSON] wrote A genetic mutation is not caused by an unhealthy or careless lifestyle, as some members of [ORGANIZATION] seem to think. You can do everything right and still end up with cancer or another debilitating disease. So she urged me to consider all the people who would be affected by the new healthcare bill, not just looking out for the rich and the healthy. Another group who came out against this was ORG16, the [ORGANIZATION]. This bill may have changed, but the results are the same. The results are higher costs and less coverage for older [PERSON]s. Why would you want to do that? And this isnt just language from the [ORGANIZATION] it comes home again. PERSONDATE93 from GPE[LOCATION]08, up in northern [LOCATION]--a bucolic, rural part of [LOCATION]--wrote to share her experience with the Affordable Care Act. This is her and her husbands [LOCATION]3 on their ORG[ORGANIZATION]6 plan. Like many [LOCATION]ers, they qualify for financial assistance to help them afford their health insurance. You would think that would be a good thing. PERSONDATE93 thinks it is a good thing. She wrote to me that she thanks God [ORGANIZATION]2 that they have quality health insurance they can afford. Her husband is a welder fabricator--a job that takes a toll. He has had several blood tests [LOCATION]4 and recently began seeing a hematologist. PERSONDATE93 knows that this type of specialty care would have been out of reach for their family without their current coverage, and so she is worried. She is frightened by the Republican health plan. She and her husband are [LOCATION]5. They are within [ORGANIZATION]s interests. And she understands that because of their age, under the Republican plan, their premiums could go up five to eight times what they are paying [ORGANIZATION]--five to eight times what they are paying [ORGANIZATION]-- and the tax credits that have been proposed, in PERSONDATE93s words, wont cut it. Doctors know a little bit about healthcare, and [LOCATION] has come out in opposition. The BCRA . . . will not preserve and improve essential coverage, benefits and consumer protections, and access to care is their concern. Of course, why would you want to listen to the doctors about healthcare when you have a little pack of creepy billionaires who are telling you what to do? Never bother to listen to the doctors. Well, PERSON9 from [PERSON]4, [PERSON]1, is a doctor. She is a physician who works at a community mental [INSTITUTION] in [PERSON]5. [PERSON]0 told me that she sees the benefits of the Affordable Care Act [LOCATION]6. She treats patients with serious mental illnesses, and they have what she called tremendous healthcare and social service needs. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, almost all of her patients were uninsured, and she spent her [ORGANIZATION]3 scrambling to try to find different avenues to get them free care, to get them whatever they could scrounge. Since the expansion of Me[ORGANIZATION] under the Affordable Care Act, she said, almost all of her patients have health insurance and they are able to get the medical care they need. As [PERSON]0 put it, with all of their life challenges, at least they dont have to worry that they cant afford care. ORG21 is a favorite target of our Republican friends, and ORG21 is strongly opposed to these measures. Women get a lot of their healthcare from ORG21. ORG21 said With this latest version of [PERSON]Care, women will pay the biggest price of all. [PERSON]1 is a young woman living in [PERSON]5 who shared her experience with me about how ORG21 has been a reliable source of healthcare for her throughout her life. As a college student, [PERSON]1 went to ORG21 for birth control and well-woman care. She had a routine exam, and a doctor at ORG21 found a lump in her breast. [LOCATION]DATE93 and far from her family, [PERSON]1 said she was worried but never felt alone. ORG21 connected her with the followup care and testing that she needed. She was treated by their doctors. Fortunately, the mass turned out to be benign, but [PERSON]1 says she is forever grateful to ORG21 for their help to her during a scary situation for a young woman. [PERSON]1 is still a patient at ORG21, and she even volunteers at their health clinic in [PERSON]5. She knows firsthand how important ORG21 is for healthcare for millions of men and women across the country--particularly women--and, like the other people who have written to me, she is afraid of what will happen if Republicans succeed in defunding ORG21. Small business folks have spoken to me about this. There is a lot of talk about how you need more freedom not to have insurance and freedom to be told you cant have insurance if you are sick. That is not the kind of freedom I think we really want to support around here. The freedom we want to support is for somebody to be able to follow their dreams, and over and over again, I hear from people who are able to get free of being linked to their employer healthcare plan and go out on their own because of the Affordable Care Act. PERSON[LOCATION]08 is a small business owner in our capital city, [PERSON]5. She and her husband own an architectural design and construction firm that builds homes around [LOCATION]. Construction is not a line of work you want to be in without health insurance. Well, because of the Affordable Care Act, PERSON[LOCATION]08 and her husband have affordable health insurance and dental coverage, and they have it for the first time. They can see the doctors they want to see, and their out-of-pocket costs are reasonable. The Affordable Care Act has allowed small business owners like PERSON[LOCATION]08 and her husband to pursue their professional dreams, boosting our local economy and creating jobs for others without having to risk their livelihoods and life savings if an illness or an injury befalls them. [TIME], I was in [PERSON]6, [PERSON]1, and a woman came up to me to say When you get back down there, please fight for us on the Affordable Care Act. [ORGANIZATION] S4146 She said The Affordable Care Act has given me two things. One, it has given me my freedom. Because of the Affordable Care Act, I was able to leave my employer-supported program and have the confidence to go out on my own and become an illustrator. Her business is so successful that she has actually started hiring people to support her business. She said That freedom to be an entrepreneur, to succeed, would never ever have happened if I had been chain-locked to my employer program and did not have an affordable option like the Affordable Care Act provides. Second, she said Once I did this, once I started my business, I then went for checkups. I was able to get tests that I could not have gotten before, and what they found was a tumor behind my eye. Luckily, it was not cancerous, but had they not caught it, she said, I would have lost my sight. If you are an illustrator, being blind is a very tough proposition. She said I have my freedom, and I have my sight because of this law. [PERSON]3, fight for me. [PERSON]4 from [PERSON]DATE93 is the last person I will mention [TIME]. She wrote in to share how important the Affordable Care Act has been to her and her husband and how important our [LOCATION] marketplace has been for her. She said There may be marketplaces that arent working in different places around the country. Fine, go fix those. Dont mess with mine. It is working in [LOCATION], and [PERSON]4 is one of the beneficiaries of it. She is now retired. She lives with her husband [PERSON]5 in [PERSON]DATE93. Before the Affordable Care Act, she tried to buy health insurance in the individual market, and it was quoted to her at [DATE]--not affordable to her, not with limited income like that. So [PERSON]4 and [PERSON]5 have quality affordable insurance through [LOCATION]s health insurance exchange, and they are happy about it. Dont disrupt their lives. [PERSON]4 actually told me that her health insurance premium actually went down [LOCATION]4, and so she splurged with the savings and bought dental insurance as well. That was a success. She wrote to me I wouldnt have been able to afford healthcare if it wasnt for ORG[LOCATION]08. Like so many of these other people who have written in, [PERSON]4 says that she and [PERSON]5 are scared to death that they will lose their insurance if the Affordable Care Act is repealed. She doesnt understand how some Members of [ORGANIZATION] can claim to care about their constituents and still try to repeal their healthcare coverage. [PERSON]4 said They have money and they have good insurance, and they must not know what it is like for people like us. Well, we need to remember those real people out there who are getting the Me[ORGANIZATION] benefit, who are getting affordable insurance through the exchanges and getting help with the premiums and the people who are on private insurance but no longer have to face [PERSON]6 caps or DATE[ORGANIZATION]6 caps or preexisting conditions. Even people who are still on ORG23 have gotten a benefit from this. Why would we want to take that all away? The last thing I want to mention is this. Those are all personal stories, and it is really important to remember that behind this creepy billionaire effort to perform some kind of ideological experiment on people by taking away their healthcare, there are actually real people who are really going to suffer in their real lives, and it will have been deliberately done to them by people here who simply couldnt say no to the creepy billionaires. There is another piece of this. It is a little more complicated, but I will close on this. I love to use this graph. I use it all the time. This axis of the graph shows how long people live in different countries. The range is from DATE[ORGANIZATION]DATE93 86. This part of the graph shows how much people pay in different countries for healthcare per [DATE]0. Virtually everybody that we compete with is right in here--GPE[ORGANIZATION]DATE93, [ORGANIZATION], GPE22, and GPE23. They are right in here. They do pretty well on life expectancy, and here they are in this cross of the 2,000 to 6,000 per [DATE]0 range. The most expensive other country in the world is GPE24, at 6,000 per [DATE]0. Look at where [LOCATION] is. We spend 8,[ORGANIZATION]10 per [DATE]0--[STREET] more, double more than what the average is of the other countries we compete against. For that we get super killer life expectancy. I guess killer life expectancy isnt the right phrase to use. But do you get great life expectancy on that vast expenditure of healthcare? No. We compete with GPE25. We compete with GPE26. Part of what the Affordable Care Act did was to try to focus on this. Here is the punch line. One of the things we do in [PERSON] is that we look at things in 10-[DATE]0 chunks. If you look at the 10-[DATE]0 chunk from [DATE]2, which is [LOCATION]4 right here, to [DATE]3, here is a 10-[DATE]0 period. What this graph shows is that, back here in [DATE]4, the [ORGANIZATION]ional [ORGANIZATION] did a prediction of what the healthcare costs for the country was going to be in this 10-[DATE]0 period. They said this is how much we are going to have to spend on [ORGANIZATION]5 healthcare. What happened is that we passed the Affordable Care Act and costs started to go down. They came in below expectations. Around here, they rebooted the test, and they did a new projection based on the new information for this same 10-[DATE]0 period. As you will notice, the costs that we have projected for that 10-[DATE]0 period from [DATE]2 to [DATE]3, inclusive, have fallen. They have fallen by 3.3 trillion. If you want to talk about savings on our debt and deficit, if you want to talk about savings in healthcare, this red line was projected before the Affordable Care Act, and the green line--the difference--was the projection after the Affordable Care Act was law and after the results began to come in. I cant promise you that every single one of those 3.3 trillion in savings was a direct result of a provision in the Affordable Care Act, but when we have delivered 3.3 trillion in savings, why would we never want to talk about that? Why would we want to put any of that at risk? Why would we want to go back to the preexisting condition of this prediction and pile 3.3 trillion back into that out-[DATE]0 period? It makes no sense. So whether you are a person who has constituents who are real and who are going to suffer, who are going to suffer in real life as a result of the decision and the vote that you cast [PERSON], or whether you are a propeller-headed budget hawk who just wants to figure out how you can reduce LOC0 costs, why would you vote for a bill and put any of this at risk? Why the fear of your constituents? Why the 3.3 trillion in savings? It makes no sense. I will end where I began. If people will come to their senses and want to do this in a bipartisan fashion, during regular order--boy, did we hear a lot about regular order until regular order wasnt wanted any longer--we are here. We want to work with you. There are tons of ideas out there. We can work to improve the healthcare system for the real people in the real world, and not just do what we are told by a cabal of creepy billionaires who are yanking the chain of ORG13. With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from [ORGANIZATION]. Ms. [PERSON]6. Mr. President, [DATE]DATE93 the [ORGANIZATION] Republicans had to cancel a vote on the healthcare bill because the number crunchers over at the [ORGANIZATION]ional [ORGANIZATION], or the [ORGANIZATION], pointed out that the Republican bill was going to take away health insurance from 22 million people and [STREET] up the costs for millions more. So [ORGANIZATION] Republicans started throwing new plans together, one after another, rolling the dice and hoping the [ORGANIZATION] would come back with a better number. Here is a quick guide to what the Republicans have tried since the last time they canceled their vote on this bill. First, there was a bill that was, basically, the same as the first version but that included a little bit more money. [ORGANIZATION] said it still knocked 22 million people off their healthcare coverage. Second, there was a bill to simply repeal the Affordable Care Act, with no replacement whatsoever. [ORGANIZATION] said that one would knock 32 million people off their healthcare. Third, there was a proposal by Senator [PERSON]DATE93 that would let insurance companies offer insurance at one price to people with no preexisting conditions and another price for anybody who had anything wrong. We dont [ORGANIZATION] S414DATE93 even have a [ORGANIZATION] score for that one because [ORGANIZATION] had trouble figuring out how many people with preexisting conditions who really needed insurance would never be able to pay for it under that bill. Why is it that the Republicans have so much trouble coming up with something--with anything--that would improve healthcare in GPE28? The problem is that the Republicans real motivation behind all these healthcare bills is not to improve healthcare. It is to give giant tax cuts to the richest families and corporations in this country. When the goal is a big tax cut, it is hard to come up with something that actually also improves peoples healthcare. The Republican healthcare bills have gone from bad to worse to embarrassing. What makes this so painful, however, is that the health-- even the survival--of real people hangs in the balance. [DATE]8, I met with families who said they hoped--they said they prayed--the [ORGANIZATION] would not pass this terrible health bill. Each of these families had a small child who had been born with complex medical needs. I met PERSON[ORGANIZATION]6, who is only 3 [DATE]0s old and has cerebral palsy. I met PERSON[ORGANIZATION]DATE93, who was born [ORGANIZATION]0 and needed multiple surgeries to help correct his medical conditions. I met [LOCATION]0, who was born with his organs growing outside his body in a protective sac. He spent [ORGANIZATION]1 at ORG26, undergoing complicated surgeries to fit his organs back inside his body. I met these children, and I have to state that all of these kids are fighters. Every one of them has endured great pain and shown courage and determination. Every one of them has needed help from Me[ORGANIZATION] for hospital bills, breathing equipment, special feeding tubes, physical therapists, speech therapists, and nurses to help train the family on how to clean a blocked IV line or how to deal with seizures. Me[ORGANIZATION] means these children get the medical care they need, and it means they can live at home instead of in an institution. It means their families dont have to go bankrupt. It is that simple. Without this help, these families would be destroyed. These children and their families are the face of Me[ORGANIZATION], and we fight [ORGANIZATION]2 to protect them. Just to be clear, PERSON[ORGANIZATION]6s mother said to me that, without the help that Me[ORGANIZATION] provided, PERSON[ORGANIZATION]6 would have died. They are good, hardworking parents with jobs and insurance, but they didnt have the millions of dollars it took to keep PERSON[ORGANIZATION]6 alive or the money to buy the equipment and support they needed to keep PERSON[ORGANIZATION]6 at home. Yes, this is about life and death, and if anyone doubts it, call PERSON[ORGANIZATION]6s mom and ask her to explain it to you. The Republican plan isnt just cruel. It is immoral, and it is not who we are as a people. We are better than that. We shouldnt even be holding this vote [PERSON]. The [PERSON] people have begged Republicans to stop. Governors from red [PERSON]s and blue [PERSON]s alike have told them that this bill will be deeply harmful. Patient groups, [ORGANIZATION], pediatricians, nurses, hospital groups, nursing homes, and the [ORGANIZATION] have all sounded the alarm, saying these bills would do irreparable damage to our health system and to families that are trying to take care of their loved ones. I urge Republicans to stop the politics. People across this country-- Democrats, Republicans, and Independents--dont want you to repeal healthcare for millions of people. Listen to those people. Listen to PERSON[ORGANIZATION]6 and PERSON[ORGANIZATION]DATE93 and [LOCATION]0. Listen to all the people who love them. I know there is a lot we could do to make healthcare more affordable in this country. I know there is a lot we could do to make our delivery system work better. We could work together and build something better for all of GPE28. But we cant even start down that path if we rip away healthcare from millions of [PERSON]s. We just cannot do this. It is wrong. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from [PERSON]. Ms. [LOCATION]2. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from [ORGANIZATION] for her good words and her advocacy. I rise to join her and my colleagues on the floor in sharing the concerns I continue to hear [LOCATION]6 in my [PERSON], whether it is just simply walking the parades, as I did in [PERSON]1, [PERSON]2, where people would come up off the sides, or, on [ORGANIZATION]3, when a family with a child with Down syndrome just came off the side of the parade and grabbed me and said we need healthcare for our son, that we cannot cut him off, that we cannot make these drastic, draconian reductions to Me[ORGANIZATION]--because he is the face for Me[ORGANIZATION]. Right now, as far as I know, we have many versions of this healthcare bill. I think I heard this version referred to as option C. I was thinking that is not really correct because we have had options A and B. Those were the two [ORGANIZATION] healthcare bills. We had options C and D, which were the two [ORGANIZATION] healthcare bills. Then we went to option E, which was back to the idea of repealing without having a replacement. Now, as far as I know, after doing A, B, C, D, and E, we are at plan F. My mom was a teacher her entire life, and I learned from her that you cannot get much lower than F, right? I think it is time to set a new course, and that is to work together for a better grade for the [PERSON] people and for a better healthcare plan, which means working across the aisle to make changes to the Affordable Care Act. The [PERSON]ns whom I have heard from do not like A, B, C, D, E, or F. On [ORGANIZATION]4, in fact, I received a letter that was signed by [LOCATION]081 different [PERSON] healthcare organizations, and it talked about these past proposals. They wrote this [ORGANIZATION] changes or amendments will not change the ultimate impact of these bills and their deep and devastating impact on [PERSON] and its citizens. What were these groups? They were pretty mainstream groups, those being the [ORGANIZATION][PERSON], our childrens hospitals, the Autism Society of [PERSON], our nursing homes, the [PERSON] Hospital Association, the [PERSON] Nurses Association, Mental Health[PERSON], our [ORGANIZATION]3, our addiction treatment professionals, and many more. As different as these groups may be in their missions and in the work they do and who belongs to them and where they live, what they have in common is that they are dedicated to taking care of the health and well-being of [PERSON]ns. They are scared about what would happen if any of these proposals--A, B, C, D, E, or F--were to pass. They have seen that the nonpartisan [ORGANIZATION]ional [ORGANIZATION] estimates that with a number of these bills, it would mean that over 20 million people, if not all of them, would lose their health insurance, that Me[ORGANIZATION] would get cut by more than DATE9300 billion, and that out-of- pocket costs would skyrocket. Deductibles for a benchmark plan could reach 13,000 by [ORGANIZATION]5. They have seen that the [ORGANIZATION]ional [ORGANIZATION] has found that a repeal bill without a replacement would be even worse, as 32 million people would lose their coverage, and premiums would double. I understand why these [PERSON] healthcare organizations are scared about these bills, but the people who are even more scared are the citizens of my [PERSON] who depend on the Affordable Care Act for their healthcare. As I said, we all knew, on [ORGANIZATION]6 it passed, that the Affordable Care Act was a beginning and not an end. You cannot pass a major piece of legislation like that without making changes over time. Unfortunately, with the exception of a few minor things, we have been, basically, blocked from making changes because we are always having thrown at us this idea of simply repealing everything and causing chaos. After the sentiment of the [PERSON] people has been made quite clear--and you do not have to look at a poll to know that all you have to do is walk down FAC0 during any parade in our [PERSON]--now is the time for us to work across the aisle and make some positive changes. What are those changes? For one, we know we must bring some certainty to the exchanges and stabilize the market. [ORGANIZATION] S4148 I see the Senator from [ORGANIZATION] here who is the former Governor of [ORGANIZATION]. She knows, along with her colleague Senator [LOCATION]3, we need to have more certainty in the marketplace. That is why we support the bill that would do that. We should vote on that bill. I also support Senators [LOCATION]4 and [LOCATION]5 legislation--[ORGANIZATION]--to reestablish a [ORGANIZATION]5 reinsurance program. This bill would lower premiums by providing support for high-cost patients. Now, the Republican legislature in my [PERSON]--both houses are Republican--joined with the Democratic Governor in our [PERSON] and passed a similar [PERSON]-based reinsurance program. I know [PERSON]4, which, by all accounts, is a red [PERSON], has passed a reinsurance program that recently got approval from this administration. [ORGANIZATION]DATE93, as Senator [LOCATION]6 knows, [ORGANIZATION] announced its plans to pursue one as well. So we can and we should come together to pursue this as one change we can make positively for the GPE74. Another is, it is long past time to do something about the rising cost of prescription drugs. I have a bill--and I see my colleague from [PERSON] here as well, Senator [LOCATION]DATE93. We have worked on this issue together on both bills, which is similar to this issue of harnessing the negotiating power of 41 million seniors who are on [ORGANIZATION]6 in order to bring drug prices down. Right now, [ORGANIZATION]6 is literally banned from negotiating on behalf of 41 million seniors. The last time I checked, the senior citizens in my [PERSON] had a lot of power, and 41 million people, especially seniors, is a lot of negotiating power. Lets harness that because it will not just help to bring drug prices down in the [ORGANIZATION]6 Program, but it will help down the line for all citizens. There is the bringing in of more competition. One [STREET] you do that is by dangling the prospect of competition from other countries. You can do it with a trigger that is based on the number of competitors you have in a certain market. You can do it based on an increase in price or you can just do it. I and Senator [LOCATION]8, who is certainly in our thoughts and prayers [ORGANIZATION]8, have long had a bill to allow [PERSON]s to bring in safe, less expensive drugs from [PERSON]5. That is very similar to that of the [PERSON]6 market. As I have often noted when I talk about this bill, we can see [PERSON]5 from our porch in [PERSON]. We can see those lower prices right across the border. When we have developed so many lifesaving drugs, when we have done the research, when we have put government money--taxpayer money--into the research, why in this country do we have the most expensive drugs in the world? I can tell you why. It is that we have not done anything about it here because, for too long, the pharmaceutical companies have been able to have their [STREET] when it comes to legislation. This is the end of that. Finally, the [PERSON] people are starting to see this as not just campaign rhetoric but as a real problem when 4 out of the top 10 best selling drugs have gone up over 100 percent in just the last 10 [DATE]0s. Here are some more ideas. Senator [LOCATION]9 and I have a bill--bipartisan, across the aisle--that would again allow the temporary importation of safe drugs that have been on the market in another country for at least 10 [DATE]0s when there is not healthy competition for that drug in this country. [PERSON]. I and Senator [ORGANIZATION]0, a Republican from [ORGANIZATION], have a bill to stop something called pay for delay, which is when big pharmaceutical companies actually pay off generic companies to keep less expensive products off the market. That is an outrage. I would challenge any Senator to vote against that. I do not think one will. That is why we need a vote, and that is a perfect example of a bipartisan bill that could be included in a package of measures that could be improvements on the Affordable Care Act. How about this one? It is the CREATES Act, which is another bipartisan bill with me, Senator [ORGANIZATION]0, Senator [ORGANIZATION]1, Senator [ORGANIZATION]2, Senator [LOCATION]9, and many others that would put a stop to tactics in which pharmaceutical companies refuse to provide samples that the generic companies need to develop new drugs. According to the [ORGANIZATION]ional [ORGANIZATION], this legislation would save taxpayers 3.5 billion, and the one I just mentioned on pay for delay would save taxpayers 2.9 billion. Why would we say to the taxpayers of this country that we will not do that, that we will not even allow it to come up for a vote? These are votes the [ORGANIZATION] should and must take. Bringing up a bill that devastates the Me[ORGANIZATION] Program or that repeals big parts of the Affordable Care Act, without having a replacement, does the opposite. It does nothing. These bills--A, B, C, D, E, or F--do nothing in terms of bringing down pharmaceutical prices. What is this really about? It is about the identical twins whom I met [ORGANIZATION]1 from [LOCATION], [PERSON]2, which is a small town--a town similar, I am sure, to the towns the Presiding Officer would find in his [PERSON] or to the towns in [ORGANIZATION] or to the towns Senator [ORGANIZATION]3 would see in [LOCATION]. This is about identical twins. One of the twins is a pitcher, and one of the twins is a catcher on their softball team. One of the twins found out, just in the [LOCATION]1, that she has juvenile diabetes. It is a very dangerous, dangerous thing to have at [ORGANIZATION]3. The other twin is perfectly healthy. Of course, the family had to go immediately to the doctor. They bought insulin, and the insulin had gone up three times what it should have in just the last few [DATE]0s. It is very difficult for them to afford now. They got the strips. They had to do all of this, and the price kept escalating. To add to everything else, now this mom is worried that one of her daughters, not two, will have a preexisting condition and be kicked off of the insurance. Think about that. They are identical twins. It could be either one. You do not know which one. Is it the catcher? Is it the pitcher? It is a lottery. If you do not have healthcare like the Affordable Care Act in [STREET], it is like a lottery. You do not know which one of them is going to be kicked off the insurance, not have insurance, and get very sick and possibly die. That is what we are talking about here. That is not what this country is about. It could happen to anyone--to anyone in this [ORGANIZATION]8, to anyone up in the [LOCATION], to anyone at home. You do not know when it is going to happen to you or your sister or your brother or your neighbor or your dad or your mom or your grandma or your grandpa. That is why we have affordable healthcare insurance. This debate is also about our seniors and our rural communities. As Senator [LOCATION]DATE93 knows, we have heard time and time again from our rural hospitals--from [LOCATION] to GPE40, to GPE41. I was up there recently, and that is what I heard about--the rural hospitals and how difficult it is going to be for them if any of these bills pass. I know it is something our Republican colleagues, all of whom are from rural [PERSON]s--Senators [ORGANIZATION]4, [ORGANIZATION]5, and [ORGANIZATION]6--have expressed real concerns about with regard to the impact of some of the proposed Me[ORGANIZATION] cuts and what they would do in their [PERSON]s. Opioids. Both the Senator from [ORGANIZATION] who is here with me [ORGANIZATION], Senator [LOCATION]6, and certainly Senator [ORGANIZATION]3 have been leaders in this area. That is why we passed the Cures Act. That is why we put a bunch of funding from the Cures Act into opioid addiction treatment. That is why we passed [ORGANIZATION] and Recovery Act on a bipartisan basis--one of the few bills that made it through [LOCATION]1. You cannot just run TV ads on it, and you cannot just put it on campaign brochures and then go out [ORGANIZATION]5 and cut Me[ORGANIZATION], which provides the treatment for 32 percent of opioid medication- assisted treatments we have in our [PERSON]. You cannot do that. You cannot give beautiful speeches and go to press conferences and then make those kinds of cuts. I know my colleagues on both sides of the aisle understand this. This is a time when we can chart a different path forward, when we can end up where we should have begun but still standing, and that is by working together to find some positive changes to the Affordable Care Act for the [ORGANIZATION] S4149 [PERSON] people. Again, I said it on [ORGANIZATION]6 it passed--it is a beginning and not an end. Lets seize this moment, open the door, and work together for the [PERSON] people. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from [PERSON]. Mr. [ORGANIZATION]DATE93. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the effort by Republicans in the majority to rip apart our healthcare system and jeopardize the protections for people with preexisting conditions and to throw millions of people off their health insurance. Now, it is deeply troubling at this point that with [TIME] until the expected vote, we dont even know which version of repeal the Republicans hope to pass. Do Republicans support [ORGANIZATION]--the bill that according to the [ORGANIZATION]ional [ORGANIZATION], would cause 22 million more [PERSON]s to become uninsured, which would [STREET] up healthcare costs and dismantle the Me[ORGANIZATION] Program? Do they support the [PERSON]DATE93 amendment, which would bring back junk insurance plans that offer virtually no protection and [STREET] up out-of-pocket costs for vital services or will they rally behind their backup option, a plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with nothing--that is, nothing--an approach that would add 32 million more [PERSON]s to the ranks of the uninsured and cause average premiums in the nongroup market to double or will it be something else entirely? We dont know. This is reckless. This is irresponsible. The [PERSON] people deserve better. Lets be clear. A vote for the motion to proceed is a vote to move forward with conceivably any one of these bills, and all of these bills are terrible. They jeopardize lifesaving care and treatment for millions of [PERSON] families, especially those with preexisting conditions. They tear apart our safety net and give tax breaks to powerful corporations. Let me remind my Republican colleagues that a vote in support of the motion to proceed will have real-world consequences for your constituents who may lose their health insurance. Perhaps these are people you have met people, many of whom may be losing sleep out of justified fear that their children or their parents, their loved ones or they themselves are at risk of losing their healthcare. I have talked to so many people in my [PERSON] about these dangerous proposals. There is [ORGANIZATION]8. [ORGANIZATION]8 is a young farmer in Greater [PERSON] whose husband and two kids relied on Me[ORGANIZATION] to access care when their farm was struggling. There is [ORGANIZATION]9, whose mom is in a nursing home and who doesnt know how she will pay for the round-the-clock care her mother needs if Me[ORGANIZATION], which covers more than 6 in 10 nursing home residents nationwide, scales back coverage. Then, this is [PERSON]0, who said that if it werent for Me[ORGANIZATION], her son [PERSON]1, who has cerebral palsy and [LOCATION], probably wouldnt be here. I met [PERSON]1. I think he is [ORGANIZATION]6 or [ORGANIZATION]DATE93. He was born [ORGANIZATION]8, in GPE43, about a pound and a half. They took him to [ORGANIZATION]9 in [LOCATION]. [LOCATION]0 said We cant handle him, so they sent him back to GPE43 to [LOCATION]1, which could. They told [PERSON]1s parents He is going to require 1 million in care [ORGANIZATION]9 to save his life. [PERSON]1 has had, I think, 3DATE93, 38 surgeries. He spoke at a meeting we had on Me[ORGANIZATION] DATE[ORGANIZATION]1 in [PERSON], and he stood--he had a walker. He had just gotten an A-minus in his first college course. He was actually, in a [STREET], the last person in the room I was worried about because his resilience--this guy, this kid is going to be amazing. I dont think he would be here if we didnt have the kind of Me[ORGANIZATION] we have and the kind of Me[ORGANIZATION] my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are talking about limiting in a [STREET] that will affect so many people I have met across my [PERSON]. This is one of those votes that will go down in history. It is one of those votes that all of us will be answering for wherever we go for the rest of our lives. The former Republican Senator from [PERSON], [PERSON]3, outlined some of the reasons Senators should not vote for this consequential legislation in an excellent [PERSON], a piece he wrote, and it was in [LOCATION]2 [ORGANIZATION]. Senator [PERSON]4--again, a Republican from [PERSON] and someone whom I talk to a lot about healthcare--wrote this piece, saying resist the bullying, dont vote for a mystery healthcare bill. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the [LOCATION]3 Senator [PERSON]4s [PERSON]. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the [LOCATION]3, as follows Former [LOCATION]4 Senator [PERSON]. Dont Vote For a Mystery Health Care Bill There will be no do-overs on this. Take it from me a no vote [ORGANIZATION]8 is the only one that will be defensible in the [DATE]0s to come. What do you do when you are a [PERSON]6 senator and the president wants you to vote for a health care bill that could radically change health care? You ask questions. You hold hearings. You understand what it would mean to your constituents. You listen to those who know the system. And when it doesnt add up, you vote against it. The [DATE]0 was [ORGANIZATION]DATE93DATE939, and I was a freshman Republican senator from [PERSON]. Inflation was driving the already high costs of health care through the roof. President [PERSON]6 wanted to use [ORGANIZATION]6 and Me[ORGANIZATION] to limit increases in hospital budgets in the face of rapidly inflating costs. Ultimately, I decided to vote against it as it would end up hurting the people of my state and was inconsistent with my beliefs. And then, after the vote, we--Democrats and Republicans--launched an effort to learn how best to change the cost curve of the entire health system by focusing on how we pay for [ORGANIZATION]6. [PERSON]4, the [ORGANIZATION] once again is set to vote on a health care bill that will radically change how people get coverage and who can afford their care. But unlike normal times, Senators, you are being asked to approve a Motion to Proceed to a vote Without knowing what will be in the bill. Without knowing what the non-partisan [ORGANIZATION]ional [ORGANIZATION] will say about the impact of major amendments and the final bill on coverage and premiums. With full knowledge that the [ORGANIZATION] parliamentarian, who rules on what can and cant be allowed in a budget bill, has said that the [ORGANIZATION] must remove provisions intended to prevent an insurance market death spiral Without knowing the details of the secret state Me[ORGANIZATION] waivers the [PERSON] administration insists will make the bill work. Without knowing how your own state budget will be impacted. Without knowing how you will defend the provisions you will only learn about later, including the payoffs and other things that will be sneaked into the bill at [TIME]. Without even knowing which bill you are being asked to vote on, what the defining amendments will be and how much time you will have when being pressed for a final vote youll be stuck with. Forever. A vote in these circumstances will rightly provoke anger and distrust unlikely to abate. Take it from me A no vote on the Motion to Proceed [ORGANIZATION]8 is the only one that will be defensible in the [DATE]0s to come. I have had my arm twisted by the best of them--presidents and [ORGANIZATION] leaders and party whips alike. I know how uncomfortable it can be. Usually, they were able to attempt a convincing argument about what is good about the bill for the country or my state. But I never would have voted for something so far reaching without knowing the answer to all the questions above. Never in all my [DATE]0s did I experience the level of bullying we see [ORGANIZATION]. It doesnt look good in [PERSON], and I suspect it doesnt look any better in your state. I know that some of you ran for office vowing to repeal the Affordable Care Act, hoping to improve coverage and decrease costs. As public opinion polls tell us, voters do not believe this bill does the job. The good news is we havent run out of time to ask questions and to work together to fix what needs fixing if we take the time to return to regular order and hold hearings. Seven [DATE]0s ago, Democrats supported a bill far from Democratic orthodoxy. It did not provide for single payer, nor [ORGANIZATION]6 for all. Not even a public option. They handed Republicans a chance to build a health system that plays to our unique strengths as a nation, not to our weaknesses. As someone whose efforts earned the support of both Presidents [PERSON]DATE93 and [PERSON]8 to reduce health care costs without leaving anyone behind, I know our party can do much better. But it should be obvious to all of you listening to your constituents that voting on this hodgepodge of mysterious bills is not the [STREET]. Because there are no do-overs. The vote for [ORGANIZATION] is likely a vote for final passage, and the [ORGANIZATION] clearly stands ready to pass the [ORGANIZATION] bill unchanged. There is no making good on all of the issues later. Once the funds for health coverage are gone, it will take new tax increases to replace them. And whats the likelihood that will happen? There will be no hiding this vote. Let me assure you, as the official scorekeeper, the [ORGANIZATION] S41[ORGANIZATION]1 [ORGANIZATION] will eventually score the entire bill, and thats what your vote will be evaluated on. For those who worry about re-election politics, I can assure you that going into a campaign confident that youve done whats best for every one of your constituents, not just for those who want to stick you with a stale slogan, is the best medicine youll ever have prescribed for you. Mr. [ORGANIZATION]DATE93. Mr. President, there arent many votes like this in a Senators career so lets just lay this out. If you support the vote [PERSON], the following are some of the specific consequences that could follow and in many cases would follow. First, it is a vote that would open debate on bills that would undermine protections for people with preexisting conditions. This could happen in one of two ways. This vote could open debate on the potential [PERSON]DATE93 amendment, which would allow insurance companies, as long as they offer ORG[ORGANIZATION]6-compliant plans on the exchanges, to also sell bare-bones, skimpy plans outside of the exchanges, with almost no consumer protections. Under this amendment, insurers would be allowed to deny coverage and charge higher rates to women, older adults, and individuals with preexisting conditions. To my Republican colleagues, I ask Do you know someone who is pregnant? Do you know someone who has diabetes? Asthma? Depression? Cancer? Multiple sclerosis? Substance use disorders? Arthritis? [PERSON]? Sleep apnea? Parkinsons? All of these people could be denied coverage under the [PERSON]DATE93 amendment, just as they were prior to the ORG[ORGANIZATION]6. The [PERSON]DATE93 amendment will also bring back DATE[ORGANIZATION]6 and [PERSON]6 limits, coverage exclusions, and more. When I was campaigning in [PERSON]DATE93, and I would go around [PERSON]-- cafes, [LOCATION]5 halls, bars--there would be a flyer up for a family who had gone bankrupt for someone who had gotten sick. This would bring back those DATE[ORGANIZATION]6 limits, those [PERSON]6 limits. Do we really want to go back to that? The [PERSON]DATE93 amendment is intended to deceive. The amendment is designed to make people think it would lower premiums since it would allow insurers to offer stripped-down plans that dont comply with the ORG[ORGANIZATION]6s consumer protections, but what it actually does is skyrocket the price of insurance for people with preexisting conditions like epilepsy, Crohns disease, and stroke, while eviscerating the quality of insurance for those who dont yet need, or know they need, such coverage. In fact, [ORGANIZATION], which is the national political advocacy and trade association of companies that sell health insurance to [PERSON]s, and [LOCATION]DATE93 have said this proposal is simply unworkable in any form and would undermine protections for those with preexisting medical conditions, increase premiums and lead to widespread terminations of coverage for people currently enrolled in the individual market. The fact is, these high-deductible, bare-bones plans are a dangerous rip-off, and many people will not even realize what garbage insurance they have until it is too late. Here is the thing. Even if the [PERSON]DATE93 amendment were removed from the bill, [ORGANIZATION] would still undermine protections for people with preexisting conditions. That is because the bill would allow, and even incentivize, [PERSON]s to waive ORG[ORGANIZATION]6 protections like the guarantee of coverage for basic essential health benefits. If you are allowed to offer plans that dont cover basic services like mental health, prescription drugs, and maternity care, then you have a backdoor channel to charge people who need those services more than those who dont. Not only that, [PERSON]s that seek waivers and end the guarantee of essential health benefits bring us right back into the world of DATE[ORGANIZATION]6 and [PERSON]6 limits--a world where your care would end not because your doctor said so but because the insurance company would stop paying for it. This could be true even for people who get their health insurance through their employer. In fact, even if you work in a [PERSON] that hasnt taken this waiver, your employer could have gotten their health insurance from a [PERSON] that had. In short, with or without the [PERSON]DATE93 amendment, [ORGANIZATION] breaks President [PERSON]s promise to protect people with preexisting conditions. Second, yes, [PERSON] is a vote to end Me[ORGANIZATION] as we know it. Me[ORGANIZATION] is a lifeline, providing health insurance and access to care for more than DATE930 million [PERSON]s. That is about one in every five [PERSON]s. It includes seniors, pregnant women, people with disabilities, families with children. Senator PERSON[ORGANIZATION]1 was right about this being a lottery. Any of us can be in an accident. Any of us can be diagnosed at any time. Any of us can have a child who is diagnosed at any time with something unexpected. [ORGANIZATION] really should be a right. I dont understand people who say I am healthy. My kids are healthy. Why should I suffer? I am the victim here. Nothing has happened to me. Why should we have a system where I am paying for people with preexisting conditions? Really? Is that the attitude my Republican colleagues are taking? Because that seems to be the logic. Me[ORGANIZATION] had been a bedrock of our healthcare system since [ORGANIZATION]DATE9365. It was and is a [ORGANIZATION]5 promise made to [PERSON]s and to all [PERSON]s over [ORGANIZATION]1 [DATE]0s ago. And most of all, Me[ORGANIZATION] works. But [ORGANIZATION] would gut it. It would end the programs coverage guarantee, leaving [PERSON]s to either roll back coverage or slash other vital programs in order to meet their citizens needs. Finally, a vote to support the motion to proceed to this bill is a vote to [STREET] up peoples total healthcare costs. The Republicans plans decrease or eliminate the ORG[ORGANIZATION]6s tax credits, which help people afford their insurance--that was part of the construct--and it dramatically hikes premiums for older [PERSON]s, although ones younger than I--I am now [ORGANIZATION]0, but from [ORGANIZATION]1 to [ORGANIZATION]2. It drives up deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs that many people have to pay in order to receive care. [PERSON]s dont like these proposals. In fact, new polling shows that only 1DATE93 percent of [PERSON]s think they and their families will be better off under the Republican plans. That is 1DATE93 percent. What [PERSON]s want is for Republicans and Democrats to work together to build on and improve the Affordable Care Act. So why do my Republican colleagues continue to push forward on these terrible bills? It doesnt have to be this [STREET]. There is another option. This body can reject the wrongheaded and ill-thought-out proposals and allow for an open, bipartisan process under regular order where we can work together and do the things the [PERSON] people actually sent us here to do-- expand coverage, lower costs, and improve care. We should have bipartisan hearings where we hear from nonpartisan expert witnesses about the challenges facing the Affordable Care Act so we can work together to fix what isnt working in the ORG[ORGANIZATION]6. What we do know from the last few [DATE]0s is that coverage matters. This is important. Coverage matters. Just having coverage matters. [ORGANIZATION] isnt really about these big, heroic emergencies. A persons health is about some of those events, but what it is really about is having coverage and getting continuous care throughout your life. Rigorous studies have shown that for every 300 to 800 adults who get coverage, 1 life is saved per [DATE]0. Research summarized by PERSON51 and his colleagues in a recent [LOCATION]8 piece finds that health coverage expansions have improved peoples access to care, improved their financial security, meaning fewer bankruptcies and medical bills sent to collections, improved chronic disease care and outcomes, improved self-reported health, and more. Overall, health insurance has been shown to help [PERSON]s live longer, healthier lives. Now is not the time to roll back our progress. I urge my Republican colleagues to think about what a vote for proceeding on this terrible legislation would mean for the [PERSON] people. [PERSON] said that politics isnt about winning it isnt about money it isnt about power it is about improving peoples lives. Our constituents sent us here to improve their lives. So I urge my Republican colleagues to vote no. Lets work together to fix what needs to be fixed in the Affordable Care Act and do all we can to [ORGANIZATION] S4151 make sure people have access to affordable, high-quality healthcare when they need it. Mr. President, I yield the floor to the Senator from [ORGANIZATION]. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from [ORGANIZATION]. Ms. [PERSON]. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from [PERSON] for his words and his advocacy on behalf of the people of his [PERSON] and all across our country. I rise [ORGANIZATION] to join my colleagues and once again speak out against the [ORGANIZATION] Republican healthcare bill and the dangerous impact it would have on the people of my home [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]s from all walks of life. [PERSON]4, [ORGANIZATION] Republicans are pressing ahead with plans that would increase health insurance costs, give [PERSON]s worse health insurance, and strip away health coverage from millions of [PERSON]s. Yet, despite statements that a vote will come [PERSON] or in a matter of [ORGANIZATION]3, [ORGANIZATION] Republican leadership will not tell even their own Members what proposal we will vote on, let alone hold a hearing on the impact of the bill. As version after version of this bill has emerged from behind closed doors, somehow each time it is even worse than the last, and every version would be devastating for people across [ORGANIZATION]. These bills would lead to higher costs for worse coverage. In fact, the nonpartisan [ORGANIZATION]ional [ORGANIZATION] has said we would see even higher deductibles than the ones we already see. This proposal would decimate the Me[ORGANIZATION] Program and end Me[ORGANIZATION] expansion. It would take coverage away from millions. The [ORGANIZATION]ional [ORGANIZATION] has projected that [DATE] and 32 million people would lose coverage, depending on which bill we vote on. We know that rising healthcare costs are squeezing hard-working people across GPE28. I have made clear to my colleagues across the aisle that I am willing to work with anyone who is serious about working together to build and improve on the Affordable Care Act, to lower costs, but unfortunately these [ORGANIZATION] Republican bills would do just the opposite. Over [ORGANIZATION]4, I have heard from people all across [ORGANIZATION]. They have shared their most personal stories, their frustrations, and their fears about what will happen if this bill becomes law. [ORGANIZATION]5, Senator [LOCATION]3 and I held an emergency hearing in GPE45 to hear from our constituents about how proposals put forward by [ORGANIZATION] Republicans would impact them. We held this emergency hearing at 2 p.m on a [ORGANIZATION]4 [TIME] in [ORGANIZATION]DATE93, with just a [ORGANIZATION]3 notice. Yet hundreds of people showed up, and more than [ORGANIZATION]1 people got up and shared their most personal stories about the importance of healthcare, of how they have benefited from the important protections provided under current law, including maternity care, prescription drug coverage, and coverage for substance use disorder services. One of those Granite [PERSON]rs was a woman named [PERSON] from GPE46, GPE4DATE93. [PERSON] told us that the Affordable Care Act has been a financial life- saver for her family. She explained to us how, when she signed up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, her premiums dropped by DATE93[ORGANIZATION]1 a month because of subsidies. As [PERSON] described it, she and her family were able to put the extra DATE93[ORGANIZATION]1 [DATE] toward childcare, food, and their mortgage. On another recent visit to Granite [PERSON] Independent Living in GPE45, a nonprofit that provides a range of assisted-living services for Granite [PERSON]rs, I also heard about the importance of Me[ORGANIZATION] from a Granite [PERSON]r named PERSON55. PERSON55 has physical disabilities and requires the assistance of personal care aides, who are paid through Me[ORGANIZATION]. They help her with [ORGANIZATION]9 tasks, such as getting up in [TIME] and getting dressed and preparing meals. PERSON55 said that without the support from Me[ORGANIZATION], she wouldnt be able to go to work, to her job, or do basic tasks, such as shopping on her own. Without Me[ORGANIZATION], she would need to burden her family in order to complete everyday, basic activities, and she wouldnt be able to go to work. PERSON55 fears that this support could be taken away under this legislation, and she is right. It could be. She said that given the cuts to Me[ORGANIZATION] and the provisions in [PERSON]Care, she wouldnt get anywhere near what I need to survive. Finally, I have heard from advocates and those in recovery from substance use disorders about how vital Me[ORGANIZATION] expansion has been in helping them get the support they need in order to get well and back on their feet. In fact, those on the front lines of this epidemic have said that Me[ORGANIZATION] expansion is the No. 1 tool we have in order to combat the heroin, fentanyl, and opioid crisis, which is the most pressing public health and safety challenge facing my [PERSON]. [PERSON], I visited [ORGANIZATION]1 in GPE48 and heard from a woman named PERSON56. At one point in her life, as a result of substance misuse disorder, PERSON56 was homeless and she had lost custody of her son. PERSON56 is now in recovery, and she works at [ORGANIZATION]2 in [LOCATION], helping others get the support they need. She said that she owes her recovery to Me[ORGANIZATION] expansion and the Affordable Care Act and that holding on to Me[ORGANIZATION] is essential because without it, many people who are in the throes of addiction would not be able to find help. PERSON56 said I just really want to emphasize the ripple effect that recovery has on the community. Its not just because Im in recovery that I can help somebody else. Everyone around me is impacted. When we talk about the recovery revolution, its about how everyone in the community is affected when someone gets into recovery. PERSON56 is right. People who can get healthcare can get healthy, and that has a tremendous ripple effect. It lifts us all. It makes us productive and strong. At the heart of all of these stories--[PERSON], PERSON55, and PERSON56-- and the stories that I hear all over my [PERSON] is the basic fact that our communities, our families, and our entire country are better off when we give more people a chance to participate, to get the support they need, to live their lives with dignity, to contribute to our economy, and to thrive. Unfortunately, if [PERSON]Care becomes law, the progress we have made will be lost, insurance costs will rise, and millions of people will lose the care that they need. I am going to continue to stand with my Democratic colleagues and fight against this legislation until we defeat it once and for all. I urge the people of [ORGANIZATION] and across our beloved United [PERSON]s of GPE28 to continue speaking out about how this legislation would impact their lives. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr. [PERSON]. The Senator from [PERSON]0. Mr. [PERSON]. Mr. President, I do not know--and I dont know if anyone knows--whether the Republican so-called healthcare legislation will pass [PERSON], whether the beginning of the debate will take [STREET] or whether it will not. I dont know that, but this I do know. The legislation being proposed--and by the [STREET], we still dont know what that legislation is. In general, what we do know is that the legislation being proposed is the cruelest, most destructive, and irresponsible piece of legislation ever brought to ORG2 in the modern history of our country. I know the media focuses on, do the Republicans have the votes, how is this Senator going to vote, how is that Senator going to vote? All of that is interesting to those of us inside the beltway. The far more important issue--which we dont discuss enough the media doesnt cover enough--is what this legislation actually would do if it were implemented. Right now, unique among major countries on [PERSON], we do not guarantee healthcare to all people as a right. The result of that is that we now have [ORGANIZATION]--before this disastrous legislation--28 million [PERSON]s who have no health insurance and even more who have high deductibles and high copayments, preventing them from getting to a doctor when they should. We have a bad situation now. It is better [ORGANIZATION] than before the Affordable Care Act was passed, when we had over [ORGANIZATION] S4152 [ORGANIZATION]1 million people without insurance, but no one suggested what we have [ORGANIZATION] is where we should be. Yet we have 28 million people uninsured. The Republican solution to this problem is to throw another 22 million people off of the health insurance that they currently have. I want the [PERSON] people to, for one moment, put themselves in the [STREET] of someone [TIME] who may be watching what we are talking about here, who has cancer, who has heart disease, who has diabetes or some other life-threatening illness. Millions of people are in that position. They are struggling for their lives right now. They are under treatment. They are thinking, what happens if this Republican bill is passed? Will I live and continue to get the treatment that I need or will I die? I think there are very few Members of the [ORGANIZATION] who have met with their constituents on this issue, who have not seen people break into tears, asking What is going to happen to me or my children or my parents? We did a teleconference townhall [DATE]DATE93 in [PERSON]0. We had some 16,000 people on the line, and a woman whose kid has a very, very serious illness called. The cost of the prescription drugs are off the chart. She asked What is going to happen to my child if this bill goes through? Do you know what? I didnt have the guts to tell her what might happen to her child. I dont want to be on the phone telling any person in [PERSON]0 or in GPE28 that their child might die because of the legislation that might proceed [PERSON]. This legislation would cut Me[ORGANIZATION] by almost 800 billion over a 10- [DATE]0 period, taking healthcare away from lower income and working-class families, including many children with special needs, kids with Down syndrome, kids who have serious emotional problems, kids whose lives now depend on Me[ORGANIZATION]. When you cut Me[ORGANIZATION] by 800 billion, many of those children will lose coverage entirely or receive significantly fewer benefits. This legislation, when we cut Me[ORGANIZATION] by 800 billion, will have a severe and dramatic impact on nursing homes all over GPE28. A lot of people dont know this, but if your mom has [PERSON] and is in a nursing home or your dad has a terminal illness and is in a nursing home, guess what Me[ORGANIZATION] pays almost two-thirds of the costs associated with nursing home care in GPE28. What happens to the people in nursing homes when you slash Me[ORGANIZATION]? How many of them will get thrown out of the nursing homes? Where do they go? Are families in GPE28, working-class families, going to be forced to make the choice of whether they take care of their parents or whether they send their kids to college? Those are the choices that working-class families may have to make if this horrific legislation gets passed. This legislation would dramatically decrease funding for the opioid and heroin epidemic that is sweeping this country, including my [PERSON] of [PERSON]0, including [PERSON]1, [PERSON]2, [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]3, and [PERSON]s all over the country that are struggling with the opioid addiction problem. The program that provides the most funding to help deal with addiction treatment and addiction prevention happens to be Me[ORGANIZATION]. What happens to our efforts to try to get a handle on this terrible, terrible epidemic sweeping our country when you make massive cuts to Me[ORGANIZATION]? I found it amusing that when Donald [PERSON] ran for President--oh, he was a great friend of the working class. He was going to stand up for the working class. Let me mention to workers all over this country who are in DATEDATE931 that if this legislation passes, your premiums are going to go up dramatically. That is one of the reasons the [ORGANIZATION] strongly opposes this legislation. If you live in [PERSON]4, for example, where I was [TIME], speaking to the [ORGANIZATION]3--in [PERSON]4, if you are 60 [DATE]0s of age and you make 40,000 DATE9, your average health insurance premiums will go up from about 4,000 DATE9 now to 8,800 per [DATE]0, more than double. If you are a 62-[DATE]0-old worker, making 40,000 DATE9--not a lot of money--how are you going to pay that? Remember, all that Donald [PERSON] said about what a great friend of the working class he was. This legislation would defund ORG21. I get a kick out of hearing my Republican friends talk about choice, freedom. Oh, my goodness, they love choice and freedom. They want the [PERSON] people to go to any [STREET] they want to go. It is all about what GPE28 is about. [DATE] women have made a choice, and the choice they have made is that they want to get their healthcare from ORG21. That choice, that freedom would be taken away from them, starting [PERSON], if this legislation is passed. When you think about insurance, you think that insurance is about covering you in your time of need. Before the Affordable Care Act was passed, many millions of the [PERSON] people could not get the health insurance they needed to address their particular healthcare crisis. If you had a heart disease, if you had breast cancer, if you had diabetes, the insurance companies would say We are in the business of making money. Why on Gods [PERSON] would we want to insure you if you had breast cancer 5 [DATE]0s ago and it is possible it might recur? That is a losing proposition for us. That is what insurance companies want to do. They are not in the business of providing healthcare. They are in the business of making money. They denied, unbelievably--think about how crazy this is they actually would deny coverage to people who had preexisting conditions. I have problems with the Affordable Care Act. It is far, far from perfect. It did end that obscenity of allowing insurance companies not to cover people who had preexisting conditions--something that is quite unbelievable. Guess what. If this legislation is passed, in all likelihood, many people in this country with preexisting conditions will not be able to get healthcare that they need at a price they can afford. We dont quite know how many of them will die. Nobody can make that prediction. I want to read for you a very interesting article that appeared from an institution called [ORGANIZATION]4. [ORGANIZATION]4 is an entity that tries to keep a check on what politicians say. They look at you and you make a statement, and they say Is this true or is this guy not telling the truth? I was on a TV program called [ORGANIZATION]5 a number of [DATE]. I said Well, you know, if this Republican legislation is passed, thousands of [PERSON]s will die. And my Republican colleagues and the rightwing media said [PERSON]0 is engaging in hyperbole. He is exaggerating. Who wants to see anybody die? I know nobody here wants to see anybody die. Of course not. No Republican does. No Democrat does. No Independent does. But we have to look at the consequences of what we do. So what [ORGANIZATION]4 did was take a look at the studies to see whether I was telling the truth. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the [ORGANIZATION]4 article be printed in the [LOCATION]3. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the [LOCATION]3, as follows From [URL], DATEDATE935 [PERSON]0 Projection of Thousands of Deaths From Lost Health Coverage Is Well-Supported By [PERSON]1 During an interview on [ORGANIZATION]6 [ORGANIZATION]5, Sen. [PERSON]0, I-[PERSON]5, didnt hold back in his criticism of Republican efforts to roll back the Affordable Care Act He said such legislative efforts will literally be deadly. What the Republican proposal in the [ORGANIZATION] does is throw 23 million [PERSON]s off of health insurance, [PERSON]2 told host [PERSON]3. What a part of [ORGANIZATION]DATE93--the scientists there--determine is when you throw 23 million people off of health insurance, people with cancer, people with heart disease, people with diabetes, thousands of people will die. [PERSON]2 continued, I wish I didnt have to say it. This is not me. This is study after study making this point. It is common sense. Even if it seems like common sense that insurance would save lives, would it be on the scale of thousands, as [PERSON]2 said? And would legitimate studies show that? studying the studies When we contacted [PERSON]2 office, spokesman [PERSON]4 cited two sources. One is the [ORGANIZATION]8 study [PERSON]2 mentioned--published on DATEDATE936 by the liberal Center for [PERSON] Progress. It was [ORGANIZATION] S4153 coauthored by a [ORGANIZATION]8 professor of social epidemiology two medical students who graduated from [ORGANIZATION]8s T.H Chan School of Public Health, and two policy specialists at the Center for [PERSON] Progress. To come up with their estimates, the authors of the [ORGANIZATION]8-Center for [PERSON] Progress report adapted the results of a peer-reviewed DATEDATE93DATE93 study of the [ORGANIZATION] state health care law--a law that was a model for the Affordable Care Act. The DATEDATE93DATE93 study was lead-authored by [ORGANIZATION]8 professor [PERSON]5. The [ORGANIZATION]8-Center for [PERSON] Progress study projected that there would be one excess death for every 830 people who lose coverage as a result of the AHCA. Using [ORGANIZATION]ional [ORGANIZATION] projections of the impact of the [ORGANIZATION] version of the bill, the authors estimated an additional 21DATE93,000 deaths over DATEDATE938, or 21,DATE9300 per [DATE]0. The second piece of evidence [PERSON]2 office cited was an [PERSON] by yet more health policy specialists who are affiliated with [ORGANIZATION]8--[PERSON]6 and [PERSON]DATE93, who are professors of public health at [ORGANIZATION]3 as well as lecturers at [ORGANIZATION]8 Medical School. The [PERSON]--published on [ORGANIZATION], well before either chambers Republican health care bill was introduced--used as its basis a different study lead-authored by [PERSON]8. This DATE80 study tracked what happened after states expanded Me[ORGANIZATION]. Adapting the findings of the DATE80 study to a scenario in which 20 million [PERSON]s lost coverage--which turned out to be lower than what the [ORGANIZATION] found for the [ORGANIZATION] bill-- [PERSON]9 and PERSONDATE930 estimated that there would be 43,[LOCATION]156 deaths DATE[ORGANIZATION]6ly due to the [LOCATION]4s health policy changes. Its worth noting, however, that both of these projections come from the ideological left. As we noted, the Center for [PERSON] Progress is a liberal think tank. And [PERSON]9 and PERSONDATE930 are founders of [ORGANIZATION]5, a group that advocates for single-payer national health insurance--a proposal that is even further to the left than the Affordable Care Act. So can [PERSON]2 assertion be supported by the peer-reviewed literature alone? What prior studies say In our previous fact-checking of this issue, we found at least seven academic papers that detected a link between securing health insurance and a decline in mortality. Heres a rundown. In DATE82, a panel of more than a dozen medical specialists convened by the federally chartered [ORGANIZATION]6 estimated that [ORGANIZATION]6,000 [PERSON]s had died in DATE83 because they were uninsured. In [LOCATION]34 [PERSON]DATE93, PERSONDATE931, a senior research associate at [ORGANIZATION]DATE93, published a paper that sought to update the [ORGANIZATION]8 study with newer data. Replicating the studys methodology, PERSONDATE932 concluded that the figure should be increased to 22,000. A DATE85 [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION] study concluded that a lack of health insurance is associated with as many as 44,DATE9389 deaths in [LOCATION], more than those caused by kidney disease. Three studies looked at state-level expansions of Me[ORGANIZATION] and in each case found significant improvements in mortality after such expansions of coverage. These include a DATE80 [LOCATION]8 study of [PERSON]6, [PERSON]DATE93, and [PERSON]8 by [ORGANIZATION]8 researchers, and a DATEDATE93DATE93 study of [ORGANIZATION] by researchers from [ORGANIZATION]8 and [ORGANIZATION]DATE93. These were the two articles that formed the basis of the analyses cited by [PERSON]2 staff. A DATEDATE93DATE93 study published by the blog of the health policy publication ORGDATE930 looked at states that, at the time, had declined to expand Me[ORGANIZATION] under the Affordable Care Act. It estimated that the 25 states studied would have collectively avoided between DATE93,000 and 1DATE93,000 deaths. A DATEDATE93DATE93 study in ORGDATE931 found improved survival rates for young adults with cancer after securing insurance under the Affordable Care Act. A DATE86 study in the journal ORGDATE932 looked at a provision of the Affordable Care Act that allows young adults to be covered under a parents policy. The study found a decline in mortality among this population from diseases amenable to preventive treatment. Mortality from trauma, such as car accidents, saw no decrease, as would be expected. We found two papers with results that were more equivocal. A paper published in [DATE] DATE85 in ORGDATE933. In it, PERSONDATE933 of ORGDATE934 at the ORGDATE935, raised questions about the conclusions of the seminal [ORGANIZATION]6 study from DATE82. PERSONDATE934 study adjusted the data--as the [ORGANIZATION]8 had not-- for a number of demographic and health factors, including status as a smoker and body mass index, and found that doing so removed the excess number of deaths found in the original study. A DATE88 paper in the [LOCATION]8 coauthored by PERSONDATE935 of [ORGANIZATION]DATE93 compared about 6,000 patients in [PERSON]9 who got coverage through a [PERSON]DATE93 Me[ORGANIZATION] expansion and about 6,000 who didnt. While the study found improvements in out-of-pocket medical spending and lower rates of depression among those who got coverage, key benchmarks for physical health--including blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar--did not improve in such patients. But even the two lead authors of the more equivocal studies have told us that the scholarly record demonstrates that having health insurance saves lives, and that not having insurance can lead to additional deaths. We asked several of the authors of these papers whether they believe [PERSON]2 assertion of thousands of deaths is generally supported by the scholarly evidence. We heard back from three of them.  Thousands is completely fair, PERSONDATE932 said. [PERSON] agreed. It is of course difficult to pin down an exact number of deaths that would be caused by a specific new policy, she said. But a number like thousands does not seem unreasonable, based on the available evidence. And [PERSON]8--whose work formed the indirect basis of the studies cited by [PERSON]2--concurred. I agree that its challenging to pin down an exact number on this, [PERSON]8 said. But overall, the academic evidence certainly gets you into the range of thousands of deaths per [DATE]0. Our ruling [PERSON]2 said, When you throw 23 million people off of health insurance--people with cancer, people with heart disease, people with diabetes--thousands of people will die. . . . This is study after study making this point. [PERSON]2 statement on [ORGANIZATION]5 was phrased generally enough to be defensible. We found ample evidence in the academic literature to suggest that legislation on the scale of the [ORGANIZATION] bill would produce thousands of additional deaths. That said, we cant say with any specificity how many deaths will occur. Its important to note that the studies provide estimates only, and each study found a slightly different result. On balance, we rate the statement [ORGANIZATION]. Mr. [PERSON]. One of the studies my office cited was published on DATEDATE936 by the Center for [PERSON] Progress. It was coauthored by a [ORGANIZATION]8 professor of social epidemiology, two medical students who graduated from [ORGANIZATION]8s T.H Chan School of Public Health, and two policy specialists at the Center for [PERSON] Progress. I wont go through all of the details, but I will say this, quoting from [ORGANIZATION]4 The [ORGANIZATION]8-Center for [PERSON] Progress study projected that there would be one excess death for every 830 people who lose coverage as a result of the AHCA. The Republican bill. Using [ORGANIZATION]ional [ORGANIZATION] projections of the impact of the [ORGANIZATION] version of the bill, the authors estimated an additional 21DATE93,000 deaths over DATEDATE938, or 21,DATE9300 per [DATE]0. That is not [PERSON]0 that is a study done at [ORGANIZATION]8. The second piece of evidence [PERSON]2 office cited was an [PERSON] by yet more health policy specialists who are affiliated with [ORGANIZATION]8--[PERSON]6 and [PERSON]DATE93, who are professors of public health at [ORGANIZATION]3 as well as lecturers at [ORGANIZATION]8 Medical School. Adapting the findings of the DATE80 study to a scenario in which 20 million [PERSON]s lost coverage--which turned out to be lower than what the [ORGANIZATION] found for the [ORGANIZATION] bill-- They estimated 23 million would lose coverage-- [PERSON]9 and PERSONDATE930 estimated that there would be 43,[LOCATION]156 deaths DATE[ORGANIZATION]6ly due to the [LOCATION]4s health policy changes. Quoting again from [ORGANIZATION]4 So can [PERSON]2 assertion be supported by the peer-reviewed literature alone? Then they cite some studies. In DATE82, a panel of more than a dozen medical specialists convened by the federally chartered [ORGANIZATION]6 estimated that [ORGANIZATION]6,000 [PERSON]s had died in the [DATE]0 DATE83 because they were uninsured. In [LOCATION]34 [PERSON]DATE93, PERSONDATE931, a senior research associate at [ORGANIZATION]DATE93, published a paper that sought to update the [ORGANIZATION]8 study with newer data. Replicating the studys methodology, PERSONDATE932 concluded that the figure should be increased to 22,000. A DATE85 [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION] study concluded that a lack of health insurance is associated with as many as 44,DATE9389 deaths in [LOCATION], more than those caused by kidney disease. And on and on it goes. This is not [PERSON]0 talking this is scientific and medical study after medical study saying what is obvious--that if you have a life-threatening disease and cannot get healthcare, you will die. So I would hope that my Republican colleagues, as they vote [PERSON], understand the consequences of their vote. I know no Republican--nobody here--wants to see anybody die, but when you take 23 million people off of the health insurance they have, many thousands of those people will die. I think most [PERSON]s would think that when you are dealing with an [ORGANIZATION] S4154 issue like healthcare, which impacts, by definition, every single person in our country, and when you are dealing with an issue that impacts about one-sixth of the [PERSON] economy--over 3 trillion DATE9--that you just might want to have some serious discussions on that issue. You might want to ask--here is a radical idea--doctors what they think about this legislation. What is it going to mean to their patients? Wow, that is a pretty radical idea when dealing with healthcare for all the [PERSON] people. You might want to have one hearing, maybe, and say to doctors Doctors, what do you think about this bill? What about hospitals? How will this bill impact hospitals, especially rural hospitals in [PERSON]0, [LOCATION]0, and all across this country? You might want to talk to a hospital administrator. You might want to talk to a patient advocate, maybe somebody from [LOCATION] or somebody who is active in the diabetes effort. You just might want to talk to the experts on healthcare as to how this legislation might impact the work they do. But, amazingly, in an unprecedented [STREET], this legislation was written behind closed doors. I think it was [LOCATION]08, 13 Republican Senators who wrote this bill. Most Republican Senators dont even know what is in this bill, let alone Democrats and let alone the [PERSON] people. How do you write legislation that impacts every [PERSON], one-sixth of the economy, and not have one public hearing to hear from those most knowledgeable about healthcare in GPE28? But that is exactly what the Republican leadership has done. I know why they did that. It is not a secret. If you had a horrific piece of legislation, trust me, you would want as little public discussion as possible. You would try to hide what this bill does. I understand that. Yet, despite all of that, it turns out that virtually every major healthcare organization in GPE28 opposes this bill. I dont know how you can go forward with legislation that has had zero public hearings, that is opposed overwhelmingly by the [PERSON] people--last poll that I saw from [LOCATION]2 had [LOCATION]08 percent support for this legislation--and go forward with legislation opposed by every major healthcare organization in GPE28. This bill is opposed by the [ORGANIZATION], the largest senior group in GPE28. It is opposed by the [PERSON] Hospital Association, [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION], the [PERSON] Heart Association, the [PERSON] Academy of Family Physicians, the [PERSON] Academy of Pediatrics, the [PERSON] Psychiatric Association, the Federation of [PERSON] Hospitals, the [ORGANIZATION]3, the [PERSON] Lung Association, [ORGANIZATION]5, [ORGANIZATION]6, [ORGANIZATION]DATE93 society and the [PERSON] Nurses Association. In other words, virtually every major healthcare organization does not want to see this bill passed. The [PERSON] people overwhelmingly do not want to see this bill passed. So how come it might pass? People dont want it. [ORGANIZATION] organizations dont want it. Who wants it? I will tell how wants it-- people who are going to get tax breaks. They think it is a great idea. Billionaires who got 200 billion in tax breaks from the [ORGANIZATION] bill think it is an extraordinary idea. So what if 23 million people lose their health insurance from the [ORGANIZATION] bill. The top one percent will get 200 billion in tax breaks. Large healthcare corporations like it. The insurance companies and the drug companies are going to get a combined hundreds of billions of dollars. I will tell you who else likes it those people associated with PERSONDATE93DATE93 brothers who are spending hundreds of millions of dollars on elections. They like it because their ideology, their philosophy is that government should play no role in the concerns of the [PERSON] people. [PERSON] my words--if this bill, which would cut Me[ORGANIZATION] by 800 billion, passes, [ORGANIZATION]6 will be next. And in the [ORGANIZATION], they have already passed legislation that would voucherize [ORGANIZATION]6. [ORGANIZATION]9 will not be far behind. That is the ideology of PERSONDATE93DATE93 brothers and the people who fund ORG13. Their concern is with large campaign contributors, not the [PERSON] people. I hope very much that [PERSON] when we assemble here--I gather in the [TIME]--for a vote, the Republicans will think more about people in their own [PERSON], about their children, the elderly, the sick, and not just about their campaign contributors. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from [LOCATION]1. Ms. [PERSON]. Mr. President, I rise [TIME] to help deliver a message from [PERSON] families to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. The [PERSON] people have sent a clear message to [PERSON]. The message is that they do not want us to go forward with this partisan--and mean--healthcare repeal bill. But, incredibly, we are [ORGANIZATION] about to embark on a vote to do the exact opposite. What is happening in [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]8 is that we are completely ignoring the message that [LOCATION]1ites and the hard-working [PERSON] families across this country have sent for us to hear. Havent you been listening? To my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, have you been listening to the calls pouring in from families in your [PERSON]s? Have you been listening to the voices of parents and their children, the schoolteachers and doctors, and the working people who are [ORGANIZATION]9 struggling to get ahead? These messages have been sent to [PERSON]. They have been sent loudly and for DATE91--in fact, for DATE91 for you to possibly not have heard them. The [PERSON] people dont want to pay more for less care. They dont want the age tax or the higher premiums this plan is offering. People with preexisting conditions dont want to be thrown into a high-risk pool or priced out of the coverage they have [ORGANIZATION]. They dont want bare-bones insurance that doesnt cover the essential services and lifesaving care they may need. They dont want their loved ones who depend on [ORGANIZATION]6 for nursing home care or their disabled children who rely on Me[ORGANIZATION] funding at school to have their care put at risk through caps and cuts. The [PERSON] people dont want a plan that will make things worse. It is hard for me to believe that [PERSON] hasnt heard this message because I have been listening. I have been listening to people like PERSON80. PERSON80 is from [LOCATION]2, [LOCATION]3. She told me that she is scared because her Crohns disease would cost her a fortune if her preexisting conditions were not covered. She told me that she needs the healthcare she has [ORGANIZATION] because my husband ruptured a disk in his back that prevented him from getting a job that promised us coverage. So now he works multiple jobs. I have been listening to PERSON81 from [LOCATION]4, [LOCATION]3. I met with PERSON81 recently, and she told me about her son PERSON82. PERSON82, at a young age, was diagnosed on the autism spectrum and was never expected to learn to even speak. When PERSON82 was DATE93, medical professionals spoke with PERSON81 and said that PERSON82 might have to be removed from his home and left to be cared for in an institution. But PERSON81 had hope, and thanks to Me[ORGANIZATION], PERSON82 was able to receive some very specialized medical therapy for his autism, and he was able to remain at home. He was able to receive an education. He was able to get his drivers license, and now PERSON82 is attending college. PERSON81 is terrified, nonetheless, that this bills drastic cuts to Me[ORGANIZATION] would rob PERSON82 of the care he needs to achieve the independence that he has worked so hard for during his entire life. PERSON81 told me about her concern for so many other families with similar situations. I have been listening to [PERSON]. [PERSON] is from [LOCATION]5, [LOCATION]3. He has no idea how he and other older [LOCATION]1ites will be able to afford higher costs for healthcare. [PERSON]s sons, both of whom have diabetes, are already struggling with skyrocketing insulin prices. I have been listening to the [PERSON] family in [LOCATION]6, [LOCATION]3. Their daughter PERSON86 was born with a congenital heart defect. She had to have open heart surgery at 5 [ORGANIZATION]3 of age. Now, PERSON86 is guaranteed coverage without being denied or charged more, but PERSON86s parents are scared that this repeal plan will make things worse. When PERSON86s mom, Chelsey [PERSON], was told about how this plan would weaken the guaranteed protections and care that people have [ORGANIZATION], she said [ORGANIZATION] S4155 this in her letter to me To me, its like theyre taking the [PERSON] Dream from her . . . kids in [LOCATION]1 with preexisting conditions . . . are counting on you to protect that right. This isnt right. This isnt fair. It is not who we are. If my colleagues who have been drafting this plan behind closed doors have not been listening to the messages of fear and anxiety from the [PERSON] people, maybe they will listen to why this proposal is very personal to me. When I was 9 [DATE]0s old, I got sick. I got really sick. I was in the hospital for 3 DATE92. Following getting out of the hospital, I required significant followup care for nearly DATE9 before I regained my full strength and fully recovered. But when it came to health insurance, it was like I had a scarlet letter. My grandparents, who raised me, couldnt find a policy that would cover me, not from any insurer and not at any price. They had to pay for my care out of pocket, and I can tell you they made some major sacrifices to do so, all because I was a child who had been branded with those terrifying words preexisting condition. So what are we doing here? It is time to stop the partisan nonsense. The people of [LOCATION]1 did not send me to [PERSON] to take away peoples healthcare. They sent me to fight for people like PERSON86, PERSON82, and PERSON80. What I hear from people in [LOCATION]1 is that they want us working together to protect the care people have and to make it more affordable. We should be working together to lower costs like skyrocketing prescription drug prices. We should be working together to strengthen the insurance market and give people more options. But we should not be working on partisan repeal legislation that will make things worse, that will leave millions uninsured, that will make healthcare more expensive, and that will price families out of the care they have [ORGANIZATION]. It is time we listened to the messages that are being sent to [PERSON]. It is time we worked together across the partisan aisle to do our jobs--the jobs the [PERSON] people sent us here to do on their behalf. I hope the congressional majority will join me and my colleagues to work together to strengthen healthcare and to move our country forward. I thank the body. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from [LOCATION]0. Mr. [PERSON]. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from [LOCATION]1 and also my colleague from [PERSON]0. Their words have been very powerful. I also rise to talk about healthcare. We are told in the [ORGANIZATION] that [PERSON] we vote, but we dont know what we will be voting on. We will bring up a [ORGANIZATION] bill that, by virtually every account, is not going to be the bill that we will be voting on, but we dont yet know which version of healthcare we will be voting on if we proceed to the debate. It is like a three-card monte game. There are all sorts of different versions that are out there on the table. One version would take health insurance away from 22 million people, one from 25 million, and one from 32 million, and we are not being told which one we will vote on. When I was a kid, there was a TV show we used to watch, Lets Make a Deal. One of the features of the show was this What is behind door No. 1, and what is behind door No. 2? The contestants would have the opportunity to pick. One would be great, and one would be a disaster. That was the fun of the game show What is behind door No. 1? What is behind door No. 2? But this isnt about a game show. We are not participating in a game show. We are participating in a decision about the most important aspect of any persons life--their health--and about the most important expenditure they ever make with a dollar--a healthcare expenditure--and about the largest sector of the [PERSON] economy--healthcare. Instead of treating the issue with the gravity it deserves, there is a secret plan and a mystery vote without any hearings, shutting out the committees, including [ORGANIZATION], where I serve, shutting out the minority party, which represents 48 of the 100 Senators in this body, and, most importantly, shutting out the public. As the Senator from [PERSON]0 mentioned, in this body, the greatest deliberative body in the world, we have not had a single hearing. We have not heard from a single doctor, a single patient, a single hospital, a single nurse, a single insurance company, or a single medical innovator. We are about to take a vote on the most important expenditure in anyones life and the largest sector in the [PERSON] economy following a completely closed process where it has been the will of the majority to keep the door shut. This isnt a game show. Let me tell you how real this is. I did something on [ORGANIZATION]4 that I often do. I started doing this in DATE82. I live in [LOCATION]7, but I [STREET] a number of hours to [LOCATION]8, [LOCATION]9, which is a county on the border between [LOCATION]0 and [PERSON]1. It is a county where my wifes family is from. She grew up in GPE70, but her dad is from GPE71, [LOCATION]9, in [LOCATION]8, right across the border from GPE72 and [PERSON] in [PERSON]1. There is a fairground in GPE73--the [LOCATION]0-[PERSON]1 fairgrounds. Back in the late [ORGANIZATION]DATE9390s, a Catholic nun, Sister PERSON90, and two other wonderful nurses who have become friends--PERSON91 and PERSON92--decided to try to offer healthcare for people who didnt have health insurance at this county fairground. They just set up with a few volunteers, and they said If you live in LOC2, if you dont have health insurance, if you need medical care or dental care, just come and we will see what we can do. They do this DATE99, for [DATE] DATE9. Here is what this has grown into. I first went when I was Lieutenant Governor in DATE82. People start to arrive. I have talked about this on the floor. I just did it [ORGANIZATION]4, and I want to share some stories. They start to arrive [ORGANIZATION] or [LOCATION]00 in cars. They camp in the campground. Now, it is [LOCATION]01, and [DATE] was [DATE] in [ORGANIZATION]DATE93. They start camping with their kids, often in cars. Some are sleeping in cars. Some are throwing blankets out on the lawn next to a chain-link fence. They wait in the tens, in the dozens, in [LOCATION]03, in the hundreds. Then they open the door at 6 a.m It is [ORGANIZATION]4 morning, and the people who have waited for [ORGANIZATION]3 come in and get a number to see if they can get healthcare on [ORGANIZATION]4, [LOCATION]04, or [LOCATION]05 from volunteer doctors in the richest GPE74 and the most compassionate GPE74 in the world. When they opened the door on [ORGANIZATION]4 morning, I was down there. I do what I do. I go and I work the registration booth, and I talk to people and register them so they can get healthcare. I got there a little late. They had opened the door at 6 a.m , and I got there 8 a.m They had already given out numbers to 1,200 people in [TIME]. Over the course of [LOCATION]06, they serve thousands of people. They come in to get dental care. For most of them, their teeth are too far gone. So it is just a matter of pulling their teeth. Some come in to have most of their teeth pulled, and then they can get dentures. They get an eye exam and find out Wow, I should have gotten glasses 5 or 10 [DATE]0s ago. No wonder I have been such a poor student all the [STREET] through school, or no wonder I have had such a hard time on my job. I needed glasses. They get a cancer screening. Sometimes they get something caught early, and sometimes they get something caught very late. It is an amazing spectacle. It is uplifting because of the volunteers who turn out--doctors, dental hygienists, nurses, and ORG90, which comes to do vision screenings. That is uplifting. It is depressing and it is heartbreaking to see people sleeping up against chain-linked fences and sleeping crunched over in their car for [ORGANIZATION]3 so that they can get a little bit of free healthcare in the richest GPE74 on [PERSON]. When I work the registration booth, I have to ask people a series of questions so that they know who they can go see when they are there. I worked the booth for [TIME]. Here is a question you ask everybody How long has it been since you have seen a doctor? How long has it been since you have seen a doctor? I had a mother of four kids. The kids were [LOCATION]08 and under, and they were sort [ORGANIZATION] S4156 of buzzing around. The mom was sitting in a chair. You know what happens if you are a mom with kids that young. Your kids pick up something in school. They bring it home, and you get sick. This is what happens to parents. I have a colleague here with young kids, and he knows what I am talking about. I asked the mother How long has it been since you have seen a doctor? I am not really sure. So I was kind of going through my checklist. Have you seen a doctor within the [LOCATION]1? No, not within the [LOCATION]1. Have you seen a doctor within the last 2 [DATE]0s? Not within the last 2 [DATE]0s. Have you seen a doctor within the last 3 [DATE]0s? I might have seen a doctor in the last 3 [DATE]0s. That was a mother of four young kids. I had somebody sitting across from me, and I asked her another common question Are you employed? You ask everybody this. Part-time? Full- time? I am not employed, but I am about to get my nursing license back. Well, that is interesting. So you are in healthcare. Well, I used to be. I am about to get my nursing license back. Well, what happened? Now, this wasnt on the questionnaire, but I couldnt resist asking her What happened? Well, I was a nurse. I had a great career. I had a great life. But then a doctor prescribed me opioids for arthritis, and the bottom fell out of my life. I got addicted to opioids, and I lost my license, and I lost virtually everything in my life. Now I am unemployed, but I am working as a counselor at a church, trying to help people who are also opioid addicted. I am about to get my license back, but I am not working yet, and I dont have insurance yet, and that is why, even though I am a nurse and I am a healthcare professional, I have waited in line for a couple of [ORGANIZATION]3 to come get healthcare. There was a woman from PERSON81land who had been laid off as a supervisor at ORG91 a number of [DATE]. She was unemployed. She had horrible dental problems that were [STREET] past being solved. She just needed to get a bunch of her teeth pulled to ease her pain. So get what this woman did. This is about an [TIME] [STREET] from her house. When her teeth got so bad and so painful after her firing and she needed to have her teeth pulled, she couldnt go anywhere. She didnt have anybody to do it. She said I think there is this free clinic in LOC2. Now, it is a couple of DATE92 out. So I am going to have to suffer through the pain for a while, but I also have to save up some money. She saved up her money like most people would try to save money for a [LOCATION]13 vacation. She saved up her money so she could put enough gas in the car and pay for [TIME] at a hotel and so she could [STREET] for [TIME] to [LOCATION]8, [LOCATION]9, and wait in the line for [ORGANIZATION]3 and come and get a bunch of her teeth pulled in the richest and most compassionate GPE74 on [PERSON]. By the [STREET], I had another guy, and I asked him the question What are you here for? Are you here for medical services, are you here for dental services or are you here for vision services? He said I am actually here for all three, but the problem is, it is [DATE] of the [DATE]0. It is [LOCATION]15 and humid, and I am so sick, I cant sit out in the LOC3 [LOCATION]16. So I got to do two out of three. I cant do all three. I said Which are the two worst, is it the medical and dental or vision and dental or vision and medical? He said Look, I will do dental and medical, but even though I have glasses and I need to get an upgrade, I cant wait around because I am so sick out in the hot LOC3 for so long. So you are just going to have to give me two out of the three. I cant wait [LOCATION]17. I cant wait [LOCATION]16 in this dusty fairground on the 21st of [LOCATION]01 to get healthcare. These people need us. They need us to be at our best. They need us to be thinking about them. The first time I went to this clinic in GPE73, I was struck by the magnanimity of the volunteers, I was struck by the need, but what really hit me was when I went into the parking lot. I expected to see cars from [LOCATION]0 and [PERSON]1 because [PERSON]1 is 10 miles away from the fairgrounds. I might have expected to see cars from [PERSON]2, which is 100 miles away, or GPE76, which is 40 miles away, but [PERSON] is 1[ORGANIZATION]1 miles away, [ORGANIZATION] is 3[ORGANIZATION]1 miles away, [ORGANIZATION] is 400 miles away, [PERSON]0 is farther, and [PERSON]1 is farther. People [STREET] from all over the [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION], in the richest nation on [PERSON], in the most compassionate GPE74 on [PERSON], to wait for [ORGANIZATION]3 in a dusty campground in the heat of the hottest part of [ORGANIZATION]DATE93 so they can have their teeth pulled because they dont have healthcare. The Affordable Care Act has cut the uninsurance rate to one of the lowest in recorded history, but we havent gone far enough. We have to do better by these people who are sleeping in their cars or up against chain-link fences, who are traveling for [TIME] to get their teeth pulled, not worse. We want to have fewer people like this and fewer folks who need to do this, not more. The vote we are going to have about whether it is 22 million or 25 million or 32 million people who lose health insurance, that is going the wrong [STREET]. We have to go a different [STREET]. We have to do better, not worse. Most of the things we talk about in this [ORGANIZATION]8 are about issues. This isnt about issues, this is about who we are. This is about who we are as Senators. This is about who we are as [PERSON]s. This is about who we are as thinking, feeling, breathing, believing human beings. It is about who we are. A great teacher, a great teacher once laid out the yardstick I was sick and you took care of me. That is one version of [ORGANIZATION]. There are other phraseologies from the 25th chapter of PERSON93 I was sick and you visited me. I was sick and you cared for me. I was sick and you looked after me. The Teacher basically says, the [STREET] you treat someone who is sick is the [STREET] you treat the Creator. It is important to be compassionate to somebody who is sick, and anybody who is hearing these words, you dont have to think for a second to think about somebody in your family who is suffering from cancer or dementia or mental illness or who has been the victim of an accident. There are faces appearing in your minds right now because we all have this in our families. The [STREET] we treat people who are sick is not just a measure of us, it is a measure of what we think about the Creator. When a great teacher said, I was sick and you took care of me, he was giving an instruction to us about the [STREET] we should behave. In [LOCATION]19, I am struck by the fact that this body has been jolted by the news about two of our colleagues, both of whom who have had cancer diagnoses. [LOCATION]20, we were shocked and saddened to hear about our colleague from [PERSON]8, Senator [LOCATION]8, who is my chairman on ORG92 who is suffering a very tough form of cancer, and cancer is going to find a match in Senator [LOCATION]8. This touches us in this body. [LOCATION]21 before, we heard about another colleague on ORG92 who sits next to me at every committee hearing, Senator PERSON94, who just announced she has kidney cancer and just underwent surgery. I was chatting on the floor with her earlier [TIME]. I dont think she would mind me saying, she is strong and she is a fighter, like Senator [LOCATION]8 is a fighter, but she is worried about it just like Senator [LOCATION]8 would be. This touches everyone. It touches the powerful, it touches the powerless. It touches the wealthy, it touches the poor. It touches men, it touches women. It touches the young, it touches the old. It touches everyone, and the [STREET] we treat people who are sick, the [STREET] we treat people who are anxious about their health is the [STREET] we treat the Creator. That is what we are taught. So lets live up to that standard. Why would we do otherwise? Why are we here? Why did we run? Why do we serve? What do people expect of us? I was sick, and you cared for me. I was sick, and you visited me. I was sick, and you looked after me. I was sick, and you took care of me. Is it that hard? Is it so important to rush it through and not have hearings and not have committees and not engage the Democrats and not listen to [ORGANIZATION] S415DATE93 the people sleeping against chain-link fences or driving [TIME] to get their teeth pulled? We cant afford to get this wrong, and the talent of the people in this body convinces me beyond a shadow of a doubt that if we take the time, we can get this right. If we can get this right, why will we not take the time to get this right? So I would plead with my colleagues, lets stand together on behalf of the sick, lets stand together on behalf of those who are counting on us. Another part of [ORGANIZATION] is the Letter of [PERSON] to the [PERSON] Because we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, we have got to do the right thing. We are surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses who want us to do the right thing, and I know we can, and I pray we will. With that Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from [PERSON]2. Mr. [PERSON]. Mr. President, I was really glad to be on the floor to hear the remarks of my great friend Senator [LOCATION]4. It is gut-check time in ORG2. The legislation we are going to consider [PERSON] would hurt a lot of people in ways I think that are very hard to fathom. One of our colleagues said I didnt come here to hurt people. Everybody came here with designs on how to make their community, their [PERSON], their GPE74 a better [STREET], and we are on the verge of taking a vote on a bill that objectively will rain a level of devastation down on this country that is really hard to fathom. I cant match Senator [LOCATION]4s eloquence talking about the personal stakes here. We take for granted the fact that as employees of ORG2, we get a health benefit that makes sure that if we do fall ill or if our children fall ill, we will not have to think about whether we have the money to be able to afford treatment, but that is not how it is for all of those families who lined up in [LOCATION]0 to receive care. That is not how it is for those who come to a similar event in [PERSON]2 that is targeted just for dental services but has a line that begins [TIME] before and is oversubscribed before the event begins [TIME]. That is not how it was for the millions of [PERSON] families who used to go bankrupt because, when faced between a choice of personal financial ruin and the death of a child or a loved one, they chose financial ruin. Until you have been faced with that choice, I dont think there is any [STREET] to understand it. It certainly is a choice no one in this [ORGANIZATION]8 will ever have to make. In [PERSON]2, the [PERSON] family made that choice. Before the Affordable Care Act was passed, in the [LOCATION]22 period of time where Mr. [PERSON] didnt have healthcare insurance, their son was diagnosed with cancer, and when he got on his new plan, it was a preexisting condition so it wasnt covered, and the [PERSON] family lost everything. They went through their savings account. They lost their house. They went bankrupt. They were one of thousands and thousands of families who made that choice. That rarely happens any longer. The number of personal bankruptcies in this country has been cut in half because of the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act hasnt made healthcare magically affordable for everyone, but it has meant that people dont have to make that choice any longer. The scope of the pain we are talking about, if any of the three versions of this bill get the vote, is really hard to fathom. Under the original version of the bill, 23 million people would lose insurance. I amended this chart when a series of changes were made at [TIME] that [ORGANIZATION] scored to reduce that number to 22 million, but this is the entire population of [PERSON]4, [PERSON]3, [PERSON]4, GPEDATE93, [PERSON]5, [PERSON]DATE93, [PERSON]6, [PERSON]7, [PERSON]8, [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]9, [LOCATION]0, [LOCATION]1 and [PERSON]2, all losing healthcare at the same time, and the majority of that happens in the first [DATE]0. So of the 22 million, 14 or 15 million of those people lose insurance next [DATE]0. The scope of that devastation--[LOCATION]08 DATE92 from now, 15 million less people having insurance, 15 million more people showing up in emergency rooms to get care--is something I dont think any of my colleagues really can get their head wrapped around. For all the times President [PERSON] said the Affordable Care Act is dead, that ORG[LOCATION]08 is in a death spiral, that is not true. It is a lie. It is a lie because the [ORGANIZATION]ional [ORGANIZATION] says the death spiral only occurs if you pass any of the versions of the legislation we are considering that if the Affordable Care Act stays in [STREET], 28 million people will not have insurance--which is far too many--but if one of these bills go into effect, at [DATE] [DATE]0s, we will have [ORGANIZATION]1 million people without insurance. A new report from [ORGANIZATION] found that the ORG[ORGANIZATION]6 markets are not collapsing despite what the White [ORGANIZATION] says--despite the lies they perpetuate. Early results from DATE86 suggest the individual market is stabilizing and insurers in this market are regaining profitability. Insurer financial results show no sign of a market collapse. That is [ORGANIZATION]s finding which mirrors the finding of [ORGANIZATION]. The collapse in our insurance market only happens if one of these bills pass, and it is not just the number of people who lose healthcare. The folks we should care most about--the people who are making just enough money so they dont qualify for [ORGANIZATION]5 programs but not enough money that they can save for retirement and pay for their kids college bills and do all the things you need to do in order to lead a respectable life--those people are going to be hurt worst by this bill. If you are a [ORGANIZATION]2-[DATE]0-old getting ready for [ORGANIZATION]6 coverage, you are making 56,000 DATE9, you are going to pay 1DATE930 percent more under this bill just in your premiums, never mind the extra money you are going to pay in copays and deductibles. The [ORGANIZATION] says that if these bills are passed, a single policyholder who purchases a plan at a 58-percent actuarial value in [ORGANIZATION]5 would have a deductible of roughly 13,000 for medical and drug expenses combined, which is absolutely unaffordable. By every metric, whether it be the amount of money that you pay or the number of people who do not have healthcare coverage, the [ORGANIZATION] answers this question Who gets hurt under the [LOCATION]4 healthcare plan? Pretty clearly, everybody, unless you are an insurance company, a drug company, or rich. If you are affluent and you can afford your own healthcare, you will be fine. If you are an insurance company or a drug company, you are going to get a big tax cut out of this. But everyone else will get hurt and get hurt really badly. I have watched my Republican friends process this information. I have watched them, largely, stay silent. The Democrats are the only people on the floor of the [ORGANIZATION] these [ORGANIZATION]3 who are talking about healthcare. Most of my Republican friends are not willing to come down and defend any of these products, but those who have been have shifted their rationale. Republicans who have been willing to come down and defend their plan concede that millions and millions of people will lose insurance, and they concede that rates will go up for most [PERSON]s. So they cling to one last value that underpins the Republicans healthcare plan. In their words, that value is freedom--the freedom not to be insured. The Republicans suggest that you should not really worry about 32 million people losing insurance because those people really did not want insurance and now they will be free not to have it. That is just not what the [ORGANIZATION] says. The [ORGANIZATION] says that millions and millions of these people who will lose insurance desperately want it they are just not going to be able to afford it. It is also not true that the bill grants that kind of freedom. Insurance is compulsory under the Republican healthcare plan just like it is under the Democratic plan. It is just compulsory in a different [STREET]. The Republican plan says that as a penalty for not having insurance, you will be banned from purchasing insurance for 6 DATE92. The Affordable Care Act says that if you do not purchase insurance, you will get a penalty on your tax form. Either [STREET], it is a penalty. Yet a new wrinkle has been thrown into this debate because [LOCATION]29 it was ruled that, in a reconciliation, the Republicans cannot include this penalty provision. Without it, the entire [ORGANIZATION] S4158 [PERSON]. [PERSON]ets would collapse. For all of the Republicans talk about the freedom not to purchase insurance, they included a requirement in their bill that people buy insurance. They know they had to because they know that without it, the entire insurance market would collapse. Why is that? If you require insurance companies to charge the same thing for sick people as for non-sick people, then you have to encourage people who are not sick to buy insurance. If you do not, folks will just wait until they are sick to buy insurance, and the only people who will have insurance will be the people who have acute conditions. That will make insurance itself unaffordable, and insurers will stop offering products, or they will jack up rates to the point that it will be totally unaffordable for everyone. In the Affordable Care Act, that is what led to the individual mandate. In the Republican healthcare bill, that is what led to this provision that locks you out of insurance for 6 DATE92. But that has been ruled veritable. That has been ruled essentially out of order under reconciliation. The Republicans are going to be faced with a choice if they are able to get on this bill. They will either remove that provision and guarantee the collapse of the entire insurance market in this country or they will have to strengthen that penalty in order for it to be allowed under reconciliation, but that will essentially rob the last rhetorical argument that the Republicans had in favor of this bill. They cannot argue that it provides more people with insurance. They cannot argue that it helps with cost. They cannot claim that it increases quality. They know that. The only thing left that they could argue is that it allows some people to go without insurance if they do not want it. In truth, their bill does not do that, and the rules of the [ORGANIZATION] are going to require that they increase that penalty even more if they want any plausible, workable version of this bill to survive. It leaves us in a [STREET] in which there is no argument to do this. It does not advance values that Republicans hold dear, like personal freedom, it does not improve peoples healthcare experiences, and it does not increase the number of people who have healthcare insurance. It really does beg the question Why are we doing this? Did anybody come to the [ORGANIZATION] with the desire to hurt this many people? If I had told my Republican colleagues 4 [DATE]0s ago that their ORG[ORGANIZATION]6 replacement plan was going to [STREET] up the number of people without insurance by 32 million and increase rates by 20 percent in [DATE]0 1, would you have believed it? No. For 6 [DATE]0s, I took my Republican colleagues at their word. I did not agree with them that we should repeal the Affordable Care Act, but at least I thought they had the same goals in mind as we did--more people having access to the healthcare system and costs being controlled for as many people as possible. It is now clear that we do not. The Republicans are about to vote on a bill that will inflict unthinkable amounts of pain on this country. Who gets hurt under the [LOCATION]4 health plan? Everybody. I said this on the floor [LOCATION]29, and I will just say it again to close--that it does not have to be this [STREET]. We have accepted for so long that healthcare is a political ping-pong ball that gets tossed from one side to the other every 5 or 10 [DATE]0s. Why is it so inconceivable that Democrats and Republicans could not sit down together and try to work out keeping the parts of the Affordable Care Act that are working and improving the parts that are not? Why couldnt the Democrats understand that the Republicans want flexibility of benefit design and give Republicans something on that if you understood that we want some certainty of these marketplaces? We do not want President [PERSON] to be able to sabotage and undermine these markets. Why cant there be a compromise and a deal there? There is still time. If this vote fails [PERSON], there is still the ability for us to come together, because in the end, there is the story Senator [LOCATION]4 told about rural [LOCATION]0. Everybody here knows that story. Everybody here knows there is enormous work still to be done, and nobody out there is believing the lies about this bill, this wonderful healthcare plan President [PERSON] is promising. Everybody in this country hates this bill. It has a 15-percent approval rate. These folks know there is virtually no one who is helped by this bill other than insurance companies, drug companies, and people who are very affluent and fortunate enough to be healthy. We do not have a communicable disease on our side of the aisle. We are not going to physically hurt you if you get in a room with us. We actually do deeply desire to improve the healthcare system. You have just got to give us a chance. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from [PERSON]9. Mr. PERSON98. Mr. President, I rise to address the Republican plan to have a vote to proceed to a healthcare bill [PERSON]. The only challenge is that we have no idea what bill we are being asked to proceed to. This is hardly the [STREET] a democratic republic operates in which the leader of the majority says We want to come to the floor with no committee deliberation, no consultation with healthcare experts, no dialogue with the public, no amendments in committee of any kind, and vote on a mystery bill. The biggest mystery to me is how it is possible that the majority of Republicans are taking seriously a plan to rip healthcare from 20 million-plus [PERSON]s in order to give fabulous giveaways to the richest among us. The bill they entertained previously would have given 33 billion to the richest 400 [PERSON]s--33 billion. I have mentioned this number before. Some journalists have quoted it as 33 million, and some citizens have said that I meant 33,000. No. It is 33 billion to the richest 400 [PERSON]s--enough funds to pay for Me[ORGANIZATION] for DATE9300,000 people. What individual would say it is moral to rip healthcare away from 20 million people in order to give tax breaks to the very richest among us? In some misguided, mysterious [STREET], something has gotten ahold of the hearts and minds of my colleagues and made them think this was some kind of good idea to do so much damage to so many. In fact, we have been having this conversation since [LOCATION]34. It was earlier [LOCATION]4, when President [PERSON] was sworn in, when the majority said We are going to come to the floor of the [ORGANIZATION], and we are going to repeal healthcare for millions of [PERSON]s in short order. Here we are [ORGANIZATION]5, and it has not happened yet--in part because when people look at the details, they start to raise questions. It took a long time for the [ORGANIZATION] to send a bill over to the [ORGANIZATION], and then the [ORGANIZATION] proceeded to work on this bill with a group of 13 secret Senators--working in a secret room, in secret meetings--with the public not allowed, with fellow Senators not allowed. They came up with a bill that looked very much like the [ORGANIZATION] bill, and we will talk more about that later. The President said in his campaign and throughout much of [LOCATION]4 You are going to have such great healthcare at a tiny fraction of the cost, and it is going to be so easy. Well, it has not been that easy. We have seen the President back a plan from the [ORGANIZATION] and invite everyone over to celebrate at the White [ORGANIZATION] and get the champagne bottles out and say how wonderful it was that the [ORGANIZATION] had passed this healthcare bill--this bill that would strip healthcare from more than 20 million [PERSON]s. Then, [LOCATION]36, someone explained to him what was in that bill, and he said Oh, well, that bill is mean and heartless. Then the secret 13 here in the [ORGANIZATION] meet, and they come out with a very similar bill. And now [PERSON] is all excited now we have a really good bill, except that in a single [DATE]0, it would do even more damage to healthcare in GPE28. Along the [STREET], the President moderated his dialogue a bit and said Who knew healthcare could be so complicated? Well, Mr. President, most of the people in GPE28 realize we have a complicated healthcare system. We have an overlapping system of six different systems of healthcare. It really is quite messy and difficult. It would be great if we could, in fact, adopt a much simpler system. And I certainly have [ORGANIZATION] S4159 been advocating for us to have a much simpler system, so just by right of being an [PERSON], you are born into this world and you have healthcare. That is the [STREET] most developed nations do it, but not here in [PERSON]. We have a great healthcare system for the very wealthy, and we have a very complicated, stressful system for everyone else. What are we going to vote on [PERSON]? I wish the majority leader would come to the floor and tell us. Will we vote on a motion to proceed to a bill that looks like--what? What can you tell us? Is it [PERSON]Care 3.0? How does it differ from [PERSON]Care 1.0 or 2.0? Will it have the [PERSON]DATE93 amendment in it for fake insurance, the provision that would do enormous damage on both ends of the insurance market, providing fake insurance policies to the young and the healthy and destabilizing healthcare and putting it into a death spiral for everyone else? Or, Mr. Majority Leader, maybe you could come and tell us if you are planning a straight repeal of the ORG[ORGANIZATION]6--a straight repeal that would raise costs and premiums even higher and not just rip healthcare from 20-plus million people, but from 30 million-plus people, a plan that would be even more devastating than the previous plan. Is that what you want us to vote to proceed to [PERSON]? I can tell you that we shouldnt be voting to proceed to any version on healthcare, something that so affects the peace of mind and the quality of life of [PERSON]s. We should be operating like a democracy, like a democratic republic--holding committee hearings, holding a conversation. This is what we did when we talked about the ORG[ORGANIZATION]6 those several [DATE]0s ago. We had more than 100 committee meetings, roundtables, and walk-throughs here in ORG2. We had the single longest markup of a healthcare bill in [ORGANIZATION] ever in the history of [LOCATION]. We had the second longest session marking up the bill in [LOCATION]. We had the entertainment of hundreds and hundreds of amendments, and we adopted over 100 Republican amendments. There was a very public, extended process, with a ton of time to go home and consult with healthcare experts and stakeholders in our own [PERSON]s and with the most important stakeholders--the citizens of [PERSON]--the men and women and sons and daughters and grandparents. How did they feel about these changes? Well, as everyone knows, President [PERSON] did call the [ORGANIZATION] bill mean and heartless, but we just keep getting bills that are meaner and more heartless. The [ORGANIZATION] bill would kick 23 million people off insurance over DATEDATE938 and 14 million just next [DATE]0. The subsequent bills dont look that different. The secret 13 here in the [ORGANIZATION] went and did their deliberations, adopted pretty much the same thing as the [ORGANIZATION], only they made it worse. That [LOCATION]40 [ORGANIZATION] bill would kick 15 million off in a single [DATE]0, rather than 14 million. And then we had the brilliant idea of a repeal-only bill, which would do even worse, kicking 1DATE93 million people off in a single [DATE]0 and 32 million off within the 10-[DATE]0 period. Then we have the bill that isnt even on here because we didnt get a [ORGANIZATION]ional [ORGANIZATION] score on it that is, the special [PERSON]DATE93 fake insurance amendment bill--the one that would say Hey, insurance companies, you can offer policies that are not worth the paper they are written on. Oh, they are very appealing. There is a health insurance policy. You only have to pay [DATE]. Isnt that great? And then the policyholder who has it, they get in a car accident, they get a broken bone, and they find out the emergency room is not covered, the x rays are not covered, the cast is not covered, the doctor is not covered. Nothing is covered. That is why it is fake insurance. That is why it costs only [DATE]. It might as well be 40 cents a month, for all we care, because it just doesnt cover anything. Then, your spouse--your wife--has the great, joyful news that you are going to have a child together, and guess what. Maternity care is not covered. Can you imagine in [LOCATION]41 not covering maternity care? Yet, before the Affordable Care Act, many, many policies in GPE28 didnt cover maternity care. Well, in addition, these brilliant plans by my colleagues would cause premiums to skyrocket. Then, we have, of course, the fact that they do diabolical things to those who have preexisting conditions. Now, let me spend a little more time on the special [PERSON]DATE93 fake insurance version of this. Yes, it gave those very cheap policies that arent worth the paper they are printed on to the young and the healthy. But then, those who are older--those who are sick or have injuries or have preexisting conditions or are concerned that they may develop difficult medical issues--they need to buy a policy that actually covers the things that one would expect, that has an essential benefits package, the same as every single policy in GPE28 [ORGANIZATION] has. But, because the young and the healthy are buying the fake policies, that means that the costs skyrocket on the policies with the essential care benefits. As a result of that, more people bail out who feel like they are not directly in danger of getting sicker or injured, and then the cost of the policy goes up even more. It is a death spiral for insurance fake insurance at one end, destruction of the insurance market at the other end. So my colleagues decided to not even share the [ORGANIZATION]ional [ORGANIZATION] analysis of that bill. It was that bad. Lets see what some folks said about this. PERSON99, senior Vice President of [ORGANIZATION] said If there were [PERSON]00 Cooking for insurance, this would be the perfect recipe for destabilizing the market and turning the marketplaces into high-risk pools. That is his comment about the [PERSON]DATE93 fake insurance plan. Lets turn to a joint letter from ORG23 [PERSON] and from [ORGANIZATION] about the [PERSON]DATE93 insurance plan, the [PERSON]DATE93 fake insurance plan. Their letter says It is simply unworkable in any form and would undermine protections for those with pre-existing medical conditions, increase premiums and lead to widespread terminations of coverage for people currently enrolled in the individual market. Or how about an article in the ORG99 by [PERSON]01, published [LOCATION]42, [LOCATION]01 14 of [LOCATION]4 The [PERSON]DATE93 amendment creates almost a textbook scenario of wide-scale adverse selection--whereby riskier and more expensive patients wind up concentrated in risk pools--and entirely undermines any tools for managing that adverse selection. That is a fancy [STREET] of talking about the death spiral in insurance for those who are not young and healthy. Then we go to the conversation that [ORGANIZATION] says is the worst option of all 1DATE93 million would lose coverage in the first [DATE]0 and 32 million by [ORGANIZATION]5 under the repeal-only plan. Next [DATE]0, in just 1 [DATE]0, premiums would skyrocket above what they might have gone to anyway by an additional 25 percent. Now, our majority leader likes to say that wouldnt actually happen because provisions in the bill dont go into effect for 2 [DATE]0s. Well, these estimates and these commentaries take that into account, because the destabilization in the marketplace begins immediately. Does anyone really think insurance companies are going to stick around the marketplace that they dont know is going to exist in 1 or 2 [DATE]0s? This repeal-and-run strategy would throw our healthcare industry into chaos. If you think it is a good plan, well, I have some beachfront property in [PERSON]8 you might want to buy. Every version of this Republican [PERSON]Care plan is worse and worse for the [PERSON] people, yet these are the options that are being put forward. The majority leader wants us to vote to proceed to this set of undesirables [PERSON], these undesirable--in fact, undesirable is just too kind of a word for these policies. These are despicable. These are destructive. These are, as the President said, mean and hard- hearted. Shouldnt we try to pursue options that will make our healthcare system work better? That is what we need to do. Lets start by nailing down the cost-sharing reduction payments, or [ORGANIZATION]s. These payments are a lifeline to more than [LOCATION]08 million low-income [PERSON]s. They lower the premiums, and they lower the deductibles. They are important sources of stability for [ORGANIZATION] S4160 insurance companies. But our President has said I am not sure I want to release these [ORGANIZATION] payments. So what happens with that? Insurance companies have to assume they are not going to get them, so they are raising their rates or perhaps bailing out of the market completely. If these [ORGANIZATION] payments are terminated, insurers may leave these exchanges altogether. For those who do stay in, the average premiums for silver plans would need to increase by [ORGANIZATION]DATE93 percent just to compensate for the loss of the [ORGANIZATION]s. Because insurance companies are like any other business, they need to know how much they are going to be paid if they provide a product, and right now, they dont know. Lets hear what some have had to say. When the insurance company ORG100 pulled out of [PERSON]3 in [LOCATION]40--[LOCATION]47--the company cited continual changes in [ORGANIZATION]5 operations, rules and guidance as the main reason for exiting the marketplace. The company also said that the individual market remains volatile and the lack of certainty of funding for cost sharing reduction subsidies . . . does not provide a sustainable path forward. Then there is [PERSON]02, the president of ORG23 [PERSON] of [PERSON], who said The biggest single reason for that rate increase is the lack of the federal funding for [ORGANIZATION] in [DATE]2. We cannot assume nor should we that the money is going to be there based on what we know [ORGANIZATION]. At another point Mr. [PERSON]03 was quoted as saying The failure of the administration and the [ORGANIZATION] to bring certainty and clarity by funding [ORGANIZATION]s has caused our company to file a 22.9 percent premium increase, rather than one that is materially lower. . . . The rate increase would be 8.8 percent if the [ORGANIZATION]s were guaranteed for [DATE]2. A single-digit increase versus more than a 20-percent increase, and they have to go with the higher increase because they dont know if the President is going to make the payments that he is obliged to make. I think a piece from the [PERSON]4 LOC3 from [LOCATION]48 describes the situation we find ourselves in best, when it says Its not the problems in the Affordable Care Act exchanges that are driving the Republican effort to repeal [PERSON]09care. Its the Republican effort to kill [PERSON]09care thats causing problems in the exchanges. President [PERSON] and the [ORGANIZATION]ional Republicans are trying to exacerbate them. He closes by saying No wonder rates are going up. This really does make clear the situation. The President wants to say the exchanges have problems so we need to repeal and run or repeal and replace. Our answer to the exchanges having problems is to [STREET] 20 million people-plus off healthcare, maybe 30 million people off healthcare. In fact, the exchanges are having problems because they are being sabotaged by President [PERSON] and our Republican colleagues first, by wiping out the reinsurance proposal, which enables companies to go into a new area and compete but only if they have insurance against getting a disproportionate share of the really sick people. That is a very logical part of an insurance plan which encourages companies to go into new markets to compete, and my colleagues sabotaged it. The cost-sharing reduction payments we just talked about, a very key part of lowering premiums and making the policies affordable so struggling, hard-working [PERSON]s can buy those policies and have lower premiums and lower deductibles, but my colleagues and President [PERSON] have sabotaged it. That is not a service to the [PERSON] people. Maybe they feel they are doing a service--to whom? To the rich who can buy insurance without any of this effort to provide insurance throughout our society. Do my colleagues really want a world in which we only have wealth care? That is healthcare that only the wealthy can buy. Do they really want to denigrate, tear down, and destroy the quality of life of millions of their constituents by pursuing this path? It was not that long ago that [PERSON]04 said The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much, it is whether we provide enough for those who have little. But in their bills, my colleagues have been saying We want to give massive tax giveaways to those who have the most by ripping healthcare away from those who are struggling, hard-working [PERSON]s. It is the opposite. It is the opposite of the belief that we are all in this together, and we want a foundation for every family to thrive. I want a foundation for every family to thrive. That means peace of mind that if your loved one gets sick, they will get the care they need. It is the peace of mind that if your loved one gets sick, they will not end up bankrupt. We are not just talking about ripping healthcare insurance away from more than 20 million people. We are talking about ripping peace of mind away from 20 million people. We are not just talking about those individuals. We are talking about undermining the rural and urban healthcare infrastructure which helps everyone. I have been out in very rural, Republican parts of my [PERSON] holding townhalls. I am hearing from those who are in clinics, and they have improved considerably. Some of them have doubled their number of employees over the last 8 [DATE]0s because of the support for healthcare clinics in the ORG[ORGANIZATION]6 and also because their uncompensated care--the number of people they were serving who couldnt pay their bills--has dropped enormously. So not only have they been able to employ a lot more people providing healthcare in the community, but they have been able to do additional things. They have been able to provide more preventive services, more mental health services, and so forth. So it has been a big win for rural GPE28, and my colleagues want to tear that down. That just doesnt make any sense at all. That is why everyone here should vote unanimously to oppose going onto a mystery healthcare bill [PERSON]. There is so much we could do together if we want to improve healthcare fix those [ORGANIZATION]s provide a fix to reinsurance proceed to have a full enrollment period rather than cutting it short retain and reinforce the individual mandates so those who have insurance are covered throughout the spectrum, from the young and healthy to those who are older provide the sort of advertising that enables people to sign up and make the signup process a lot easier than it is right now. There is so much we can do together to make our healthcare system work better. My colleagues have come to the floor [TIME] to say this really matters. Quit playing games with peoples lives, quit trying to destroy the foundation for our families to thrive, and vote no on a motion to proceed to a mystery healthcare bill [PERSON]. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from [PERSON]4. Mr. [PERSON]05. Mr. President, the [ORGANIZATION] Republicans are about to take one of the most reckless actions in [ORGANIZATION] history. They are going to vote to blow up the [PERSON] healthcare system and do I dont know what next. I want to be really clear about this. Never before has the [ORGANIZATION] voted on major legislation that would reorder one-sixth of the [PERSON] economy and impact tens of millions of [PERSON] families without even knowing what the bill does. There has been no bipartisanship. There have been no hearings. Let me just say something about hearings. This may seem like sort of a process or procedural complaint, but this very much matters. Hearings matter because it is how you get experts to tell you whether your bill is any good, whether it is smart or stupid, harmful or helpful. Hearings matter because they subject your bill and the process to public scrutiny. The media is able to report on what you are up to, and your constituents know what you are up to. So it is not a small thing to complain about no hearings. In fact, you cant be a good legislator without having hearings, and you cant be an effective legislative body without conducting public hearings. We never have major legislation without hearings, but that is exactly what they are doing, and there is one very simple reason for this. They are embarrassed by what is in this bill. It is true we dont know exactly what is in this bill. There are lots and lots of versions and lots of notions being kicked around, but we can be sure of a few things. [ORGANIZATION] S4161 First, we know this that whatever problems there are with the Affordable Care Act, this bill doesnt even bother to try to fix them. To the extent that people are worried about high deductibles, it actually increases the deductibles. To the extent that people are worried about the lack of choices on the healthcare exchanges, it doesnt even try to fix that. Second, we dont know exactly how much they are going to cut Me[ORGANIZATION], but they are going to cut Me[ORGANIZATION]. Whether it is rolling back the Me[ORGANIZATION] expansion or making these radical structural reforms, essentially block-granting Me[ORGANIZATION] to the [PERSON]s, they are going to deeply cut Me[ORGANIZATION]. This hurts people. It hurts people in nursing homes. It hurts people with drug addiction. Me[ORGANIZATION] is a program that works and delivers care for millions of [PERSON]s, and it will be slashed massively [PERSON]. We also dont know whether they are going to keep the capital gains tax cut or get rid of it. In any case, they are going to get rid of most of the revenue in the Affordable Care Act. They are cutting taxes for the very wealthy, and the [STREET] they pay for that is to cut Me[ORGANIZATION]. So under the guise of fixing the ORG[ORGANIZATION]6, they do the thing they wanted to do all along--cut taxes, cut Me[ORGANIZATION]. It has nothing to do with ORG[ORGANIZATION]6 cut taxes, cut Me[ORGANIZATION]. That is what the bill [PERSON] will do. I dont care if it is the [LOCATION]50 version. I dont care if it is BCRA. I dont care if it is a new [ORGANIZATION] version. I dont care if it is [PERSON]DATE93s. All this cuts taxes for the wealthy and cuts Me[ORGANIZATION]. That is what this legislation does. [PERSON]s are going to be hurt by this legislation people with preexisting conditions, families with a loved one struggling with opioid abuse, people in nursing homes, people who rely on Me[ORGANIZATION], people who rely on ORG21. The tens of millions of people who will lose their insurance almost instantly. That is why every single patient advocacy group, from [LOCATION] to [ORGANIZATION]6, to [ORGANIZATION], to disability groups, to the [ORGANIZATION]--everybody hates this bill. Make no mistake, they hate every version of it. It is not like there is a less harmful version. Either 22 million or 23 million or 32 million lose their healthcare. We dont have to do this to ourselves. We dont have to do this to the [PERSON] people. So there are lots of different versions of this legislation. What the leader is doing, very cleverly, is allowing people to believe that the thing they are moving to is the thing they may prefer. In other words, it is a blank canvas. It is just a motion to proceed. It is just a motion to begin debate. Make no mistake, the vote [PERSON] is to repeal the Affordable Care Act with no plan to replace it. That is what they are doing [PERSON], and they have been totally secretive because they know the moment they start talking specifics, the whole thing comes crashing down. There are core elements of this vote [PERSON] that are true no matter what. It cuts Me[ORGANIZATION] it cuts taxes for the rich it reduces patient protections it reduces the number of people who have insurance and it will all be done with no hearings, no Democrats, no experts in healthcare. This thing will be dropped on us without enough time to review it, without enough time to interact with our home [PERSON] to figure out what the impact would be. We are being asked to do one of the most reckless things any group of legislators has ever been asked to do, which is to jump off a policy cliff--a healthcare cliff, a political cliff--and eventually they are going to tell you it is going to work out. Make no mistake, the reason they cant tell you what is in the bill is the moment they do, this thing will come crashing down. What we have to do is make sure this thing comes crashing down anyway, and we have to do it for the tens of millions of [PERSON]s who depend on Me[ORGANIZATION] and the ORG[ORGANIZATION]6. We have to do it for our rural hospitals, we have to do it for people with preexisting conditions, and we have to do it for people without power, without money, without the ability to walk 200 yards from this [ORGANIZATION]8 to ORG2 doctor, the best healthcare in the world. Not only are we on the exchange--I have a [ORGANIZATION] plan so we are on the exchange, we are in ORG[ORGANIZATION]6--but also, anytime I want, if I have a headache, if I have a stomach ache, if I have something more serious, I can literally walk about 200 yards from here, go to the [ORGANIZATION] doctor, and get whatever kind of healthcare I need. I want you to understand how lucky the people who are voting on your future are and how privileged we all are in this literally gilded [STREET], when peoples lives and livelihoods and life savings are on the line [PERSON], and if I get so much as a hangnail, I get to call my staff and have them help me out. We are lucky people, and we need to think about whom we are representing. I will be fine. Every Member of this [ORGANIZATION]8 will be fine, but our job is not to take care of ourselves. Our job is to represent our constituents. This bill has earned a really historic title Most unpopular major bill in [PERSON] history. Most unpopular major bill in [PERSON] history. How that can get 20 votes, let alone 51, is beyond me. I want to make one last point. We need to kill this bill, not just because of all the harm it is going to do to the country, we need to do it for the legislative branch of the [PERSON]6 Government. We just cant make laws like this. Right now, the majority party is shortsighted because at some point Democrats are going to have the gavel. The temptation to follow this precedent being set [ORGANIZATION]8, to enact major legislation without hearings and without the other party, might destroy the [ORGANIZATION] itself. There is still time. There is still good will. We can walk back from the brink and do the right thing. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr. [PERSON]07. The Senator from [ORGANIZATION]. Mr. [PERSON]08. Mr. President, it is nice to see you here at 11 p.m on [TIME]. One of the privileges we have of being in the majority is that we get to preside over ORG2, so we can listen to all of our colleagues talk to this [LOCATION]51 body. I have been in that chair for [DATE]. I cant go to bed [TIME] without putting the record straight in this body. I dont think there is a Member of ORG2 who doesnt want GPE28 to have the best healthcare in the world. The problem is, we have a campaign of disinformation that is underway right now, and it is outrageous. I cannot let it stand. My mission [TIME], very briefly, will be to put some facts on the table, on the record, because we have a lot of innuendo right now, a lot disinformation Oh, my God, people are going to die. Let me remind everybody, we are sitting here with a healthcare system that is collapsing. There is no other [STREET] to describe it. Why are we here [TIME] at 11 p.m ? Before I get to healthcare, I want to remind the [PERSON] public of why ORG2 is open [TIME]. We also did this [LOCATION]52 because something historic is underway right now in [PERSON] and that is this For the first time in our history, the minority party has not waived a [ORGANIZATION] rule that would bypass the time requirements when confirming a nominee by the President of [LOCATION]. Because of that, we [ORGANIZATION] have confirmed only around 29 percent of this Presidents nominees. The prior President, at this very point in time, had over DATE930 percent--over DATE930 percent--almost 300 people. I think the number [ORGANIZATION] is under [ORGANIZATION]1 for this President. It wasnt until [LOCATION]53 ago that he could even have a full staff meeting. By the [STREET], who is running GPE28 [ORGANIZATION]? Holdovers from the last administration because we havent been able to confirm the new nominees. Over 200 people right now stand in line, waiting to be confirmed by this body. It is outrageous. The [PERSON] people ought to be upset. They ought to be more than upset. Lets define who is doing that. It is not the majority. The minority party is dragging their feet because it slows down everything else. Guess what doesnt get done [LOCATION]4 if we continue with this schedule. Unless we are here [TIME], as we are [TIME], we will not have time to get to taxes [LOCATION]4. We will not have time to get to what the [PERSON] people are assuming we are going to get to. Consumer confidence is at a 13-[DATE]0 high [ORGANIZATION] S4162 because they are anticipating that we are going to clean up some of this mess. Let me quickly move on to healthcare and put a few facts on the record [TIME] before we close. There are five healthcare systems in GPE28. We forget this. We talk only about ORG[LOCATION]08 right now, but there are five healthcare systems in GPE28. First, we have group policies. This is where almost the majority--the vast majority are in this. Anyone who works in a company or in a large organization has a group policy. Then there is the individual market. The individual market is what ORG[LOCATION]08 addresses. It is only 13 percent of the entire healthcare system. Then there is the [LOCATION]9. Then there are [ORGANIZATION]6 and Me[ORGANIZATION]. There are five different systems of healthcare in [LOCATION]. What we are dealing with is the individual market and Me[ORGANIZATION]--mostly the individual market. Let me try to describe the situation as we see it [ORGANIZATION]. In [PERSON]DATE93, before the ORG[ORGANIZATION]6, there were 48 million people in GPE28 who did not have insurance. That is a catastrophe by anyones measure. In the richest country in the history of the world, we had 48 million people who did not have insurance. You could be precluded from having insurance because of a preexisting condition. You could lose your insurance. You couldnt transfer across [PERSON] lines. If you changed companies, even in group policies, you could be denied coverage under the next employers policy. There were real problems. Both sides had responsibility for that, but [ORGANIZATION] after the ORG[ORGANIZATION]6, 28 million people, as we stand here [TIME], still do not have insurance in GPE28--28 million. Of the 20 million who got it, 16 got it only because of the expansion of Me[ORGANIZATION], not because of ORG[LOCATION]08s work in the individual market 16 million got it because of the expansion of Me[ORGANIZATION]. All that was, was bribery from the [ORGANIZATION]5 Government to certain [PERSON]s that decided to take the money and run. They didnt do their citizens a full justice. What we see of the remaining 4 million of the 20 million who got insurance during ORG[LOCATION]08--remember, 16 million got it because of the expansion of Me[ORGANIZATION] of the remaining 4 million, 2 million are like my wife and me. Do you remember [ORGANIZATION]6 when President [PERSON]09 said that if you like your insurance, you can keep your insurance and if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor? Like most Democrats in the [ORGANIZATION] and the [ORGANIZATION] who voted on ORG[LOCATION]08 without reading it, he obviously didnt know what was in the bill because neither of those things were true. I was canceled. In an individual policy before I ran for ORG2, my individual policy as a retiree was canceled, and the only policy we could get under the exchange in ORG[LOCATION]08 included things like vision, hearing, drug rehabilitation. I have never had a problem with that. My wife hasnt either. By the [STREET], maternity--I met my wife in first grade. We are not having babies at this age. What is that? My rate is almost double because we had to take things in policies that we did not need. Of the remaining 2 million, 1 million are the most destitute, low- income people who really do need our help, but we have disrupted the entire healthcare system because the Democrats thought that the bigger government approach would work. How has that worked out in places like the [LOCATION]9? I hear talk now about single payer I will get to that in a second. If you like the [LOCATION]9, you are going to love a single-payer system because that is exactly what it is. Let me go on. I have heard a lot of talk in this [ORGANIZATION]8 [TIME] about, oh my God, the Republicans are going to hurt people in GPE28-- hurt people in GPE28. Let me talk about who is hurting people in GPE28 [ORGANIZATION]. This is a travesty in itself. We cannot get the information from the [ORGANIZATION]. We have just now gotten the information from the [ORGANIZATION]. In DATEDATE93DATE93, the [ORGANIZATION], under the rules of ORG[LOCATION]08, fined 8 million people 1.8 billion. Mr. President, I dont know about you, but I am outraged. I know you are too. The irony of that is that 85 percent of the people who were fined in DATEDATE93DATE93--1.8 billion--85 percent made less than [ORGANIZATION]1,000, and less than half of them made 25,000. What our Democratic friends did was cram down the throats of [PERSON]s this thing called ORG[LOCATION]08, and then they put fines on people who couldnt afford insurance, and they are the poorest people in our country. Who is standing for those guys [ORGANIZATION]--the Democrats? Dont you bet. They want a [ORGANIZATION] solution that gives them more power, and they could not care less about the very poor people they claim to champion. I have had enough of it. This is outrageous. Twenty-two million people are going to lose insurance. That is what they tell us. Lets clean this up right now. The [ORGANIZATION]s own estimate says that once you remove the mandate--forget about what else is available. If you just remove the mandate, because the policies are so expensive, 15 million are going to give it up. That is happening [ORGANIZATION]. By the [STREET], do you know that [ORGANIZATION] is using a [LOCATION]55 baseline to compare these numbers to? It is outrageous. In business, you would never accept this. Yet [ORGANIZATION] they are determined to be the holy grail up here. I havent seen a number come out of the [ORGANIZATION] that I would depend on yet. In fact, in [DATE]4, they overestimated the number of people who would sign up for ORG[LOCATION]08 by [LOCATION]08 million people. They missed the estimate by more than [ORGANIZATION]1 percent. This isnt a rounding error. They dont know what they are doing. Right now, [ORGANIZATION], we have the same problem. Fifteen million people say they will give up their insurance voluntarily because it is too expensive. That has nothing to do with the new plan. That is because ORG[LOCATION]08 is too expensive. They also say that 4 million people will give up Me[ORGANIZATION]. Me[ORGANIZATION] is free. Why would somebody give up Me[ORGANIZATION]? They say ORG[LOCATION]08 is so good and so affordable that they are going to add 5 million people to it. There is no evidence [ORGANIZATION] that would back that claim up. That is not a quantified model outcome. It is the estimate of a person who sits over there and makes this up. The other side is acting like, oh my goodness, this is the holy grail. Lets talk about this. The premiums under ORG[LOCATION]08 prior to [LOCATION]4, over the last 2 [DATE]0s, are up over 105 percent in GPE28. They say that the reason premiums are going up is because of uncertainty coming out of the White [ORGANIZATION]. This [DATE]0s rates were determined [LOCATION]1, before we even knew this President was going to be a nominee. That is more disinformation. What I am fed up with is that it sounds like a good story until you see the facts. The premiums in my [PERSON] alone going into next [DATE]0 are going up 42 percent. Here is the untold truth In my [PERSON], 96 of 159 counties have only one carrier. That is a monopoly. They can do pretty much whatever they want. That is under ORG[LOCATION]08, not anything else we are talking about. That is the reality [ORGANIZATION]. By the [STREET], here is the real comeuppance. [LOCATION]58 in my [PERSON]--and you have the same problem in your [PERSON]--300,000 people who make less than the poverty rate in my [PERSON] cannot get insurance [ORGANIZATION] under ORG[LOCATION]08. Forget about what we are talking about to fix this mess. [LOCATION]58 under ORG[LOCATION]08, they cant get insurance--300,000 people in my [PERSON]. That is true in every [PERSON] in our country. That is the untold ugliness of ORG[LOCATION]08. ORG[LOCATION]08 is hurting people right now. I am tired of hearing the other side talk about how they care for people--they care for people-- and then they fine the poorest people in GPE28 1.8 billion. Then they deny 300,000 people in my [PERSON] access to healthcare. Enough already. What are we doing about it? Six [DATE], this President said that there were four objectives that any healthcare system in GPE28 and the individual market had to meet. The first was access. We have already talked about how ORG[LOCATION]08 is failing people who need access to it. The lowest income people in GPE28 are being denied insurance under ORG[LOCATION]08. We fixed that. People who want insurance are going to get insurance. By the [STREET], premiums were the second thing we had to do to try to get costs down because it is becoming too [ORGANIZATION] S4163 prohibitive. I have sons in the middle of their careers. They cant really afford the insurance they are being offered [ORGANIZATION]. I feel it firsthand in my own life. Premiums right now, though--if we put into [STREET] the suggestions we have on the table right now, [ORGANIZATION]0 has estimated just [LOCATION]29 with a very credible model that rates could come down as much as DATE938 percent in the next 4 [DATE]0s. Has anybody heard the other side remind us of that data point? No. Why do those rates come down? Because the free-market system gets to act again, instead of being shackled in choices being removed. All of a sudden, now we move into it. By the [STREET], they talk about these made-up fantasy policies. Wait a minute. I had one of those made-up fantasy policies that you cant get [ORGANIZATION] under ORG[LOCATION]08. It is called catastrophic coverage. For some people with a high deductible, catastrophic coverage--that works. They are denied that [ORGANIZATION] because [ORGANIZATION] knows more about what you need in your personal life. The third thing we had to do--and this was very important. The second part of this problem is that Me[ORGANIZATION] was not on a sustainable path. I am sorry. They have overpromised, and they cannot deliver. There is no [STREET] over [DATE] [DATE]0s that we can sustain Me[ORGANIZATION]. Just as [ORGANIZATION]6 and [ORGANIZATION]9 are going bankrupt, we cannot afford to do what they are promising people we are going to do. They know that. They already know that. Just like [ORGANIZATION]1, these [ORGANIZATION] programs that they promise all the time are going to work have never worked. [ORGANIZATION]2, the War on Poverty was going to remove poverty from GPE28. I remember that. I sit at a desk where that bill was signed by the then-Democratic leader of the [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]10, before it went to the White [ORGANIZATION]. I am reminded [ORGANIZATION]2 of how [ORGANIZATION] has failed the [PERSON] people. That war on poverty has spent trillions of dollars trying to reduce poverty in GPE28. Yet, [ORGANIZATION], the poverty rate is fundamentally the same as it was in [ORGANIZATION]DATE9365 when that was signed into law. [ORGANIZATION] does not work in situations like this. I lived under a single payer. My son lived under a single payer. This is the alternative they are after. I have heard it mentioned three times on the floor of the [ORGANIZATION] [TIME]. We cannot go there. It bifurcates delivery. It would add 3.2 trillion. That is more than we spend on all of our mandatory expenses [ORGANIZATION]--3.2 trillion every single [DATE]0. That is impossible. If you think that would work, imagine this. Go home and look at your tax bill. Whatever you paid the [ORGANIZATION]5 Government [LOCATION]1, double it. That is what that would mean. It is not workable. The fourth thing we had to do was make sure preexisting conditions were protected. I worried about that through my entire career. If I changed jobs, if I had been sick or my family had been sick, I might have been denied insurance. We cant allow that. This bill doesnt allow that. We protected preexisting conditions. We put Me[ORGANIZATION] on a sustainable path for the long term. We also bring premiums down. That was a major priority here. And we give everybody in GPE28 access to healthcare--period, end of the conversation. That is not good enough. The other side is not going to be happy until this [ORGANIZATION]5 Government steps in and takes over [ORGANIZATION]6 percent of our economy called healthcare. They tried to do it in [ORGANIZATION]DATE9392 to [ORGANIZATION]DATE9394, under [ORGANIZATION]. They tried to do it here. I remember the Speaker of the [ORGANIZATION] saying If you want to know what is in this bill, you have to vote for the bill. We are not doing that [ORGANIZATION]. This cloud of innuendo that the other side has perpetrated on the [PERSON] people is just not true. In [DATE]4, not one Republican voted for ORG[LOCATION]08. Not one amendment got to the floor of this [ORGANIZATION]. Yet they want to talk about this great open policy. They had DATE93 [DATE]0s to fix this mess. People in my [PERSON] have been hurt by it. It is unforgivable, and we can do something about it [ORGANIZATION]8. Senator John [LOCATION]8 is very sick. He is a fighter. He will take care of this. I hope he will be back [ORGANIZATION]8 to help us. If he can, I think he will. We are going to vote on it [ORGANIZATION]8. We have to do this for the [PERSON] people. I want to remind everybody what is at stake here. If we dont pass this [PERSON], then we end up moving toward a single-payer system. Let me remind everybody of the other [ORGANIZATION] failures we talk about the [LOCATION]9 and [ORGANIZATION]4. [ORGANIZATION]5 and [ORGANIZATION]6 are bankrupt. We talk about the ORG[LOCATION]08 failures. Then there is [ORGANIZATION]1 of rural poverty. I want to remind everybody. Let me close with this. I heard [TIME] that this is a reckless action, the new policy. I heard [ORGANIZATION] examples about how to take care of your brethren. It is shocking to me that somebody on the other side would say that when they know these statistics of what they have done--8 million of the poorest people in GPE28 have been fined 1.8 billion. Half of them make under 25,000 DATE9. That is taking care of your brethren all right. I am embarrassed. We can fix that. I believe we heard the rain of devastation No one is helped by this bill it is a reckless act. Here is the one I love We want to work with you. We want to work with you to help fix this thing. Just DATE9 ago, I didnt hear any speeches in here--I dont think you did from that [PERSON]--where anybody on that side acknowledged that there was anything wrong with ORG[LOCATION]08. You hear [ORGANIZATION] We want to work with you to help fix ORG[LOCATION]08. It is DATE93 [DATE]0s too late, in my opinion. It would have been nice to have been included in the conversation in DATE85 and [DATE]4 when it was crammed down the throats of Republicans. I believe this is a historic moment in GPE28, not just for healthcare. [ORGANIZATION] is very important, but it is bigger than that. This is about the direction of our country. Are we going to try to trust [ORGANIZATION] again and again until we cant afford it? We are already well down that rabbit hole. We cannot afford this chance again. We have already proven it doesnt work. I hope that [ORGANIZATION]8 colleagues on our side will get together and we will vote this thing in. I welcome any Democratic support as well.

baltimore,2015-07-16T00:00:00Z,The American Prospect Blogs,Baltimore City Paper,affordable housing,[ORGANIZATION] in the Nation's Capital,"Before the doors opened, attendees gathered in a hot and crowded hallway, next to tables displaying books curated to [TIME]s guests an oral history of punk, a [ORGANIZATION] biography, a chronology of the riot-grrrl movement. When the doors finally opened, parents with children on their shoulders and teenagers with dyed-blue hair and safety-pinned jackets filed past librarians who stamped their hands with WITHDRAWN.ltnlgt [PERSON] joke, one of them said with a smirk.ltnlgt DATE0, [ORGANIZATION] had played to sold-out crowd at one of the [ORGANIZATION] top music venues, [ORGANIZATION], where the price of admission was [DATE]. But the show in the ORG58 basement was free and for all ages. It was a celebration of the ORG58s newly created ORG2, a project meant to document, save, and catalog the citys punk and hardcore history and [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION] were two other local bands, [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]. Many of the performers, like the three high-school girls comprising [PERSON], werent old enough to have seen the bands celebrated by the ORG2bands like ORG6, ORG7, [ORGANIZATION], and [ORGANIZATION] that thrived during the [ORGANIZATION] punk heyday, which began in [LOCATION] and continued into to DATE2 The flyer for the [ORGANIZATION] basement show in [LOCATION] about a half-mile from FAC1, the [ORGANIZATION] is a modernist, glass-and-steel structure that looms large among the downtown office buildings housing lobbyists and special-interest groups.ltnlgt If it seems surprising that such a strait-laced city has long been a hotbed of a stripped-down, confrontational genre of music, consider the logic of it Where better to nurture a political, anti-authority art form than the home of that authority?ltnlgt That a public ORG58 is the latest institution to commemorate a genre centered on fighting the establishment might also be counterintuitive, but the sense of [PERSON] past punk glory is strong and for many it is an inextricable part of local culture. [PERSON] have seen a number of documentary films and projects memorializing the [ORGANIZATION] punk scene. But the rash of recent reminiscence has prompted some to meditate on the timing Perhaps its pure coincidence, or perhaps [PERSON] is just the typical time lapse before nostalgia sets in.ltnlgt Or perhaps, for a city that has undergone massive changes in [ORGANIZATION] development, skyrocketing cost of living, neighborhood gentrification, and demographic shiftsthe reason for the current retrospective is not simply to document the music its to document the [STREET] the city used to be. The hope for those active in [PERSON] music scene is that despite all the change and all the looking back, art here can still take on its own meaning and propel change.ltnlgt ltnlgt ltnlgtltnlgt [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION] performed a free show in the basement of [PERSON] central public ORG58. [PERSON], they had opened for [ORGANIZATION]0 at the citys famous [ORGANIZATION]1. In this photo is bassist [PERSON] left and singer [PERSON]. Other members of the band include drummer PERSON4 and guitarist [PERSON] the first such collection of local music. [ORGANIZATION]2 houses a vernacular music archive2 that includes punk items, and also features folk music and go-go[PERSON] homegrown fusion of funk, jazz, R...and hip-hop. Academic institutions across the country preserve local art and music, and [ORGANIZATION], special collections librarian and curator of the ORG2, cites [ORGANIZATION]4 as another example. It is a testament, though, to the tremendous impact GPE4, [PERSON] scene has had on the genre that the ORG2 was recently awarded a [TIME] segment on the ORGDATE22, which included footage from the first basement show in [LOCATION], featuring the feminist punk band [PERSON]9.ltnlgt Im constantly, constantly amazed at how much great local music is being produced here, she said. We dont just mean [ORGANIZATION] or ORG7its much more expansive. [ORGANIZATION]7 hopes that eventually the archive will feature other aspects of the [ORGANIZATION] music culture, specifically go-go and jazz.ltnlgt PERSON8 of the band [ORGANIZATION]8 and the [ORGANIZATION]9, which played the ORG58 basement in DATE9, is all for that. Just because [PERSON] punk was the dominant white-kid form of expression at the time, it doesnt mean there was a space for me or others like me, said [ORGANIZATION]. However, for better or worse, we are an extension of that punk and hardcore scene, having grown up steeped in it and the [ORGANIZATION] ethos of this town. But in no [STREET] is that all we are. Plus theres a whole other rich vein of [PERSON] music that gets ignored.ltnlgt The ORG2s intention of including other aspects of the [ORGANIZATION] musical heritage, from go-go to [PERSON] as [PERSON] was known is widely supported. [PERSON] is not known as a cultural capital, PERSON10, historian of the punk scene and community activist, told me. Part of the blindness to [PERSON] cultural richness is racism. The importance of that history should not be underestimated.ltnlgt In the third-floor special collections section of the ORG21 ORG58, [ORGANIZATION]7 showed me the corner where all the punk artifacts are being stored. I asked to see the collection of riot-grrrl [ORGANIZATION], and she pulled down a box filled with neat stacks of the black-and-white books from [LOCATION]0, made on photocopiers. I carefully thumbed through the pages of defiantly feminist poetry, essays, and art. [ORGANIZATION]7 moved to a table where posters were layered between clear plastic. Many of them were for shows featuring the band ORG22, who were active during the [LOCATION]1 and 80s.ltnlgt A shorter-term goal of [ORGANIZATION]7s is to create and online portal with PDFs of the punk posters and zines, streaming music, and links to other archives. Guests to the collection will also be able to listen to donated cassettes and vinyl LPs. Its telling a story with context, she explained. The archival material will bring the descriptive content to life.ltnlgt In addition to all the fans who contributed their mementos to the archive, [ORGANIZATION]7 has a roster of dozens of volunteers anxious to donate their time to building websites or cataloging content.ltnlgt A wealth of archival material came when [ORGANIZATION]7 got in touch with filmmaker PERSON11, a connection that helped catalyze the archive project she said ORG58 staff had been discussing for [LOCATION]2. During the course of creating the forthcoming documentary [ORGANIZATION]0 [ORGANIZATION] from GPE4, [PERSON]7, PERSON12 and co-filmmaker PERSON13 compiled a wealth of historical material, ranging from rare photographs and posters to more than a mile of Super-8 footage.ltnlgtltnlgt [PERSON] PERSON14 and his band [PERSON] at [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION]3. PERSONDATE22 music career has included multiple GPE4, [PERSON]-based bands, including ORG[DATE] and [ORGANIZATION].ltnlgtltnlgtltnlgtThe workspace for the [ORGANIZATION]0 the [LOCATION] documentary is in a [DATE] building the [PERSON] neighborhood. [ORGANIZATION]7 lives in the same building, and had helped the filmmakers secure their space. Just a couple blocks away is the building that was once the fabled [PERSON] house not to be confused with [PERSON], a nearby bar. By varying descriptions, [PERSON] was in [LOCATION] an art space, a collective, a music venue, and a punk squatters paradise.ltnlgt The heart of PERSON12 and PERSON16 film is rare footage of early [PERSON] shows, filmed long before the neighborhood of [PERSON] was transformed into [TIME]life mecca it is now. Its a really symbolic [STREET] where the old passes into the new, PERSON12 said.ltnlgt Sitting in front of the large computer monitor in his studio, PERSON12 scrolled past grainy Super-8 footage of an early ORG6 show and hit play on an interview with PERSON17 of [ORGANIZATION]. This is the soundtrack to [LOCATION]4, basically, PERSON12 said.ltnlgt Doing things here takes on a new meaning, of fighting the power, PERSON12 said of the punk scene in the nations capital. It created a charged atmosphere, where you had to take a stand for who you were and what you believed. It has meaning beyond the [ORGANIZATION] nearing completion, according to PERSON12, [ORGANIZATION]0 the [LOCATION] will be the latest in a spate of films devoted to the [ORGANIZATION] scene and its history. Theres Salad Days A Decade of [ORGANIZATION]0 in GPE4, [PERSON] DATEDATE22, and Positive Force More Than a Witness9, about the punk activist organization of the same name. Then theres [LOCATION]6 [PERSON] episode10 of PERSON18 ORG28 series, [PERSON], and the upcoming documentary about [PERSON] of ORG6, called Finding [PERSON] I hope it is more than nostalgia, because nostalgia is kind of a totally anti-punk thing, PERSON19 said in an [LOCATION] appearance12 on ORG29. [ORGANIZATION]0 is about now.ltnlgtltnlgtltnlgt [ORGANIZATION] and the [ORGANIZATION]1 perform in the basement of GPE4, [PERSON] central ORG58 in DATE9. The ongoing series of shows in in support of the ORG58s ORG2.ltnlgtltnlgtltnlgtPERSON42 is the author of and contributor to several books, including [ORGANIZATION] of Days Two Decades of [ORGANIZATION]0 in the Nations [LOCATION]. A co-founder of Positive Force [PERSON], which has been organizing benefit shows and raising money in the GPE6 for [LOCATION]7, he has been active in the citys punk community since he moved here in [LOCATION]8. [LOCATION]9 he co-directs [ORGANIZATION]4, a senior outreach program, embracing what he calls a punk approach to community activism.ltnlgt The [PERSON] punk scene was always about growth and community, he told me DATE20. That sense of collectivity is what artists like PERSON12 are trying to capture, and its almost palpable even for artists as young as [PERSON]1, one of the members of [PERSON], who played the basement show in DATE21 with [ORGANIZATION].ltnlgt [PERSON]2, DATE22, is a member of the vinyl club at [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]5, which was formed when she was a student there. She has been taking guitar lessons for DATE23 from musician [PERSON]3 of [ORGANIZATION]6, [ORGANIZATION]7, and, now, [PERSON]4, who helped connect her six DATE23 ago with the two other members of [PERSON], PERSON[DATE] and [PERSON]6. She now attends [PERSON]2 High School in Northwest [PERSON]the same high school that [PERSON]7 attended. [PERSON]8, of [ORGANIZATION], ORG7, and co-founder of [ORGANIZATION]9, is arguably the most revered figurehead of local punk.ltnlgt For [PERSON]1, punk is still important because the issues the members of ORG7 wrote aboutwar, commercialism and capitalism, racism and sexismhavent gone away. [ORGANIZATION]0 influences how I thinkyou learn from it, she said. I think that what a lot of punk songs have in common is that theyre saying something.ltnlgt Growing up here, [PERSON]2 explained, my parents were always playing ORG7 and go-go bands. You definitely get a reminder and a sense of what it was like.ltnlgt But what it was like [DATE] is very different than it is now. As rent goes up and as noisy rehearsals and performances become less acceptable in gentrified neighborhoods, the documentaries and archive projects are a reminder of what it used to be like in the city that nurtured bands like ORG7 and gave rise to independent record labels like [PERSON]0. But that doesnt mean that [PERSON]1 fusillade of social commentary has ended it just looks and sounds a bit different than it has in the past, as the genre widens to embrace more groups and new messages. And when it comes to showing how the city has changed, [PERSON]1 singers are yelling about it.ltnlgt ltnlgtltnlgt [PERSON] [PERSON] in the front hall of the Martin Luther King Jr. [INSTITUTION] in GPE4, [PERSON], in [LOCATION]3. The show was part of [ORGANIZATION] in the Library series.ltnlgtltnlgtltnlgtWHILE THE CITY SEEMS to have a hard time letting go of the past, the lines defining what is punk, never well-defined, have become blurrier. Though most articles on [ORGANIZATION]DATE22 insist on describing the band as punk, [PERSON], the bands singer, remains skeptical of the word, saying its more important for the band to have a clear vision of what its members value, and to make art about that. Perhaps thats because even bands as popular as [ORGANIZATION] have a hard time avoiding [LOCATION] that mention17 [PERSON]7 or [ORGANIZATION], no matter how different their sound.ltnlgt I do think its important to write your own history, [PERSON]0 told me. But the only reason to spend time looking backward is to understand where youre going, to look forward. I just dont want to be interviewed a million times about ORG7 and other bands when Im pouring myself into my own music right now.ltnlgt [PERSON] is really good at mythologizing its punk and hardcore past, said [PERSON]2 [ORGANIZATION] of [ORGANIZATION] and the [ORGANIZATION]1. The members of [ORGANIZATION] decline to use their government names. But lets not forget that as radical as it purports to be, it was hardly as inclusive as it could have been. There have always been peopleespecially women, queer people, and folks of colorwho have felt alienated and been pushed to the margins in punk. Its hard for me as a black woman who grew up in the [PERSON] area to be too focused on a past that didnt always make room for me.ltnlgt DATE26, even as the fight for inclusion continues, a new intersectionality is emerging in the local punk movement, a remedy for the slew of retrospective projects that feature a sea of predominately white and male faces.ltnlgt [ORGANIZATION]s music combines disco, hip-hop, house, electronic, and dance with a message that challenges power structures and calls for progressive action and awareness. They defy an easy genre label, though they accept the term dance-punk.ltnlgt Weve also been called neo-soul, said [PERSON]2 [ORGANIZATION], the lead singer. Because apparently when there are three black women singing, that automatically equals soul.ltnlgtltnlgt [PERSON] [PERSON]2 [ORGANIZATION] of [ORGANIZATION] and the [ORGANIZATION]1 performs at the ORG58 basement show in DATE9, in support of the ORG58s ORG2. [PERSON] is really good at mythologizing its punk and hardcore past, she says. But lets not forget that as radical as it purports to be, it was hardly as inclusive as it could have been.ltnlgtltnlgtltnlgtTheir DATE9 performance in the [ORGANIZATION] basement was joyous and glamorousthe completely sober [TIME] crowd was all smiles and danceand at the same time profoundly moving. Especially moving was the song Requiem for a [ORGANIZATION], in which [PERSON]2 calls out the names of victims of police violence. We dance for every black and queer and trans body thats been told our lives dont matter, because we know they do, she exclaimed before [PERSON]3 and Rain [ORGANIZATION] joined in with the lyrics Hands up, dont shoot, no more strange fruit.ltnlgt Above all, though, the performance was provoking and motivating. Their song Dont Touch My Hair elicited cheers, and [ORGANIZATION] to Nothing, about gentrification that displaces longtime residents and erases the citys cultural history, produced claps and knowing nods in the audience. They might not have sounded like what some would expect punk to sound like, but the gloomy basement was infused with a sense of radical possibility and, importantly, inclusion.ltnlgt Now less a distinctive sound or look than it is a [STREET] of creating art, perhaps [PERSON]1 truest indicator is its [ORGANIZATION] ethosthe idea that art need not have a steep entrance fee, and that anyone with a guitar can be a creator without help from the commercial industry or even music lessons.ltnlgt With [PERSON]1 lo-fi values, the absence of the kinds of barriers posed by requirements of virtuosity or fancy equipment provides a path to those who would crash its gates.ltnlgt For DATE27 she has lived in the GPE6, [PERSON]5, the drummer of [PERSON]7 whose newsletters to fans often include links to social justice stories20, has been active in promoting womens inclusion in local music. She is a founding member of [PERSON]8 [LOCATION], a DATE28 [LOCATION]1 camp where volunteers teach girls to play instruments and form bands, with the mission of instilling confidence and creating supportive and creative spaces. She was also one of the planners of the legendary LadyFest music festival in DATE29 The accessibilityin terms of going from not knowing how to play an instrument to knowing how to play it enough to compose a song with other people in a short period of timeis a big part of what punk means to me, said [PERSON]6. You dont have to wait around to consume art you can do it yourself.ltnlgt It helps, too, that [PERSON] punk scene is particularly encouraging and welcoming to new artists. I feel like people are so supportive, just by showing up and saying that you want to be part of everything, said [PERSON]7, the bassist for [PERSON]9. Its been kind of overwhelming.ltnlgtltnlgt [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION] and the [ORGANIZATION]1 perform the song Dont Touch My Hair in the basement of FAC5 in DATE9. The lyrics include the lines I see you there, I know youre eyeing meStaring like Im some great [ORGANIZATION] is a lot of pressure, added guitarist and singer [PERSON]8, because instant acceptance can also mean instant placement in a legacy.ltnlgt A case in point [PERSON]9 had only been a band for [LOCATION]0 when they were asked to perform at the first basement show in [LOCATION]. [ORGANIZATION] through the show, [PERSON]9 guitar broke in half. Before he could stop the music, he said, [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]8of the ORG50 and other bands, organizer of the beloved [ORGANIZATION] free [LOCATION]1 concert [DATE], and sister of the storied [PERSON]7was up front, holding his guitar together, instructing him to keep playing.ltnlgt ltnlgt WHEN YOU ARE MAKING HISTORY, you dont know it, PERSON10 told me. Youre just doing whatever youre doing. Hopefully, youre doing something passionate, creative, and making the world a more just and caring [STREET]. For PERSON42, that means continuing to use art to effect change and not being tempted to focus only on the past.ltnlgt We use the past as a source of fuel, PERSON42 said, as a [STREET] to energize us for what we can do now. What moment are we missing now? What is possible now? Its not the moment that it was in [LOCATION]8 its a very different GPE4, [PERSON]ltnlgt A primary concern in that very different [PERSON] is the economic transformation of the city brought by the influx of government contractors and dark political money. And of course, all the condos.ltnlgt At a lunchtime concert on a [DATE] in [LOCATION]3, under the bright fluorescent lights of the front hall of the [ORGANIZATION], PERSON14, frontman of the band [LOCATION], climbed onto chairs and stepped over audience members, trailing a long microphone cord behind him.ltnlgt The citys changing, new buildings, PERSON43 began monologuing, tossing his mop of black hair out of his eyes. We werent consulted about the state the city would be in! He wore a sleek silver-gray suit in his trademark mod style, and behind him on the stage, in front of the glass doors that said  POPULAR LIBRARY, were his bandmates, a male drummer and two women on bass and guitar in stylish matching silver suits.ltnlgtltnlgt [PERSON] PERSON14 of the band [PERSON]s in [ORGANIZATION] in downtown GPE4, [PERSON], in [LOCATION]3. Their song [LOCATION] the City addresses the rapid gentrification that has moved through the city, an increasingly common theme in [PERSON] punk music.ltnlgtltnlgtltnlgtYou do construction? PERSON43, formerly of the bands [ORGANIZATION] and ORG[DATE], continued as ORG58 patrons holding books looked on in curiosity. Man, I do destruction!ltnlgt Delivering that introduction to the song [LOCATION] the City, he kicked the air, sometimes collapsed to the ground, and sang about tearing down real estate, cool bars, and all the trappings of economic revitalization.ltnlgt As PERSON44 of ORG51 wrote, gentrification has replaced PERSON45 as the new villain in punk music. Theres concern about resident displacement, income and racial inequality, and unaffordable housing. And in terms of cultural creativity, theres the fact that its often just too expensive to be an artist and live in the city, a subject [ORGANIZATION] singer [PERSON] spoke to in a recent an interview with ORG52 In the audience at the lunchtime show was [PERSON]7, who said hello to a group of students from [PERSON] Public Schools, including [PERSON]1, who was there with the vinyl clubs adviser, PERSON46, a social worker at [ORGANIZATION]5. The students had [LOCATION]3 at school, a lucky break that allowed [PERSON]2 to see one of her favorite bands. PERSON47 has organized field trips to record stores and the first two ORG58 basement shows. She said that many of the students are deeply connected to the citys punk history simply because their parents were the ones who made the music. We went to the archive, and they were like, Oh look, theres my dad on this record, she said. PERSON47 calls the students punk progeny.ltnlgt With a new punk retrospective project, talk, or event announced seemingly [DATE], its to the ORG58s credit that they seem to be combating nostalgia fatigue by making an effort to tell young musicians, in the words of librarian [ORGANIZATION], Your music matters just as much as ORG7s. Through their basement show series, they are staking a [STREET] in the citys ongoing musical history by insisting that every show features one [PERSON]-based high school band, such as [PERSON].ltnlgt The cool thing about the ORG2, PERSON47 said, is that they can go and see the history, but then see history being made at the same time. Theyre continuing to grow in their own musical [STREET].ltnlgt PERSON12, too, hopes his film will help the punk scene grow and continue to engage with important issues. Hopefully, it will serve as a trampoline for moving forward, he said. Maybe, once fans get the nostalgia out of their system, they can continue to fight the system.ltnlgt ltnlgtltnlgt [PERSON] [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION] performs in the basement of GPE4, [PERSON] central public ORG58. The night of the performance, DATE21 4, ORG56 protests were weaving through the nations capital following the announcement that the ORG57 officer who had held PERSON48 in a fatal chokehold would not be indicted. Between songs, [PERSON]0 encouraged the audience to pay attention and engage in protest themselves.ltnlgtltnlgtltnlgtWHILE PERSON49 [DATE] BE RIGHT to be wary of the term, if being punk is simply a matter of embracing an ideology that is critical of power dynamics and cares for the community, then [ORGANIZATION] fits the description. And those attending the ORG58 basement show in DATE21 were treated to a decidedly punk show.ltnlgt There were the small indications that the show had a leftish bent[PERSON]1 was wearing a T-shirt featuring a screen-printed photo of [ORGANIZATION] PERSON50 with the words [ORGANIZATION] And then there are [ORGANIZATION] lyrics[DATE], which are unapologetically anti-consumerist as well as anti-authority PERSON51 killed something in me, and Im gonna get him for it!ltnlgt But the news had made this nightDATE21 4, [DATE] charged night, both in the ORG58 basement and elsewhere in the nations capital. [LOCATION]5, a grand jury had decided not to indict the ORG57 officer who had held PERSON48 in a fatal chokehold, and a large protest26 was working its [STREET] to the GPE4 Monument from the ORG59 headquarters. The marchers, just blocks away from the ORG58, could be heard outside. When [ORGANIZATION] appeared [TIME] before on a GPE8 television show with legendary riot-grrrl band [PERSON], [PERSON]0 wore a ORG56 T-shirt for the performance27.ltnlgt At the ORG58, [PERSON]0 still didnt shy away from the political, encouraging the audience to engage in meaningful protest and pay attention to what was happening outside. [ORGANIZATION] is a personal pla-ane! she cried while standing tall on one of the monitors, towering over the audience. The sound system at [ORGANIZATION] [LOCATION]6 had been, of course, perfectly good, but there was something far more appropriate and satisfying about the sound crashing into and ricocheting imperfectly off the rectangular walls of the dark basement. The atmosphere was different, tooit wasnt just a performance it was a political experience.ltnlgt A librarian wrapped up the show by stepping onto the stage. At the microphone, she thanked everyone for coming, and reminded them to check the website [LOCATION] ORG58 dot org slash punk!ltnlgt  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  DATE22  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  [DATE]  26  27"

As tax-fleeced businesses and individuals flee en masse, and city public spending surges into the stratosphere, financial analysts say [ORGANIZATION] is perilously near total fiscal disaster.44 Bias Report Filed Against Professor for Defending PERSON4 In a ORG3 classroom in [LOCATION], a professor was finishing his lecture when he made a rhetorical aside. The professor was discussing a [ORGANIZATION] slide that referenced [PERSON], a [ORGANIZATION] story in which a married woman makes an offer to have sex with one of her husbands slaves, [ORGANIZATION], only to have him turn her down. To punish him, [PERSON] wife then accuses [ORGANIZATION] of rape This is an issue in our society, the professor allegedly said. Now that you all know what this phrase means, you can go use it to describe the [ORGANIZATION] trial, he is recounted as saying.46 Connecting Dots Creates Shocking Truth47 In [DATE] PERSON8 left [LOCATION] to go and cash-in at [ORGANIZATION]. PERSON9 was running ORG6, on her own personal email server. The [ORGANIZATION] One issue comes to the attention of [LOCATION]0. Like all good public servants do in looking out for [ORGANIZATION] best interest, she decides to support the decision and approve the sale of 20 of GPE3 [ORGANIZATION] to, no other, than the Russians! Notice that it was not a [LOCATION]1 collusion with the [PERSON] was [LOCATION]0. This appeared to be a straight up deal, but was it? The people got absolutely nothing out of if. However, prior to the sales approval, no other than [LOCATION]2 rushed to GPE4, got paid Five Hundred Thousand bucks for a [TIME] speech, then met with [LOCATION]3 at his home for [TIME]. Again, this was a [LOCATION]4, not a [LOCATION]5. Meanwhile, the ORG7 had a mole inside the money laundering and bribery scheme. And the ORG7 director during this time? Yep, [LOCATION]6 who even delivered a [ORGANIZATION] Sample to GPE4 in [DATE]. And who handled that case within [LOCATION] out of [ORGANIZATION] in [PERSON]? Better sit downRod [LOCATION]7. As for the informant, ORG9 placed a GAG order on him and threatened to put him behind bars if he spoke out about it. [ORGANIZATION]0. How did 20 of the most strategic asset of [LOCATION] end up in Russian hands when the ORG7 has an informant, a mole, providing inside information to the ORG7 on the criminal enterprise? After the sale was approved, 145 Million dollars in donations made their [STREET] into the [LOCATION]4 Foundation from entities directly connected to the [ORGANIZATION] One deal. [LOCATION]8 was still at [ORGANIZATION]2 working with [ORGANIZATION]3 where she regularly blocked legitimate churches and ministers from receiving a tax exemption. WHOOSH! It is now [ORGANIZATION] 48 Deaths From Suicide, Drugs ...cohol Hit an All-Time High in [PERSON] Dont let anyone tell you GPE7 is in decline! From [ORGANIZATION]4 In [DATE], more than 151,000 [LOCATION]s died of suicide or causes related to drugs or alcohol  the highest rate in [PERSON], according to a new study by Trust for [ORGANIZATION] Health and Well Being TrustThe drug and suicide epidemics have hit rural GPE7 hardest, at the same time that blue collar jobs are disappearing and technology and automation is transforming [ORGANIZATION] a Lot Worse Than [LOCATION]5 in FAC0 by [LOCATION]9 Progressives claim President [LOCATION]5 marks a new low in [LOCATION] political and presidential history, personifying a singularly odious message. But if we examine the present pantheon of progressive icons, and strip away their reliance on liberal-media protection and transfer them instead into the present age of tabloid promiscuity and cyber omnipresence, would we now have a very different view of their presidencies? The progressive [LOCATION]0 administration likely would never have completed its two elected terms had it operated on media protocols common [ORGANIZATION]. For [PERSON] during the failing health and death of First Lady [LOCATION]1, the president fell into a state of debilitating depression, carefully hidden from the press. DATE8, during DATE9 of [LOCATION]2 presidency, he was more or less unable to fulfill his duties due to a series of strokes that left him partially paralyzed and visually impaired. Those realities were carefully hidden from the public by the efforts of his second wife, [LOCATION]3, and physician Dr. [LOCATION]4. In the present case, we know that [LOCATION]5 is neither comatose nor is [LOCATION] running the country. The country never learned the full extent of [LOCATION]5 paralysis. Much less did it know of [LOCATION]9s past and ongoing affairs  the mechanics of which were sometimes carried out in FAC1 and with the skillful aid of his own daughter [LOCATION]6. By [LOCATION]0, [LOCATION]7, seeking a fourth term, was suffering from a series of life-threatening conditions. Worrying that the public would not vote yet again for a terminally ill president, sympathetic journalists and military physicians covered up [LOCATION]7s illnesses  on the theory that [LOCATION]9 would survive long enough to get elected to a fourth term and ensure a continued Democratic administration.  [PERSON]0, by contemporary standards, was a serial sexual harasser, if not a likely assaulter. While physically in FAC1 he carried on sexual trysts with subordinates and others without security clearances, mostly with the full knowledge of the complacent [ORGANIZATION]6 press corps. One former [PERSON]1 intern, [PERSON]2, later wrote a memoir describing losing her virginity at [LOCATION]1 to the president in FAC1 presidential bed. [PERSON]3 was not just a serial adulterer and often corrupt, but displayed a level of crudity that would now be seen as clinical, from conducting business while defecating on the toilet to exposing his genitals to staff  apparently as some sort of Freudian proof of his own, and by extension, his nations, manhood.  There is no reason to review the escapades of an impeached [LOCATION]2. Despite the efforts of a sympathetic media, many of his transgressions were in part aired to the public. They ran the full gamut of a classical sexist and misogynist, from likely sexually assaulting chance acquaintances to attempting to defame and ruin the reputations of women deemed liable to disclose past liaisons. What differentiates [LOCATION]5s womanizing from that of prior presidents, like [LOCATION]4s, is that his escapades were prior to, not during, his presidential service. A study published by the liberal [ORGANIZATION]7 found that coverage of the [LOCATION]5 presidency in [LOCATION]2 was [LOCATION]4 percent negative, as evidenced in [ORGANIZATION]8, [ORGANIZATION]9 and [ORGANIZATION], in addition to ORG21, ORG22, ORG23 and [PERSON] parent ORG25, as well as European news outlets ORG26, ORG27 and ORG28 in [LOCATION]. The same researchers found that coverage of [LOCATION]5 was about twice as negative as had been true of reporting on [PERSON]6. NOTA BENE [PERSON]7 escapades have yet to be shared, but they will surface eventually52 Destroying GPE7 From Within, Part 353 by [PERSON]8 Once muslims have established a mosque and created an enclave they begin to grow the population. They use population to take a country over. A popular must have 2.5 children per married couple. Most places are producing less than that but the muslim populations in the [LOCATION], [LOCATION], [PERSON]0 and even GPE7 are producing 5-7 children per married couple. They will actually out populate the local people. Their population growth is where they do their dirty work on the nations they immigrate to. When the Muslim population remains at or under 2, their presence tends to fly low under the radar. In the 2  5 range, Muslims begin to seek converts, targeting those they see as disaffected, such as criminals. When the population reaches 5 they exert influence disproportionate to their numbers, becoming more aggressive and pushing for Sharia law. When the population hits the 10 mark Muslims become increasingly lawless and violent. Once the population reaches 20, there is an increase in rioting, murder, jihad militias, and destruction of non-Muslim places of worship. At [LOCATION]3, there are widespread massacres, chronic terror attacks, and ongoing militia warfare. Once beyond [DATE], infidels and apostates are persecuted, genocide occurs, and Sharia law is implemented. After [LOCATION]4, intimidation is a [LOCATION]5 part of life along with violent jihad and some state-run genocide as the nation purges all infidels. Once the nation has rid itself of all non-Muslims, the presumption is that [LOCATION] has been attained  ORG30 What does it look like in GPE7? Not good for our kids and grandkids. Even when Muslims are a minority population they can and do transform whole cultures and societies. And not for the better.

PERSON43 and his daughter, [LOCATION]6 PERSON44, were arrested in [PERSON]7, [PERSON]8, near the GPE3Mexico border, for the murder of PERSON45, Acting [PERSON]5 Police Commissioner PERSON46 said at a news conference. They were reportedly preparing to leave the country. ORG36 reports on [DATE]0, [DATE]1, PERSON45 was riding in a car on FAC2 when she saw a woman holding a sign that read please help me feed my baby. The woman was also reportedly carrying what appeared to be a baby in her arms. Reports say when PERSON45 gave the woman money, a man reached into the car, grabbed PERSON47 wallet, stabbed her and ran away. PERSON45 later died in a local hospital. The crime attracted national attention and prompted many people to regard panhandlers warily. PERSON48 said that the concocted story took advantage of negative perceptions of [PERSON]5 crime58 Selling Socialism to [ORGANIZATION] is a tough sell to [LOCATION]s who evaluate ideas based on facts and a remarkably easy sell to [LOCATION]s who evaluate ideas based on feelings.

The city has paid out 34 million to 56 families since [DATE]6, according to a [LOCATION]1 analysis of city comptroller data obtained through a Freedom of Information request. More than [LOCATION]30 cases are pending. One of the biggest payouts by the [LOCATION]2 system  3.2 million  went to the family of [ORGANIZATION]4, who died [DATE]7 after doctors at [LOCATION]3 in [ORGANIZATION]1 ignored her tuberculosis diagnosis, then repeatedly botched her treatment, leading to a harrowing [DATE]8 decline that ended with her death of catastrophic organ failure in [DATE]6, according to [STREET] documents.  In another [ORGANIZATION]2 case, [ORGANIZATION]5 of [ORGANIZATION]1 lost both his pregnant wife, [ORGANIZATION]6, and their unborn son in [ORGANIZATION] when physicians ignored [ORGANIZATION]7 past history of cardiac problems, failed to notice that an X-ray showed she had an enlarged heart and missed symptoms of peritonitis  a cascade of negligence that led to both deaths, according to [STREET] documents. The city paid the widower 900,000 in [DATE]. [ORGANIZATION]2 had the highest number of wrongful-death claims of any [LOCATION]4 hospital, with 91 filed from [DATE]6 through [DATE]1  far more than the 54 cases logged against No. 2, the much larger [LOCATION]5 in [ORGANIZATION]3.

[PERSON]9 was referring to [ORGANIZATION]7 possibly signing up for [ORGANIZATION]6, the new Silk [STREET], on which talks are at an advanced stage.

This sounds absurd, but it is believable in a country where extreme poverty has spread like the plague. Human capital is fleeing. Oil production is plummeting, and the state-owned oil company is in default. The garbage bag, imported with dollars, is a thing of value. If anything was more predictable than the mess created by PERSON83 Bolivarian Revolution, it is the pathetic effort by socialists to deny responsibility. [ORGANIZATION] tweeted recently that [LOCATION]0s problem is that socialism has yet to be tried. It blamed the crisis on a profit-driven capitalist economy under leftist state-control. Even more preposterous is the claim by some academics that economic liberalism in the 19[LOCATION]4s spawned the socialism that has destroyed the country. Learning from history is impossible if the narrative is wrong. So lets clear the record By the time PERSON84 was elected, [LOCATION]0 already had [LOCATION]3 [DATE] of socialism under its belt and precious little, if any, experience with free markets. Military dictator [PERSON] was toppled in [ORGANIZATION]1. PERSON86, an avowed socialist, was elected president [ORGANIZATION]2. When [LOCATION]0 promulgated its [ORGANIZATION]3 constitution, PERSON87 immediately suspended Article 96, which read All can freely engage in the profitable activity of their choice, without any limitations other than those provided for in this Constitution and those established by law for security, health or other reasons of social interest. This crucial protection remained on the shelf for [ORGANIZATION]4, as a string of socialist governments employed price and exchange controls in counterproductive attempts to raise living standards. Rent control in [LOCATION]0 dates to [ORGANIZATION]5 but was not enforced by Prez PERSON88. In [ORGANIZATION]6 PERSON87 revived it, passing a new rent-control law and prohibitions on eviction. Since then, not one apartment rental building has been built, writes PERSON89 in his [DATE] book, [LOCATION]0n [ORGANIZATION]. The legendary slums that climb [LOCATION]1s hillsides are a testament to this socialist stupidity.  PERSON90 took office for a second time in [ORGANIZATION]7 and restored price and exchange controls. By [ORGANIZATION]8, facing another collapse, he reversed course again, liberating prices and opening markets. The adjustment exposed reality but was painful, especially in the face of falling oil prices. Thus, the ground was fertile for an antiestablishment candidate in [ORGANIZATION]9. PERSON84 was inaugurated in [PERSON]0, in the midst of a recovery in oil prices and with the bolivar at 576 to the dollar. He tripled down on socialism, exacerbating a long history of destroying capital that would lead to [PERSON]1 disaster.

Of course, one of the traditions as old as graduation itself is the guest speaker who delivers a stirring and inspiring address to the graduates and their family and friends in attendance. [ORGANIZATION]7, celebrities, politicians, and CEOs speak at college graduations. It shouldnt be much of a surprise that left-leaning speakers are prominent at college commencement ceremonies, but whats astonishing is that, in [ORGANIZATION]8, only three of the top 100 colleges and universities are featuring conservative speakers. 116 Husband Charged With Wifes Possible Mercy Killing In [ORGANIZATION]7, Offici[PERSON]s Say117 [ORGANIZATION]8  An [ORGANIZATION]9 man is being charged with murder in the death of his wife.

He saw the aftermath of the crash and described it as tragic. PERSON38 security detail and other officers assigned to [ORGANIZATION] were among the first to respond to the crash a block away on [ORGANIZATION].

She did not specify how this b[PERSON]ance might be achieved, or who would have the last word in defining it. Seemingly suggesting that suppressing free speech to some unspecified extent would be the [STREET] to go in de[PERSON]ing with cases of extreme violence, this [PERSON] offici[PERSON] made it clear that it was once again soci[PERSON] media that politicians would like to see moderate and censor even more than they do now. 128 ORG59 [ORGANIZATION] in New Round of Layoffs129 [DATE]7 ORG35ORG59 laid off 150 employees [ORGANIZATION] as the streaming giant faces subscriber losses, slower revenue growth and a shareholder lawsuit.

And so far, the police have been successful in turning the tide, with [PERSON]7 [PERSON]ready poised to drop a law banning faci[PERSON] scanning not even [DATE] after it was adopted. In [PERSON]l, about 25 states now have this type of rule in [STREET], but reports suggest that the future of these bills is far from certain. 1[DATE]5 [PERSON]8-Area Leftist Arrested for Child Sex Crimes, Urinating in ORG62 [PERSON] at Work137 While investigating a [PERSON]9, [PERSON] man for the possession and distribution of child pornography, police discovered that PERSON[LOCATION]00 had taken a video of himself urinating into the milkshake mix at a loc[PERSON] ORG62 where he worked as a night shift manager.

The single mother argues the [LOCATION] administrative law judges are unconstitution[PERSON] because they enjoy layers of good-cause tenure protection, overseen by ORG70 whose members can only be removed by the president for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or m[PERSON]feasance in office. 140 The Game is Over ORG71 [PERSON] Says it is on [ORGANIZATION]-level artifici[PERSON] intelligence is close to fin[PERSON]ly being achieved, according to a lead researcher at ORG71 [PERSON] [LOCATION] division. [PERSON] said the game is over in the [PERSON]7-long quest to re[PERSON]ise artifici[PERSON] gener[PERSON] intelligence [ORGANIZATION] after [PERSON] unveiled an [LOCATION] system capable of completing a wide range of complex tasks, from stacking blocks to writing poetry. Described as a gener[PERSON]ist agent, [PERSON]s new Gato [LOCATION] needs to just be sc[PERSON]ed up in order to create an [LOCATION] capable of riv[PERSON]ling human intelligence, Dr PERSON48 said. 142 PERSON49 Support of Dr. PERSON50 Puts Kingmaker Status to the Test in 3-[STREET] [PERSON]0 ORG74 Primary Race143 President [ORGANIZATION]2s status as kingmaker of the ORG74 is being put to the test in a three-[STREET] ORG74 primary race [ORGANIZATION] in the battleground state of [PERSON]0. 1[LOCATION]00 Work-Related Trips Down 20 Percent in [PERSON] as Commuters Prefer to Stay Home145 The number of people commuting to and from work [PERSON]8 is still down an average of 20 percent compared to pre-pandemic levels, according to a new study. The study was conducted by a multination[PERSON] team of researchers, with team members coming from the [PERSON], [PERSON]1 and the [ORGANIZATION], c[PERSON]led [LOCATION]. [ORGANIZATION] reported that the same study found that many Americans would be willing to quit their job and find a new one, rather than have to go back to commuting [PERSON]9 per week. The outlet added that the results reported by the researchers [PERSON]so found that the average American employee is now working [DATE] from home, even as [PERSON] cases continue to plunge worldwide. 146 Are Parents Rights Over Their Children Now at Risk in [PERSON]2?147 In [PERSON]2, it seems the government is using its majority to enact laws that increasingly restrict the rights and freedoms of its citizens. Indeed, [PERSON]2s [PERSON], An Act to amend the Youth Protection Act and other legislative provisions, was adopted on [DATE], [ORGANIZATION]8 and became law on DATE52. This has many parents, and [PERSON]2ers in gener[PERSON], quite worried, since the amendment concerns the governments power over child custody. The law will prioritize the custody of children to ORG77 instead of the childs natur[PERSON] family, consequently encroaching on parent[PERSON] rights. Therefore, any family involved with youth protection services could now lose custody of their child if the department deems it best for the childs he[PERSON]th. However, the amendments brought to the bill are much more complex, thats why [PERSON], a lawyer and [PERSON] from [PERSON]3, sat down with us to better explain the bills implications and to bring attention to what he considers a potenti[PERSON] risk to our democracy.

In addition, [ORGANIZATION] tripled its result to over 18 percent. 178 Hungarian Cardin[PERSON] Seen as Possible Successor to Ailing [PERSON] PERSON86179 Due to [PERSON] PERSON86 frail he[PERSON]th, speculation as to his successor is gaining momentum, and following an article in [LOCATION], French and It[PERSON]ian papers are [PERSON]ready guessing at who the next [ORGANIZATION] could be. One name that comes up often  and indeed, has been suggested since the conclave that elected [PERSON] PERSON86  is that of Cardin[PERSON] PERSON87, [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON] PERSON86 was forced into a wheelchair [LOCATION]0 due to his severe knee pain, and the rumor mill has been churning ever since of a conclave. Guesses have been made in the columns of the French and It[PERSON]ian dailies as to who the most likely candidate to take over the leadership of the FAC10 will be after [PERSON] PERSON86. The It[PERSON]ian papers reflect on an article that popped up in [LOCATION] which made an in-depth an[PERSON]ysis of cardin[PERSON]s who had a chance at the papacy. According to predictions, the two major contenders are the conservative Hungarian cardin[PERSON] PERSON87 and the cardin[PERSON] PERSON88, Archbishop of GPE72, who is understood to be a progressive in church circles. 180 [ORGANIZATION]! Forced Masking Continues Despite ORG1 Lifting Lockdown Rules on Flights181 A host of ORG1 nations have insisted that they will keep forcing plane passengers to wear masks, despite the ORG1 lifting its bloc-wide requirement on [DATE]1. Although many passengers on intra-ORG1 flights will no longer be forced to wear a mask from [DATE]1, a host of nation-states have insisted that they will keep forcing passengers to mask up despite the relaxation of the lockdown measure. 182 PERSON89 [PERSON] is Subjecting Itself to Suicide Waves of Decline183 In a speech to mark him taking the oath of office, Hungarian Prime Minister [PERSON] warned that the west is subjecting itself to suicide waves of decline in the form of self-inflicted economic wounds, mass migration and an obsession with identity politics.

The biggest ch[PERSON]lenge is at the border where the difference in rail gauges slows down transport.

[PERSON]8 told [ORGANIZATION] that it is the effect of epidemic data and assessments of the situation in Polish hospit[PERSON]s. He stressed, however, that despite lifting the state of the epidemic, it does not mean that it is over. No minister in the world can end the epidemic by his decision, the Polish he[PERSON]th minister explained. The epidemic is still with us, but it is progressively moving to the state of endemic, that is probably best illustrated by flu in our country. 188 Politic[PERSON] Correctness is [DATE] New Religion189 The supermarket chain [ORGANIZATION] has apologized to Muslims for stigmatizing them by mentioning that the shortage of sunflower oil was in part caused by certain soci[PERSON] groups needing the product to celebrate religious holiDATE86s such as [LOCATION]3 when that oil is used to fry lamb.

The moves by the two Nordic countries, ending [PERSON]0s more than 200 [DATE]4 of military non[PERSON]ignment and [ORGANIZATION]1 non[PERSON]ignment after World War II, have provoked the ire of the [ORGANIZATION]5. 198 [ORGANIZATION] Police Are Solving the Lowest Ever Proportion of Crimes After Focussing on Speech Offenses199 To paraphrase an old adage, if a police force has to ask itself whether it is acting like a thought police  it probably is. And another certainty is that the answer it comes up with will highly likely still be, no. But now, there is seemingly a desire to reverse the trend and once again have the police focus on de[PERSON]ing with actu[PERSON] crime, instead of, to [PERSON]l intents and purposes, getting involved in politics. Thats what [ORGANIZATION]s new chief inspector of constabulary, PERSON100, is saying, asserting that the countrys police should not act like the thought police, and unwittingly reve[PERSON]ing how bad things have gotten by saying that officers must remember that different thoughts are not forbidden. 200 [ORGANIZATION] Extinction Rebellion Protesters Storm Five-Star Centr[PERSON] [PERSON]6 Hotel201 Extinction Rebellion activists have stormed a five-star hotel in centr[PERSON] [PERSON]6 in protest of an oil summit taking [STREET] on [ORGANIZATION].

Peace t[PERSON]ks between [LOCATION]5n and [LOCATION] delegations have been suspended, both sides said [ORGANIZATION]. Ambitions are growing in [LOCATION]0 about what would define victory. [ORGANIZATION]8 [PERSON]0 and [PERSON]4 will send on [LOCATION] their applications to become members of [ORGANIZATION], the two countries said. [PERSON]8 has set out demands for its approv[PERSON] for them to join the [PERSON]liance. Polish offici[PERSON]s said they are meeting with military contractors in the hope of bolstering [ORGANIZATION] military capabilities.

About five thousand people were estimated to be on the march and nothing was ruining their DATE86.

How would you get started? And how best to turn it to your advantage and boost your profits? We have the answers right here. A simple 12 step plan. 1. Find some vague criteria for what constitutes the symptoms that you want people to look for. Anything subjective that a lot of people can identify with is ideal. Let us take memory problems andor confusion  a few common ones from the [ORGANIZATION] list. Tiredness, aches and pains are common and subjective enough. For covid19 the symptoms are fever, dry cough, tiredness. Less common symptoms aches and pains, sore throat, diarrhoea, loss of taste or smell, a rash, or discolouration of fingers or toes It would be a good idea to take something that is very common in old people so that we can use death from old age as proof of the lethality of the new virus. 2. Then we would need something biological to test. Any RNA sequence would do, as long as it is not present in the whole population. If it were, someone might claim herd immunity very quickly. Actually it could be an RNA sequence that does not really exist in humans but something that could exist as contamination in labs, e.g. in dust or water. That would be enough for a RT qPCR test to pick up as a false positive. Many RT PCRs have false positive rates of 3-5  and that would be plenty to create a scare. When it comes to [ORGANIZATION], the false positive rate is impossible to know for sure, since we dont have a gold standard to check against, but for many other similar tests, the average false positive rate is over 3. And different labs are testing for different sequences. We can count on over-stressed labs to be more prone to contamination than labs taking part in research knowing they will be checked for accuracy, the ones that gave over 3 false positives. [ORGANIZATION]2be the error rate for the average stressed lab is as high as 8. [ORGANIZATION] counts 5 as a reasonable estimate. With 8 we would have all positive tests in the [PERSON] explained by false positives 3. Then we are all set to go. We just have to claim that we have discovered a new cluster of symptoms and that is related to a new RNA sequence. It starts with memory loss, and confusion. In other words this is a neurotoxic virus, and it leads to death in all the ways old people can die, by strokes, heart attacks, pneumonia, kidney failure, sepsis, organ failure, dehydration. It doesnt matter if the patient was close to deaths door anyway, because of existing problems. We can always claim that without our new virus, they would not have died. Who could counter that? just like [ORGANIZATION] People die from all kinds of disorders that they already had before the got the [ORGANIZATION] test. 4. By some miracle we have already discovered exactly the virus that is responsible among the millions of different viruses that exist in any cubic centimeter of air. So we already have a RT PCR test read to go. This makes us look like very competent researchers. Of course we have bought stock in the major testing labs ahead of time. Weve bought stocks in the biggest vaccine manufacturers also of course. That will be the biggest money maker finally, hopefully for [ORGANIZATION] since it will be difficult to get antibodies to something that doesnt really exist.

Suddenly, youve got government officials in this case, teachers or anyone at the school on the other end of that virtual connection being allowed carte blanche visual access to the inside of ones private home without a warrant. Anything those school officials see-anything they hear-anything they photograph or record-during that virtual visit becomes fair game for scrutiny and investigation not just by school officials but by every interconnected government agency to which that information can be relayed the police, social services, animal control, ORG38, you name it. After all, this is the age of overcriminalization, when the federal criminal code is so vast that the average GPE28n unknowingly commits about three federal felonies per DATE44, a GPE29 Attorney can find a [STREET] to charge just about anyone with violating federal law. Its a train wreck just waiting to happen.127 Woman Suspected of Mailing Ricin to [ORGANIZATION] ORG26 Arrested at GPE29-[LOCATION] Border128 ORG39 says initial information suggests that the letter originated in [LOCATION] Three GPE29 law enforcement officials say a woman suspected of sending an envelope containing the poison ricin, which was addressed to [ORGANIZATION] ORG26 and President Donald [ORGANIZATION], has been arrested at the [PERSON]0-[LOCATION] border.

The report quotes sources from the [PERSON] Africa Command and the [PERSON] Office of the Inspector General. The same sources reveal that dozens of military advisors of the Turkish company [ORGANIZATION]8 are also in [PERSON]8, training the Syrian fighters and monitoring the DATE44-to-DATE44 operations of Turkish-affiliated militias. Rumors around [ORGANIZATION]8 have started circulating shortly after the publication of the report, and some recent comments of the companys President [DATE] for [ORGANIZATION]9 did not provide any further clarity. We shall now have a brief look into the company that according to many commentators could be the Turkish counterpart to the Russian ORG60 on the [PERSON]8n front. Who is [DATE]?

Hundreds of soldiers blocked off the center of [PERSON]1, deploying water cannons and armored personnel carriers and erecting barbed wire barriers. Protests also took [STREET] in several other cities, including [PERSON]2 and [PERSON]3. The crowd in [PERSON]1 included about 100,000 people, said PERSON47, head of the ORG61 human rights organization. He said dozens of demonstrators were arrested in [PERSON]1 and [PERSON]3.156 The Scene Was Horrific Persecution of Christians, DATE41 [DATE] Rape and [ORGANIZATION] Christians in [PERSON]5 In late DATE41, PERSON48, a DATE49 Christian girl, escaped from the home of PERSON49 kidnapper, whom ORG62 had recently ruled is her legitimate husband despite her objectionsand fled to a police station, where she gave testimony, including on how she was being forced into prostitution and filmed while by being raped, with threats that the tape would be published unless she complies with the demands of her rapisthusband and friends. They threatened to murder my whole family, the girl said. My life was at stake in the hands of the accused and PERSON50 repeatedly raped me forcefully. In an interview, a friend of PERSON51 family described how the family is in hiding and constantly on the run, adding [PERSON] is traumatized. She cannot speak.

The world assumes it will never follow through. Yet as [PERSON]3 flexes its muscles at home and abroad, is that being dangerously complacent? [PERSON]9s Foreign Minister PERSON55 is ringing the alarm, hoping that the world will pay attention to the profound threat emanating from GPE60. The threat is very real and therefore [PERSON]9s preparation is also very serious, he told ORG63. We are trying to deal with the military threat, DATE44 in and DATE44 out. GPE60s aggressive military probing has been going on for [ORGANIZATION]  an unending stress test for the democratic island it claims as its territory. 164 [DATE] on Steroids PERSON56 is [PERSON] as He Prepares to Give Police Even More Powers and Refuses to [PERSON]  While [ORGANIZATION] Families165 PERSON56 is being slammed for preparing to give police even more powers while refusing to lift lockdown, and defending a super-spreader family.166 Encrypted Messages, Scouts In the City and Rogue Police Officers Inside the Biggest Ever Anti-Lockdown Rally Set to Take [STREET] in Melbourne167 Almost 700 demonstrators have organised to swarm the citys CBD on [PERSON]3 for a mass rally against the Victorian governments coronavirus restrictions.168 Spider-Like Venom Found in GPE61n Stinging Trees169 ORG64 GPE61 is synonymous with venomous spiders and snakes  but scientists have discovered new toxins in what they label a truly venomous plant. A team of researchers from ORG65 have discovered a previously unidentified neurotoxin that is similar to the venom found in spiders and cone snails. Unlike its GPE28n and [LOCATION]an counterparts, being stung by a dendrocnide tree  which means stinging tree  can cause pain that lasts for DATE44s  or even weeks.170 Boomerang Migrants Given Asylum in [PERSON]4 Despite Being Deported Previously171 At least 50 boomerang migrants have been granted asylum in GPE62, despite having been previously rejected as fraudulent and deported. The number of known boomerang migrants is more than double the figure for DATE52, when 19 migrants were given asylum after being removed and coming back again.172 ORG66 to Push for Radical Changes to Existing Migration Rules for All Nations173 The [LOCATION]an Union is working to repeal [ORGANIZATION], which regulates asylum cases within the ORG66, and replace it with a system that will see migrants shared across [LOCATION], suggested the [LOCATION]an [ORGANIZATION] President [PERSON] in a speech in the [LOCATION]an [ORGANIZATION] on [PERSON]9. We will abolish the [LOCATION] rules and replace them with a new [LOCATION]an migration management system, said PERSON58. The current [LOCATION] Regulation stipulates that asylum seekers must have their application processed in the country where they first arrive, but that could soon change. If the [LOCATION]an [ORGANIZATION] chooses to force migration quotas on member states, it is likely to face substantial pushback from countries opposed to illegal migration like [LOCATION] and [LOCATION], which recently joined five other [LOCATION]an countries in a letter to the [ORGANIZATION] voicing their opposition to migrant quotas.174 Majority of Germans Fear Taking Migrants From GPE65 Will Trigger New Migrant Wave175 A majority of Germans have expressed concern that the German government taking in large numbers of migrants from GPE65 after the [PERSON] migrant camp fire could trigger a new wave of migration. The German government, under Chancellor PERSON59, pledged to take in 1,500 migrants following the [PERSON] fire, seemingly started by migrant arsonists, that left around 13,000 of them homeless on the island of Lesbos.176 Moroccans Make Up [DATE] in [PERSON]2177 A study has revealed that around a quarter of those in juvenile detention in [PERSON]2 come from GPE67 and as many as three in ten illegal migrants have committed some sort of crime. According to the office of the ORG71 High [ORGANIZATION]er for Refugees [PERSON] there are at least 5,500 supposedly underage Moroccans in [PERSON]2, the vast majority of whom live in the countrys North African enclaves of GPE68 and Melilla.178 Over 100 Migrants Jump Overboard From NGO Vessel to [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]1179 Nearly half the migrants aboard a Spanish migrant transport NGO vessel stuck off the coast of [LOCATION] by Italian authorities jumped overboard in a bid to reach Italian shores. The Spanish NGO ORG73 has had it ship stuck off the Sicilian coast for several DATE44s near [LOCATION] waiting for Italian authorities to grant their vessel [INSTITUTION] access to drop off the 275 migrants on board.180 Revealed The Countries Dominating GPE61s Migrant Intake  as New Arrivals Drop to [ORGANIZATION] in DATE54 Due to Coronavirus181 People from GPE70, GPE60 and [PERSON]7 make up the bulk of GPE61s migrant intake, as the PERSON32-19 pandemic forces new arrivals to drop to the lowest number in 15 [ORGANIZATION]. The GPE61n [ORGANIZATION] processed 140,366 permanent arrivals DATE56, with [PERSON] topping the list at 26,000 citizens, followed by 18,587 from GPE60. More than 10,600 [PERSON]4 citizens, 8,960 from the GPE71 and 5,398 Vietnamese people were granted permanent visas. Next on the list was 5,048 Nepalese citizens and 4,997 New Zealanders.182 GPE61 PERSON60 [PERSON] to Strip ORG75 Name From [PERSON] Over Her Views on [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION] Rights183 Three-time Grand Slam champion PERSON60 wants officials to consider renaming ORG76 [PERSON] over the GPE61n tennis greats views on transgender athletes and definition of [ORGANIZATION] rights as of the devil. PERSON61 comments join those from ORG77 founder PERSON62 to remove ORG78 name from one of the main stadiums at the GPE61n [PERSON] venue amid criticism of her beliefs from other senior figures in the sport.184 Netflixs Cuties Its Not the First Attempt by ORG79 to [ORGANIZATION] Pedophilia185 ORG79 has proven itself over the [ORGANIZATION] to be a haven for evil people. Not so much in terms of the celebrities though many of them are narcissistic and sociopathic, but more in terms of the people that control the industry. The entire edifice was designed as a haven for subhuman tendencies. They have celebrated this openly in the past, though these DATE44s they pretend as if they are cleaning house. The machine of ORG79 is a vampires trap, a shining beacon luring in talented or at least hopeful and starstruck people, draining them of all life and then spitting them out once the feeding has finished. This is particularly true of children, and the number of cases of child abuse in the industry is staggering. If it were any other business, the media would be up in arms in terms of the number of convictions and allegations. If the fast food industry had as many pedo charges as ORG79, the ORG80 would be writing thousands of articles [DATE] admonishing the burger barn molestation epidemic. But when it comes to ORG79, mainstream journalists rabidly defend the people at the top and attack critics as conspiracy theorists. The propensity for psychopaths to value children as their most sought after targets is well known. Its not necessarily always sexual, sometimes its only physical or mental abuse. But, children are a delicacy to them none-the-less. What could be more enthralling to evil than to destroy the life of a purely innocent person and take their childhood away? It is only in recent [ORGANIZATION] that pedophilia in ORG79 has been taken more seriously by the general public. The ORG79 elites that dominate high level corporate positions have been the purveyors and controllers of [LOCATION] cultural expression for DATE60, and yet they are rarely subject to scrutiny. It is their own actions that have created the recent groundswell movement to root out organized child abuse I have now watched portions of this film, including dramatic story scenes to get a fair sense of the total content as well as come clips of the notorious scenes that have enraged the public. And, I can say WITHOUT A [ORGANIZATION], this film is in fact child pornagraphy according to ORG81. A warning  I do NOT recommend watching this movie yourself, but if you do, be warned that the content is highly upsetting. If you heard from the mainstream media that the reaction to this film was overblown and part of a right wing conspiracy then Im here to tell you that you were lied to.186 [ORGANIZATION] Panels Generate Mountains of Waste187 The problem of solar panel waste is now becoming evident. As environmental journalist PERSON63 admits in ORG82, when talking about renewable energy, the topic of waste does not often appear. She attributes this to the supposed pressures of climate change and alleged urgency to find alternative energy sources, saying people may thus be hesitant to discuss possible negative impacts of renewable energy. Ms. PERSON64 admits that sustainability requires proper e-waste management. Yet she laments, [ORGANIZATION] presents a particular problem. There is growing evidence that broken panels release toxic pollutants and increasing concern regarding what happens with these materials when they are no longer viable, especially since they are difficult to recycle.188  1  2 420433  3 420387  [DATE]  [DATE]  6 420397  7 420425  [DATE]  [DATE]  [DATE]  [DATE][DATE]  18 420369  [DATE]  [DATE]  [DATE]  [DATE]30 [DATE]  [DATE][DATE]  [DATE] 420395  [DATE][DATE]  [DATE][DATE]  41 420375  [DATE]  44 420473  [DATE]  [DATE]  [DATE]  48 420403  [DATE]  [DATE][DATE]  56 420421  [DATE]59 420469  [DATE][DATE][DATE]  [DATE] topheadline  66  67 topheadline  68  69 topheadline  70  71 topheadline  72  73 topheadline  74  75 topheadline  76  77 topheadline  78  79 topheadline  80  81 topheadline  82  83 topheadline  84  85 topheadline  86  87 topheadline  88  89 topheadline  90  91 topheadline  92  93 topheadline  94  95 topheadline  96  97 topheadline  98  99 topheadline  100  101 topheadline  102  103 topheadline  104  105 topheadline  106  107 topheadline  108  109 topheadline  110 rzerohedgefeed3KAPWk7pcLv8shocking-claim-popular-childrens-app-requests-minor-take-naked-pictures  111 topheadline  112  113 topheadline  114  115 topheadline  116  117 topheadline  118  119 topheadline  120  121 topheadline  122  123 topheadline  124  125 topheadline  126  127 topheadline  128  129  130 topheadline  131  132 topheadline  133  134 topheadline  135  136 topheadline  137  138 topheadline  139  140 topheadline  141  142 topheadline  143  144 topheadline  145  146 topheadline  147  148 topheadline  149  150 topheadline  151  152 topheadline  153  154 topheadline  155  156 topheadline  157  158 topheadline  159  160 topheadline  161  162 topheadline  163  164 topheadline  165  166 topheadline  167  168 topheadline  169  170 topheadline  171  172 topheadline  173  174 topheadline  175  176 topheadline  177  178 topheadline  179  180 topheadline  181  182 topheadline  183  184 topheadline  185  186 topheadline  187  188 topheadline"

There are two kinds of globalist schemes First, there are the schemes they spring on the public out of DATE23here haphazardly in the hopes that the speed of the event along with some shock and awe will confuse the masses and make them psychologically pliable. This strategy loses effectiveness quickly, though the longer the plan takes to implement, the more time the people have to reconsider what is actually happening and why. Second, there are schemes they slowly implant in the collective psyche of the citizenry over [ORGANIZATION], much like subliminal messaging or hypnosis. This strategy is designed to make the public embrace certain destructive ideologies or ideas as if these ideas were their own. The cryptocurrency scam is of the second variety. I have been suspicious of the cryptocurrency narrative of a decentralized and anonymous monetary revolution since [LOCATION], when I was first approached by people claiming to be representatives of bitcoin and asked to become a promoter of the technology. After posing a few very simple questions and receiving no satisfactory answers, I declined to join the bandwagon or act as a frontman It was odd that bitcoin was built around the [ORGANIZATION] hash function created by [ORGANIZATION], and that the entire concept was remarkably similar to what was described in an ORG6 paper published in DATE2 titled How To Make A Mint The Cryptography Of Anonymous Electronic Cash. Then, there were globalist institutions like ORG7 coming out publicly in praise of crypto and blockchain tech. And, finally, central banks began entertaining the notion of moving into crypto, but they made it sound like they were approaching the idea half-heartedly, like it was a potential hobby. So what ties the entire crytpo-scheme together? [ORGANIZATION] has DATE23 openly revealed their affinity with crypto technology, and thus revealed the new world order end game. In a paper published [ORGANIZATION] by [ORGANIZATION] head [ORGANIZATION] titled [ORGANIZATION], the [ORGANIZATION] builds its argument for why central banks including the [ORGANIZATION] should embrace crypto as the future of monetary policy. As I warned [PERSON], the shift into crypto was not at all a revolution against the globalists, but a con designed by the globalists in part to get liberty proponents to become unwitting salesmen for the next phase of the economic control grid. But how do they intend this end game to play out?70 GPE2 Growth Stumbles, German Economy Contracts, Meanwhile [PERSON] GDP Growth71 GPE2 growth remains slow, and has performed worse than expected in the latest figures released [PERSON] which saw the [ORGANIZATION] currency stumble as slowing German exports were shown to be behind the [ORGANIZATION]an powerhouses first GDP contraction since [ORGANIZATION]315.72 [PERSON] Thanks to PERSON3 [PERSON] President [PERSON] received his highest approval rating on the economy, 53 per cent. With [PERSON] unemployment at the lowest in [ORGANIZATION], jobs reports just keep getting larger. Black GPE27ns, Hispanic GPE27ns and Asian GPE27ns all have the lowest unemployment rate in the history of the [PERSON].74 Authorities Are Using a Mysterious New Tool That Can Unlock Virtually Any Cellphone75 Your cellphone is a gold mine of information about where you have been, who you have been talking to, and what you have been doing online. And DATE23 a mysterious new tool is enabling law enforcement authorities all over the nation to get access to that information on virtually any phone. So if you end up going to prison someday, it could be the evidence that is pulled out of your cellphone that ultimately puts you away. Of course most GPE27ns never even consider that their own cellphones could be systematically gathering evidence against them. For most of us, cellphones are simply extremely convenient tools that allow us to communicate effectively with the rest of the world. But if the authorities decide to investigate you, your cellphone is going to be one of the first things that they want, and what they find on there could put you behind bars for a very, very long time. There are some people out there that are still operating under the assumption that the data on their cellphones is safe from the prying eyes of law enforcement authorities. That actually has not been true for a long time, and DATE23 a new tool is enabling them to unlock virtually any cellphone. The following comes from ORG9 These are basically hacking devices, and it may take a number of [TIME], but they will eventually get into your cellphone. These hacking devices reportedly cost between 15,000 and 30,000, so they are quite expensive, but apparently law enforcement agencies all over the nation have been heavily buying them. Because if you can get into the cellphone of a suspect, it often provides everything that is needed to solve a case76 Democrats Use Vote Fraud to Play Their Last Hand Global Warming77 After [PERSON] of trying to pin the tail on the PERSON5 to no avail, the democrats cranked up voter fraud to make a last ditch effort to suspend the workings of our Republic. With GPE4 receiving the lions share of the limelight of midterm election ballot mishandling, little attention has been paid to other states where vote irregularities have cropped up. From [PERSON], GPE6 and GPE7 to GPE8 and GPE9, numerous breaks in chain of custody of ballots has cast a shadow on the results of races for state and congressional seats. Every instance where republicans looked to have a solid or a tight lead, thousands of ballots appeared out of DATE23here to be included in the final tally. Serendipitously discovered after the polls had been closed for [TIME], they added a glut of democrat votes that turned the tide in a number of [PERSON] races. And election officials didnt even blink an eye. By the [STREET], those officials were all affiliated with [ORGANIZATION]0.  Republicans had better take up the challenge and not rest until the vote fraudsters are incarcerated, otherwise Representative PERSON6 may be right that the Right is under siege and may lose the battle in [ORGANIZATION]3[ORGANIZATION]3.78 [PERSON] in Hip in [PERSON]0 [STREET] Rage Incident79 [PERSON]1 police are searching for a woman and a teenager in connection with a stabbing during a [STREET] rage incident in [PERSON]0. County police said officers were called around 10[PERSON]1 a.m. [ORGANIZATION] to FAC0 at FAC1, where a man had been stabbed in the hip. Police said the victim was involved in a [STREET] rage incident wherein two vehicles stopped and the drivers got into an argument. A teenager got out of the car, stabbed the victim in the hip and the suspect vehicle fled, police said. Police described the suspect vehicle was a dark green [ORGANIZATION]1 Compass or [PERSON]. The victim was taken to a hospital with a non-life-threatening stab wound, police said80 [ORGANIZATION]2 Loses 2 Million Subscribers DATE9 According to [ORGANIZATION]3 recently released [LOCATION]0 report, sports network [ORGANIZATION]2 has lost 2 million domestic subscribers over the course of [LOCATION]1. [ORGANIZATION]3 report revealed that the companys sports network, [ORGANIZATION]2, currently has 86 million subscribers. This is down two million from the 88 million subscribers to the sports commentary and news station in DATE[ORGANIZATION]1.82 [ORGANIZATION]2 Loses Two Million More Subscribers in Fiscal [LOCATION]183 [LOCATION]3 [ORGANIZATION]4 announced in its [LOCATION]4 10K filing that [ORGANIZATION]2 lost another two million subscribers in fiscal year [LOCATION]1.

The application, titled Predicting household demographics based on image data, was originally filed [LOCATION]7, and made public [ORGANIZATION]7.86 [ORGANIZATION] Takes Aim at [ORGANIZATION]5, Calls for Congressional Oversight87 The head of billionaire [PERSON] foundation called for congressional oversight of [ORGANIZATION]5, after the social media giant finally took some responsibility for hiring a PR firm to smear its critics as agents of [ORGANIZATION]. So [ORGANIZATION]6 decides to drop a turkey on [LOCATION]8, with admission that [ORGANIZATION]7 was tasked by company leadership to target and smear [PERSON] because he publicly criticized their out of control business model. Sorry, but this needs independent, congressional oversight, [ORGANIZATION]8 head PERSON9 tweeted on [ORGANIZATION]8 night.88 [ORGANIZATION]0 advanced case of PERSON80 Derangement Syndrome Have you listened to the news broadcasts of [ORGANIZATION]9 or ORG[ORGANIZATION]3 lately? Almost 100 of the air time on those stations is devoted to [ORGANIZATION]1 and anti-Republican bashing, its like no other news is happening in our country and around the world. You could, in all honesty, call those media outlets, ORG[ORGANIZATION]4 A Giant Mammal Relative The Fossils of [ORGANIZATION] at ORG[ORGANIZATION]1 in [LOCATION] have discovered the fossils of a new species of dicynodont, a giant mammal relative. During [LOCATION]9 DATE[ORGANIZATION]3, mammal-like reptiles called therapsids co-existed with the ancestors of dinosaurs, crocodiles, mammals, pterosaurs, turtles, frogs, and lizards. The dicynodonts are one group of therapsids.92 Brits [ORGANIZATION] the Mainstream Media and Its Presenters, Report [PERSON] newsreaders have seen the biggest fall in trust over DATE[ORGANIZATION]4 a new report shows. The likes of news pundits [ORGANIZATION]2, [ORGANIZATION]3 and [ORGANIZATION]4 saw the biggest fall in DATE[ORGANIZATION]4, with trust declining FIVE percentage points from 67 in DATE[ORGANIZATION]1 to [TIME]. The ORG23 report says trust in TV news hosts to tell the truth has fallen by five per cent. Journalists also are revealed to be among the five least-trusted professions, coming above only ad executives, politicians and government ministers. They have dropped by one per cent over DATE[ORGANIZATION]4 and are DATE23 trusted by 26 per cent of people to tell the truth, the survey found.94 [PERSON] to [PERSON]3? Our Goal is Not to Sanction [ORGANIZATION], Commissioner Says95 On [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]5, ORG25 Commissioner, said that a deal could be found on the Italian budget rejected by ORG26 as the door is always open. The Commissioner stated Our door remains open and I am convinced that we will be able to find an accord on shared solutions in the interest of the Italians and the eurozone.96 [PERSON]s [ORGANIZATION]6 Report [PERSON] for Its Anti-Migration Stance97 Hungarians are clearly concerned about national identity and security issues related to migration when it comes to the future of [DATE], an official of ORG28 said on [PERSON]. At a series of consultations on the future of [ORGANIZATION] organised by [PERSON]5, the Hungarian government gave a briefing concerning the views of ordinary Hungarians at forums held in eleven Hungarian cities sent to the [ORGANIZATION]an Council, [ORGANIZATION]7, state secretary for [ORGANIZATION], told a press conference.98 [PERSON]5 Revolts Against [ORGANIZATION]8 Rioters in Violent Clash With Police in Tax Fury99 Access to the French [INSTITUTION] ring [STREET] and FAC2 was blocked with out of control hooligans ran onto the [STREET], alongside yellow vest protesters demonstrating against the French Presidents plans to hike fuel duty in the country. In the melee, police called to secure the area scuffled with protesters, causing a traffic nightmare, a police source told ORG30 in DATE24 of action from the yellow vests  so-called after the high-visibility safety jackets drivers are required to carry in their cars. The source said These incursions are criminal and irresponsible  they are acts of vandalism.100 [ORGANIZATION]9 [PERSON] Over Farages Interest in [PERSON][ORGANIZATION] After Coup Launch101 PERSON[ORGANIZATION]3 has announced that he will be writing to ORG32, [PERSON][ORGANIZATION] partys ruling body, asking them for a vote of no-confidence in [PERSON][ORGANIZATION] Leader [ORGANIZATION]9 over PERSON[ORGANIZATION]4 appointing PERSON[ORGANIZATION]1 as [ORGANIZATION] on rape gangs and prison reform.102 Hungarian Government Defends [ORGANIZATION]3 Asylum103 The immigration and asylum office did not make any mistake and the information it provided concerning the asylum case of former [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]4 was precise, professional and legitimate, the interior minister told the press on [ORGANIZATION]8.104 Income Inequality, [ORGANIZATION] and the Rise of [ORGANIZATION]s Far Right105 Citizens around the world are seeing their national wealth concentrated into fewer and fewer hands. But rather than calls for redistribution, this global trend has prompted many electorates to respond with a surge of support for the far right. Income inequality has increased in nearly all regions of the world over the past four [ORGANIZATION], according to [ORGANIZATION] [LOCATION]1. Since [DATE], the global top 1 percent of earners has experienced twice as much of the global growth as have the poorest 50 percent. While these ratios differ markedly between geographic regions with the least disparity in Western [ORGANIZATION] and the most in LOC2, the trend toward concentrating wealth among the rich remains constant. And although the bottom half has also experienced gains from global growth overall, the bottom 50 percent received just 10 percent of global income in DATE27 versus the [ORGANIZATION]3 percent that went to the top 1 percent. 106 [PERSON]3 Braced for Wrath of [ORGANIZATION]5 [PERSON]6 ORG30  [PERSON]3 coach [ORGANIZATION]6 concedes his side are braced for a [ORGANIZATION]7 against [ORGANIZATION]8 challenge against world champions [PERSON]7 in their final DATE28 Test on DATE29 at FAC3. The All Blacks arrive in [PERSON]8 having lost 16-9 to [PERSON]9 in GPE[ORGANIZATION]3 [ORGANIZATION]end, a further wake-up call for the worlds top team after a defeat by the ORG34 back in [ORGANIZATION]1. But even if [PERSON]7s aura of invincibility has started to wane [ORGANIZATION]2 out from the World Cup, [ORGANIZATION]9 is expecting another rough ride from a side the Italians have never beaten in 14 previous meetings. 108 Low Sentence for [PERSON] Who Raped Two [ORGANIZATION]02less [PERSON] for [TIME] in Belgian Hotel109 Four men with African backgrounds have received a relatively short sentence for the rape of two Dutch girls in GPE[ORGANIZATION]4. The girls, aged [ORGANIZATION]3 and [ORGANIZATION]4, were visiting the city of GPE[ORGANIZATION]1 during [ORGANIZATION]5 in [ORGANIZATION]6. In a nightclub they met PERSON30 and PERSON31, both of African heritage.110 PERSON32 [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION] to Hand National Sovereignty Over to GPE23111 German Chancellor [PERSON] PERSON32 has said that [ORGANIZATION]an [ORGANIZATION] member states must be prepared to transfer powers over to GPE23 at a debate on the tensions between globalisation and national sovereignty. Nation states must [ORGANIZATION]7 be prepared to give up their sovereignty, PERSON32 said, speaking at an event organised by ORG36 in GPE24 on [ORGANIZATION]8. In an orderly fashion of course, PERSON32 said, explaining that  while GPE25 had given up some of its sovereignty in order to join the [PERSON], national parliaments were in charge of deciding whether to sign up to international treaties. Comment When will each nations public wake to that fact their puppet politicians are traitors to their own countries?112 More Than 10,000 Women and Girls in [LOCATION] Have [ORGANIZATION] health watchdog ORG37 says that there is a significant risk for girls in [LOCATION] to be subjected to genital mutilation. ORG37 data shows that more than 10,000 girls and women living in [LOCATION] have already undergone the barbaric procedure.114 [ORGANIZATION]  is Not Nationalism  it is Socialism!115 WIKI National Socialism German [PERSON], more commonly kDATE23n as Nazism n??tsi?z?m, nt-, is the ideology and practices associated with [ORGANIZATION] or NSDAPin Nazi GPE25 Note the words [ORGANIZATION]1 in the [ORGANIZATION]2 partys name. Both words throughout history described parties of the political left, of communism, socialism, and fascism, [ORGANIZATION] of the political right. You will never find socialist or workers appended to the names of any party on the right or the political center. What they had in common was, they all imposed CHANGE on their citizens with the promise of [ORGANIZATION]. The [ORGANIZATION] never materialized. The change always did. What followed was poverty, misery, and millions of dead. GPE27 avoided that bullet DATE28 8th, DATE27.116 GPE28 is Both Pro-[ORGANIZATION]an and [ORGANIZATION], Prime Minister Says117 Polish Prime Minister [PERSON] and GPE25s Federal Minister of Finance and Vice Chancellor PERSON35 together took part in a discussion in GPE29 entitled A [ORGANIZATION]an Perspective for [ORGANIZATION] Swedish Electoral System119 The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]4 has criticised [LOCATION]s electoral system noting voter privacy concerns, missing ballots, and the [STREET] in which unions fund ORG[PERSON]1. The report, released on [ORGANIZATION]8, examines concerns raised following the Swedish national election in [ORGANIZATION]1 by [ORGANIZATION]4 elections observers who raised concerns over undemocratic aspects of the Swedish electoral system.1[ORGANIZATION]3 PERSON36 Plotting to [STREET] a Stake Through the Vampire of the [PERSON] With Election Plan1[ORGANIZATION]4 The mastermind behind PERSON37 presidential campaign explained he believed there will be chaos as right-wing and populist groups continue to rise throughout the [PERSON]. He said It will be like the intensity of [LOCATION] which came over like a [PERSON]0 storm. Currently, Mr PERSON38 is preparing to support right-wing and populist parties participating in the [ORGANIZATION]an [ORGANIZATION] elections [PERSON]1 The [PERSON]s Political Correctness and Censorship Will Backfire  Hungarian Prime Minister123 In a [PERSON] morning interview with [ORGANIZATION]7, the Hungarian Prime Minister criticised migrant debit cards, political correctness and censorship in [ORGANIZATION]. PERSON39 said he was surprised by the handing out of migrant debit cards. The issue of the migrant debit cards came as a surprise even for weather-beaten veterans like me, the Prime Minister [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]an [STREET] of Human Rights Submits to [LOCATION] The [ORGANIZATION]an [STREET] of Human Rights ruled on [PERSON]2 that to state that the Islamic prophet [PERSON]0 liked to do it with children and  A [DATE] and a [PERSON]3? What do we call it, if it is not paedophilia? goes beyond the permissible limits of an objective debate, and could be classified as an abusive attack on [PERSON]1 which could stir up prejudice and threaten religious peace. The [ORGANIZATION]9 judgment has a long history.126 PERSON[ORGANIZATION]1 Appointed [PERSON][ORGANIZATION] Advisor on Prison [ORGANIZATION] and Rape Gangs127 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION] leader [ORGANIZATION]9 has appointed PERSON[ORGANIZATION]1 as [ORGANIZATION] On Rape Gangs ...ison [ORGANIZATION]. The [PERSON][ORGANIZATION] Member of the [ORGANIZATION]an [ORGANIZATION] for [PERSON]0 said I have appointed PERSON[ORGANIZATION]1 to be a personal special adviser on two subjects which he has great kDATE23ledge.128 [PERSON]1 Companies Consider Microchipping Employees129 A number of companies in [PERSON]2 are considering mass microchipping their employees, a move that is raising concerns about the possible monitoring of [PERSON]1 residents. At least two microchip firms  the [PERSON]1s [ORGANIZATION]1 and [LOCATION]s [ORGANIZATION]4  have reported that they are working with several major British companies to insert the tiny, hidden information and tracking devices into the bodies of employees. The rice-grain sized chips are inserted between the thumb and the forefinger of employees, and are used by companies to ensure security at facilities and to store employee data. However, critics note that the chips can also be used to track individuals and to monitor their personal information without permission. The [PERSON]1 Independent reported that the use of microchips has become popular in [LOCATION], where more than 4,000 people have had chips implanted beneath their skin over [PERSON]4 through [ORGANIZATION]4. A partnership with the Swedish national railway system means people are able to use the [ORGANIZATION]4 chips as a replacement for paper tickets and plastic travel cards. [ORGANIZATION]4 said that it is presently negotiating with a number of [PERSON]1 legal and financial companies, which want the chips implanted in employees to tighten up on security. These companies have sensitive documents they are dealing with, [ORGANIZATION]4 founder [PERSON]2 told the [PERSON]1 [ORGANIZATION]5. The chips would allow them to set restrictions for whoever. [PERSON]3 added that in a company with [ORGANIZATION]30,000 employees, you can offer this as an opt-in. If you have a 15 percent uptake, that is still a huge number of people that wont require a physical ID pass. But critics fear that should companies gain momentum with the chips, they could do away with opt-in and require employees to take the chip. Comment No one should opt in. Let this satanic test run fail.130 [PERSON] 50m to [ORGANIZATION], Yet Still Zero Convictions for Cutters and Enablers at Home131 The British government has pledged an extra 5o million in foreign aid to stop female genital mutilation [ORGANIZATION] globally  while the [PERSON] has failed to convict a single person despite thousands of victims reported [LOCATION]0ly.

Teenagers met at a computer club to swap and play [PERSON] games. The state watched with [PERSON] [PERSON]5ian Law Allow for Child Abuse?139 Creating laws to protect children from sexual abuse continues to be a difficult process in [PERSON]5. Abuse cases are rarely publicized in the country, although [PERSON]5 is a signatory of the [ORGANIZATION]9 convention on child rights. In a recent case in [PERSON]5, a victim anonymously posted a story on [PERSON] of abuse he experienced at the hands of a teacher [PERSON]7. He was able to find support on social media from people who had similar experiences of abuse. He was inspired to finally share his story only after he saw a case of sexual abuse publicized in a news report from the southern [PERSON]5ian city of [PERSON]6. A gardener with psychiatric problems reportedly molested children and took pictures of his victims. A journalist published the pictures in the report. [PERSON]7, Big Shot in the LOC3, Carried Out for [ORGANIZATION] has done a big hit obtaining a share of 25 of a large offshore concession of three fields in [PERSON]7. [DATE] ORG60 signed an agreement with the company of [PERSON]7, [PERSON]8 which provides for a share of 25 per cent in a mega offshore concession, the [PERSON], which includes three fields per trillion cubic meters of gas. When fully operational, writes [PERSON]8, the wells will be able to produce up to 1,5 billion cubic meters of gas per day and 1[ORGANIZATION]3 thousand barrels of high-value condensates. This is how ORG60s CEO [PERSON]9 confirms the confidence in our upstream model, based on the integration of exploration and development. [PERSON]7 has chosen the Italian company because it guaranteed a rapid transition from exploration to production, as was successfully done in [PERSON]9 with the [ORGANIZATION] gas field, the FAC5 . ORG60 then signed an agreement with the [ORGANIZATION] company, ORG62 the sovereign fund ORG62 is interested in the construction of the ORG63 drone P.2HH, for the sale of [ORGANIZATION]3 per cent of the ORG60 share in the [ORGANIZATION] concession, off [PERSON] in [PERSON]9. [PERSON]9 and GPE40, however, always writes the press, have signed an agreement to bring GPE40i gas on the [PERSON]9ian coast, where, in GPE41, there is a large plant for liquefaction of ORG64 that could become a hub for transport to all [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON], in all this business, is not watching and PERSON50 intends to set up a military base in [PERSON]9 and probably also in GPE43. ORG60 and [PERSON]3 can thus counter the French expansion from the [PERSON], where gigantic deposits of gas exist yet to be explored and thus restore equilibrium in the Libyan LOC7. What is certain is that with this agreement the negotiations for the construction of the ORG63 drone should also be unblocked, ensuring the continuation of the Italian companys activities and the retention of the seats of 1[ORGANIZATION]30 workers. ORG65 has put in [STREET] a new drone, the P.2HH, with the aim of selling it to both the emirates and [LOCATION] for a cost of 766 million euros that should be taken over by the Italian government and paid in [PERSON]9 , for the development and purchase of [ORGANIZATION]3 aircraft and 10 ground stations. The same sum would be assured by [PERSON]7. The slowdowns in the funding of the program had annoyed and not a little [PERSON]7 that would have sensitized Italian politicians and soldiers so that PERSON51 could enter ORG65 as soon as possible.142 [PERSON] PERSON52 Claims He Was a Volunteer Nurse and Didnt Fight  as Details of His Squalid Cell Are Revealed While He Awaits Death by Hanging in GPE[PERSON]1143 GPE44 terrorist PERSON52 who has been sentenced to death in GPE[PERSON]1 is being held in a crammed prison cell while he tries to whitewash his history with [PERSON] Says [PERSON] Overstepped Brief by Calling for Kurdish Leaders Release1[PERSON]1 GPE47 ORG30  Turkish Foreign Minister [PERSON] on [PERSON] accused [DATE]s top diplomat of overstepping her brief by calling for the release of jailed Kurdish leader [PERSON].

ORG73 ...[PERSON] were boycotted by the three Chinese giants in the sector, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION].com and [ORGANIZATION], cross-border operators ORG79 and [ORGANIZATION]0, and luxury e-commerce companies such as [ORGANIZATION]1, [ORGANIZATION]2 and [ORGANIZATION]3, media outlets and shopping platforms said. Due to the row, ORG73 ...[PERSON] on [ORGANIZATION]8 had to call off a major show in [PERSON]1, just [TIME] before it was scheduled to begin, as several celebrities said they would not be attending. Meanwhile a [PERSON]2 government official said [ORGANIZATION] that the clamor about the advertising campaign that has offended many people in [PERSON]0 must not become a diplomatic case. That is not a diplomatic question and I wont let it become a diplomatic question, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson PERSON59 told a press conference when asked about the case. The controversy arose after videos posted on the Italian fashion brands ORG75, [ORGANIZATION]5 and [PERSON] accounts, as well as its [ORGANIZATION]5 profile in [PERSON]0. In the first video published on [PERSON]5, a young model in a red dress attempts to eat pizza with chopsticks. She prods the pizza to the sound of stereotypical Chinese music, before a narrator offers advice such as just use your chopsticks like pliers. In the second and third episodes of the campaign, the same model tries to eat a cannoli and a bowl of spaghetti and this time the narrator appears to mispronounce the brands name, with some seeing this as a [STREET] of poking fun at the Chinese pronunciation of ORG73 ...[PERSON]. Also, a voiceover asked is it too big for you? while the model attempted to eat cannoli. The videos sparked a social media outcry [ORGANIZATION]5 users accused the label of trivializing the countrys culture and depicting Chinese women in a racist and sexist [STREET]. The young woman in the video was said to have a stereotypical naive appearance with small eyes, and she was described using double entendres. The video for The Great Show was taken down within [PERSON]6 but it had already been shared widely on social media, where the hashtag [PERSON] began to circulate. In addition, PERSON60 was quoted as describing [PERSON]0 as a foul-smelling, dirty and ignorant mafia in private ORG75 comments that the recipient made public. The messages quickly went viral on social media The fashion house has said its account and that of PERSON60 had been hacked and denied posting the messages. We are very sorry for any distress caused by these unauthorized posts, the company said on its ORG75 account. We have nothing but respect for [PERSON]0 and the people of [PERSON]0. On his personal account, PERSON60 pasted the words not me over images of the alleged derogatory comments.

[ORGANIZATION] refineries are running at less than a quarterof their capacity, forcing the country to rely on imported gasoline. Once the cargoes are unloaded at import docks, smaller ships distribute fuel to terminals along the coast, where its loaded on trucks to refuel inland stations.

Its not the picture of women and children that the mainstream media wants to portray see video below.

Four of the migrants were rushed to hospital with hypothermia while the others were handed over to border police in the nearby border town of GPE65, a major hub for migrants.178 GPE25 Sets Out New Law to Find Skilled Immigrants179 The German government is slowly delivering on its promise to hash out a new immigration law to fill the massive gaps in the market for skilled labor. But experts say the law can only do so much. GPE25 is short of nurses, care workers, construction workers, carpenters, electricians, and IT specialists. And businesses have long been demanding that the government make it easier for skilled workers, including those from outside [DATE], to move to GPE25  notwithstanding a political climate that has become toxic for many immigrants. German unemployment is currently at a low, with only 2.2 million out of work. And according to [ORGANIZATION]8 of ORG95, some 60 percent of businesses say that the lack of employees is a threat to their growth. 180 [PERSON]3 Whistleblower Who Reported Migrant Transport NGO Smuggler Links Lives in Fear After Death Threats181 A former member of security staff for a migrant transport NGO in [PERSON]3 has received death threats after blowing the whistle on allegations that the NGO had been cooperating with people traffickers.

Theyre an invading army, posing as refugees seeking asylum because they fear being killed, seeking illegal entry into GPE68. Who and what the migrants are was the bone of contention that led to PERSON82 temporary suspension from the ORG98 press room. PERSON80 had called them an invasion force of illegal aliens. [ORGANIZATION] said they were refugees. PERSON80 was right. The spokesman for an open borders group trying to push the migrants into GPE68 said they intend to storm the border and force their [STREET] into the country.

A second [ORGANIZATION]9 agreement on refugees is also DATE23 under fire, with the far right saying it will facilitate an unregulated refugee influx. There are currently around 68 million displaced people worldwide, according to ORG99. Most of those are internally displaced, still in their own country but driven from their homes. But some 25 million have fled across borders and entered neighboring countries, or to countries further afield. [ORGANIZATION]8 after the passing of [LOCATION] on refugees in [ORGANIZATION]9, these figures are at a record high.

That wasnt all speaking to reporters at his [ORGANIZATION]03 resort in [LOCATION], GPE4, the president said on [ORGANIZATION] that he also signed an order to close the [PERSON]7 border with GPE70, adding that hes authorized troops to use lethal force against migrants who attempt to enter the [PERSON]7 If they have to, PERSON80 told reporters at his [ORGANIZATION]03 resort in [LOCATION], GPE4, claiming that at least 500 criminals are among migrants trying to enter the [PERSON]7 So Im not going to let the military be taken advantage of. I have no choice. Do I want that to happen? Absolutely not. But youre dealing with rough people. PERSON80 also said that he would welcome a partial shutdown of the government over border security. According to [ORGANIZATION]04, PERSON80 signed the order [PERSON]1 and that Ive already shutdown parts of the border warning that the entire border may be closed if conflict with migrants escalates. If we find that its uncontrollable, he said, if we find that it gets to a level where we are going to lose control or people are going to start getting hurt, we will close entry into the country for a period of time until we can get it under control. The whole border, he clarified. I mean the whole border. And GPE70 will not be able to sell their cars into GPE68 where they make so many cars at great benefit to them, not at great benefit to us. Still, details were missing as the ORG98 hasnt released the order and PERSON80 wasnt clear about his directive.194 [PERSON] Two Migrant Boats Land in GPE72 as [ORGANIZATION] Surge195 Two dinghies carrying 14 illegal migrants have been picked up by the coastguard near [LOCATION].

baltimore,2016-08-18T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,WBAL,housing crisis,"Slick, [ORGANIZATION] Off","The campaign demonstrated that despite a changing society increasingly consumed by social media and online video, television remains a potent, persuasive force, even for disruptive tech giants like [ORGANIZATION]. The record [ORGANIZATION] campaign spending  which totaled 27.8 million for all measures and candidates  also offers a preview of what is expected to be an even bigger media onslaught [LOCATION], as a presidential election draws more voters to the polls. In [DATE], multiple seats will be up for grabs at the citys ORG1, and at least one likely ballot initiative threatens the soda industry, which has a history of throwing big sums into local elections to protect its bottom line. By [PERSON], more than 6.4 million had been poured into TV advertising alone for five ballot initiatives and three candidate races [LOCATION]ositions A, D, E, F and I, as well as the contests for mayor, sheriff and [ORGANIZATION]. The vast majority of that money went to defeating [LOCATION]osition F2, which tried unsuccessfully to expand regulations on short-term rentals of homes and apartments. The ORG13 campaign, funded chiefly by [ORGANIZATION]-based [ORGANIZATION], outspent proponents on television 45-to-1, buying [TIME] of opposition advertising for [TIME] of [ORGANIZATION] ads, based on a [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] review of TV advertising, which included national and local stations. Shaped by national political consultants, the big-money campaigns created an echo chamber, aided by local broadcasters. Superficial TV reporting parroted claims in the ads, which were notable for distorting or obscuring facts, attacking a candidates character or conjuring menacing images of Big Brother intrusions into peoples bedrooms and personal information. Misrepresentations big and small pervaded the airwaves Claims inaccurately attributed to the official ballot initiative text of [LOCATION]osition F An attack on ORG2 challenger [ORGANIZATION], who was seeking to regain his old seat from the supervisor [PERSON] had installed. The ad portrayed the ORG1 former president  and mayoral foe  as an aggressive [TIME] caller A questionable claim that [ORGANIZATION]s 310 million housing bond, [LOCATION]osition A, would not cost taxpayers anything. Campaign ad makers arent interested in accurate sources, but they want those facts in there, they want a newspaper quote, they want some sort of backup information, said [ORGANIZATION], co-author of [ORGANIZATION]. They might cite some sort of voting records, but youre not going to get the exact citation that would let you easily track down the information, he said. Its a feature of our ads  theres too much info in politics [PERSON] to fact-check all of this. To PERSON3, that information overload poses a challenge to democracy. Organized groups are sending out information at light speed, and in a sense this is a crisis of journalism, he said. How to help voters sort through it. Analyzing the Ads The [ORGANIZATION] collaborated with [ORGANIZATION], a [ORGANIZATION]-based nonprofit that catalogs electronic media worldwide, to analyze 27 distinct TV spots that aired on 11 stations during the fall campaign. We looked closely at five [ORGANIZATION] stations that accounted for more than half of the airtime for the ads and virtually all the televised news coverage of the election ORG7, [ORGANIZATION], ORG9, ORG10 and [ORGANIZATION]. Ads also ran on Chinese-language station ORG12 but were not reviewed. All told, [TIME] of ads ran on these five stations from after DATE5 until [ORGANIZATION], compared with a total of [TIME] of TV news coverage  a ratio of about 7-to-1. Of the total ad time, ORG13 dominated with [TIME], compared with [TIME] for the Yes effort  a 76-to-1 imbalance. By far the most contentious citywide issue was [PERSON] by ORG14, the initiative tried to toughen the ordinance, passed and signed in [LOCATION], that legalized short-term rentals and established a system of registration and taxation. Though renters still widely outnumber homeowners in [ORGANIZATION], many from both groups are united in the opportunity to reap windfalls from short-term rentals, even though they may contribute to rising costs and the overall housing crisis. The campaign to defeat [LOCATION]osition F pitted [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], real estate interests, tech venture capitalist PERSON5 and some labor unions against tenant activists, neighborhood groups, hotel unions and wealthy property owners, who were badly outgunned and outspent on all media. [ORGANIZATION] led the ORG13 television blitz, ponying up 4.7 million in TV buys alone to beat back broader control of its business model, according to city data. The Yes campaign mustered only about 104,000 for television, and about 1.1 million overall. All told, [ORGANIZATION] spent more than 9 million to be victorious. That number has been exceeded only once since [ORGANIZATION] began reliably tracking campaign finances online in [LOCATION] when [PERSON]...pent 11 million to defeat a renewable-energy measure in DATE9. The campaign had all the modern bells and whistles you would expect of an effort backed by a [PERSON] giant, ORG13 consultant [PERSON], co-founder of ORG16, wrote in the online journal ORG17ections7 in [LOCATION]0. Casting doubts on [LOCATION]osition F Crucial to victory were several slick, 30- and [TIME] TV spots that skillfully  if misleadingly  sowed doubts about [LOCATION]osition F. To craft more than a dozen complementary TV ads, [ORGANIZATION] for Everyone  ORG13, funded primarily by [ORGANIZATION], turned to noted Democratic strategist [PERSON] ....8 Based outside [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], the firm has deep ties to the party and top Democrats, including Vice President [PERSON], Gov. [PERSON] and state Attorney General [PERSON]0. [PERSON]1 worked on [PERSON]2 [LOCATION]1 campaign against President [PERSON]3. [PERSON]4 sister, [PERSON]5, is the firms executive vice president. [PERSON] has also handled media campaigns for ORG18 and other corporate heavyweights. It boasts that it has not lost a ballot initiative in [LOCATION]2. Following the firms much admired playbook  9 Principles of Winning Campaigns9  ORG13 proponents worked to create uncertainty about the measure before going in for the kill. We start with the simple notion that campaigns cannot move a No to a Yes or vice versa, [PERSON] declared. You must first move initiative voters to undecided. Only then can you persuade them the rest of the [STREET]. Vice President [PERSON]6 has called [PERSON]1 the preeminent storyteller who makes voters want to listen. In [LOCATION]3, a poll by ORG19, which was hired by the ORG13 campaign, showed public opinion was almost evenly divided. In [LOCATION]4, ORG13 cranked up the volume, running [TIME] of ads, about 60 percent on local stations. The Yes campaign was silent, airing not a single spot [LOCATION]5, the [ORGANIZATION] analysis found. The barrage paid off, according to [ORGANIZATION] polling in mid-[LOCATION]4. No led by 16 points. After [LOCATION]7 our No vote jumped to a dramatic double-digit lead while the Yes vote dropped like a rock, [PERSON]s website said. In [LOCATION]. F, we focused on a broad theme that the proposal was just too extreme, [PERSON]7, senior vice president of [PERSON], told the [ORGANIZATION]. Strategically, we had undermined the Yes on [LOCATION]. F before our opponents could react. That made it ultimately impossible for them ever to fully recover or to ever regain the lead. The ORG13 blitz hammered home the idea that the measure was just too extreme, a new threat that would violate peoples privacy, encourage spying on your neighbors and result in thousands of new lawsuits. The ads capitalized on growing concerns about privacy, personal rights and government intrusion following revelations that ORG23 was amassing phone and email data on Americans in its efforts to thwart terrorism. [ORGANIZATION] and his predecessor, Lt. Gov. [PERSON]8, smoothly reinforced the themes that the measure goes too far and is just too extreme. [ORGANIZATION] with five supervisors, the Democratic and Republican parties, [PERSON] and others, they trumped a long list of influential [ORGANIZATION] backers that included Sen. [PERSON]9 former mayor [ORGANIZATION]0 five city supervisors Democratic clubs teachers, nurses and hotel workers unions tenants rights groups and neighborhood associations. The [STREET] people learn is through endorsements, said [ORGANIZATION]1, a political scientist at [ORGANIZATION] State University who specializes in urban politics and voting behavior. People are generally skeptical of ballot propositions if there is opposition. Thats the endorsement thing. Its not the ad, its the endorsements, he added. You can spend a lot of money to make those endorsements obvious, or that conflict obvious. Then people are skeptical and it fails to pass. Leave spying to the movies Beyond endorsements, memorable [PERSON] spots turned to the dark side to cast [LOCATION]osition F as a sinister ORG25 effort to monitor residents bedrooms and create personal dossiers. One depicted a creepy neighbor peering through night-vision-like binoculars at Victorian houses, followed by images of aerial surveillance video and a data scan of a palm print. Lets leave the spying to the movies, not the neighbors, the narrator said over a [ORGANIZATION]3 soundtrack of surf guitar. Another spot showed shadowy fingers on a laptop keyboard as the narrator warned that the initiative would allow the government to collect peoples private information. Voters were never told that the existing ordinance12 already required hosts to register with the [LOCATION] and maintain [LOCATION]8 records of their residency and rentals, thereby compelling them to share certain private information demonstrating primary residency, the number of [DATE] they occupied their unit, and the dates and the duration of each short-term rental. As it stood, [LOCATION]9 ordinance required that the city create a registry of short-term-rental hosts and that the information shall be available for public review to the extent required by law  with one exception to the extent permitted by law, ORG26 shall redact any [ORGANIZATION] names from the records available for public review. [ORGANIZATION] is not alone GPE4, [PERSON], officials may subpoena much more personal information to enforce the citys short-term-rental laws, including phone, tax, vehicle and real estate records. Another notable ad was called Night, featuring the simple imagery of a half-asleep woman between crisp white sheets. What if the government required you to report when youre sleeping in your own home, or even in your own bed? a gravelly male voice narrated over the tune Lullaby and Goodnight. If [LOCATION]. F passes, [ORGANIZATION] will be the only city in the country where residents will be forced to do just that. The ominous warnings in both ads were attributed to the Official Text [ORGANIZATION] Measure F and ORG27  a nonprofit advocacy group listed as an ongoing client of [ORGANIZATION]4, the media buyer for ORG13. MANIPULATION AND MESSAGING The truth, however, was something else. Nowhere in the official ballot text15  which amended the existing code covering short-term rentals  did it require hosts using [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION] or ORG29 to report when they were sleeping in their own homes or beds. [LOCATION]osition F reiterated the language from the ordinance backed by [ORGANIZATION], approved by supervisors and enacted in [DATE]0 [LOCATION]8 reporting of the number of [DATE] a primary residence was occupied and [DATE]1 it was rented out. No bed checks. Consider that if you go out of town for [DATE]2 or [DATE]3, you are still considered to be legally occupying your home or apartment, even if you were away or let friends or family occupy it in your absence. Certainly, not all [ORGANIZATION] residents read the official ballot text or the new ordinance that took effect [DATE]4. The initiative just went further, too far for a majority of voters who turned out. Some of the most controversial provisions called for cutting [DATE]5 short-term rentals from [DATE]6 to [DATE]7 banning use of in-law units tightening registration and reporting, and bolstering the neighbor complaint process and enforcement by bringing [ORGANIZATION] and its rivals into the process. Additionally, residents would have needed permission to operate as a bed and breakfast for rentals beyond [DATE]7 [DATE]. The ORG13 campaign apparently persuaded many voters to believe that it would be the ballot measure that would make already existing provisions law. And [ORGANIZATION] disguised two of its biggest concerns, which it had fought to keep out of the ordinance [ORGANIZATION] signed in [LOCATION]. Not surprisingly, the No campaign did not point out that the [LOCATION]osition F would have required [ORGANIZATION] and its competitors to closely monitor listings and remove illegal units and those that had been rented out for more than [DATE]7 [DATE] over [PERSON]6 [PERSON]0. Failure to do so could have resulted in fines up to 1,000 a day per listing, potentially costing [ORGANIZATION] and the others tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars. [LOCATION]osition F also would have cleared the [STREET] for residents and other interested parties  neighbors and landlords among them  to directly sue [ORGANIZATION] and its competitors, which under the current law can be done only by [ORGANIZATION]0. The opposition took no chances on finding the most potent message. Yes ads were also created to test against focus groups watching No spots, said [ORGANIZATION]5, of [PERSON]. There was one ad we produced to test for the yes side that would have likely won the race for them had they aired it, he said, without revealing the ads content. Our opponents greatest strength was the simplicity of their message  the housing crisis  and, frankly, they swung and missed. The [ORGANIZATION] campaign mustered only one TV ad. It claimed that illegal [ORGANIZATION] hotels were evicting thousands of GPE6 from their homes and causing rents to skyrocket, citing news articles in the [ORGANIZATION] Examiner and [ORGANIZATION]2. Neither article contained the ads wording, however, and its claims have not been established conclusively. Nearly three-quarters of [ORGANIZATION] units are covered by rent control, and it is illegal for landlords to evict tenants and begin renting to visitors. Although evictions jumped [PERSON]1, [ORGANIZATION]3 reported, it is not known whether the units were subsequently rented out to visitors or to new long-term tenants at much higher market rates. In a [PERSON]2 report, the [ORGANIZATION] Budget and [ORGANIZATION] office estimated that [ORGANIZATION] listings may have been responsible for removing between 925 and 1,960 housing units from the residential market, based on data from [PERSON]3 and [PERSON]4. That could represent between 11 percent and 23.2 percent of the citys vacant housing units, the report said, noting that its estimates and conclusions were conservative and understate the full short-term rental market by an unknown amount. Regardless of the accuracy of the ads claims, it was virtually invisible compared with the No onslaught. For all of [PERSON]5, the Yes ad aired a total of only [TIME]. Ultimately, the ORG13 ads epitomized the art of political persuasion and spin. Night earned industry recognition and awards18 for the campaign team  [PERSON], [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION] media buyer [ORGANIZATION]6, campaign manager [ORGANIZATION]7 and senior adviser [ORGANIZATION]8, [ORGANIZATION]s head of global policy and public affairs and an adviser in the [ORGANIZATION]9 [PERSON]1 [ORGANIZATION]. TV was not the only vehicle the campaign used to drum up opposition to F, however. We sent 16 pieces of mail to a universe of approximately 100,000 households and made sure it mirrored the content of the TV ads, wrote PERSON30, of [ORGANIZATION]-based ORG16. We put up massive campaign billboards around town using the same binocular image of the spying neighbor that voters saw in the TV ads and in their mailboxes. And we ran a robust online campaign led by [ORGANIZATION]8 to reach those same voters digitally. We also ran one of the most aggressive field campaigns [ORGANIZATION] has ever seen, she added. Over [PERSON]6 [PERSON]7, our staff and volunteers knocked on more than 300,000 doors, made some 300,000 phone calls and had over 120,000 conversations with real voters. Two key voting blocs were targeted Chinese-Americans, who she said disproportionately owned and occupied the in-law units that would be banned, and young voters, our largest group of supporters, though one with a historically low turnout in [ORGANIZATION] voting. [ORGANIZATION]s roughly 138,000 users in the city played a big role, PERSON30 explained, hosting house parties, organizing their friends and neighbors, and leading dozens of earned media events. In the end, [LOCATION]osition F was trounced, 56 percent to 44 percent. [ORGANIZATION] did not reply to questions about its ads. For privately held [ORGANIZATION], with an estimated value greater than 25 billion, the ads were money well spent in its hometown, the poster child for tight, expensive housing. The results demonstrated [ORGANIZATION]s popularity and growing influence in spite  or because  of the housing crisis. As the company extends its reach, driven by a new generation, technology and an economy in flux, the campaign may offer a blueprint for success. [PERSON] attack on PERSON31 ORG13 wasnt the only campaign that used a combination of well-funded research, technology and distortion to create a negative image. In the ORG2 battle, incumbent PERSON32 and her allies slightly outspent [PERSON] PERSON31 to try to prevent him from reclaiming his seat, which he had held from [PERSON]8 to [PERSON]9. In the end, the race cost 2.1 million, a record for a supervisorial contest, according to [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]122 data. [ORGANIZATION] Affordable [ORGANIZATION] Opposing PERSON31 for Supervisor [PERSON]0, backed mainly by PERSON34, spent 313,380 in the failed bid to take down PERSON31, according to [ORGANIZATION]1 filings. PERSON35 of [ORGANIZATION]2 was hired to create an anti-PERSON31 spot. He modeled it after the hit show Mad Men. [ORGANIZATION]3 used PERSON31s past behavior  notably instances of bad temper and apparent intoxication  to undermine his bid, albeit unsuccessfully. In the ad, [ORGANIZATION]3 cited a [ORGANIZATION] Chronicle column that had quoted [ORGANIZATION], criticizing PERSON31 for his reputedly aggressive behavior with his [ORGANIZATION]5 colleagues see The Most Misleading Political Ads of [PERSON]024. The mayor had appointed PERSON37 to a vacancy and was pulling out all the stops to get her elected to a full term. Taken out of context, the quote was, at best, misleading. As a creative guy, I have two messages, said [ORGANIZATION]3, whose work includes campaigns that elected presidents PERSON38 and [ORGANIZATION]9, and Sen. PERSON39. One, this is a candidate who has a history of drinking and going off on city employees, and two, Ive got a narrative about a throwback to the past  a former supervisor who had gotten out of office versus a new candidate. And while the ad didnt stop PERSON31  who had vacated the seat because of term limits  from winning the campaign, it presented him as an obstructionist, a characterization that [ORGANIZATION]3 believes will stick. His opponents should be emboldened from the campaign because it was such a narrow win, said [ORGANIZATION]3, whose [PERSON] won an industry award for the Best Ad for Independent Expenditure Campaign25. He added that bringing up PERSON31s previous mistakes forced him to express contrition about his past and pledge to operate differently. PERSON31s team fired back, hitting PERSON34s contribution to [ORGANIZATION]3s attack. [ORGANIZATION] billionaire [PERSON] says [ORGANIZATION] is a mad man, the rebuttal stated, as a segment of the Mad Men ad played in the background beside a photo of PERSON34 looking off into the distance. The spot claimed that PERSON34 had spent 128,250 to smear [ORGANIZATION]. PERSON31 regained his seat, handily defeating PERSON37 by 9 percentage points, a bitter defeat for the mayor, PERSON34 and their allies. Misleading claim for [LOCATION]osition A One other major measure also relied on misleading information to persuade voters. [LOCATION]osition A ads claimed that the mayors 310 million housing bond would not raise taxes. The Yes on A campaign ran [TIME] of ads on stations that aired in the [ORGANIZATION]. There was no opposition on TV. The claim that [LOCATION]osition A26 would not raise taxes was reinforced in a commercial narrated by [ORGANIZATION], who reassured viewers that the proposition would build critically needed homes for low- and middle-income GPE6 without raising taxes. But according to a [LOCATION]3 report from the city [ORGANIZATION]8 office27, the no-new-taxes claim would be nearly impossible to keep. The report states that if implemented, [LOCATION]osition A would cause the city to raise property taxes from [DATE] [PERSON]0-2016 through [PERSON]2 by an [DATE]5 average of 8.09 per 100,000 of assessed valuation, according to the city controllers best estimate. That would be an additional 89 [PERSON]0 for a 1.1 million dwelling, the median home price as of [PERSON]3. In the [ORGANIZATION]Internet Archive review of [LOCATION]osition A coverage, only one TV news segment we identified, Reality Check With Sam [ORGANIZATION]128 on [ORGANIZATION], addressed its discrepancies. For [TIME], [ORGANIZATION]1 deconstructed the ballot initiative, stating that [ORGANIZATION]s promise of no additional taxes was unfounded. The segment, which first aired [PERSON]4, was repeated [PERSON]5. It was the most comprehensive look at any of the [PERSON]0 propositions by the five news stations, our research found. Former ORG10 political reporter [ORGANIZATION]3, who worked on [ORGANIZATION] ads early in the campaign, said it has become more difficult to be a watchdog in the news environment of [PERSON] because of staff cuts at TV stations, increased competition from digital sources and a [TIME] news cycle. The stations are still profitable, but theyve got to feed the beast because their costs are higher, he said. That includes political reporters, who are more expensive than their general-assignment counterparts. They could spend more money on hiring staff but they dont, he added. Because news programs are driven by ratings and increasingly forced into short, simple formats, [PERSON] said, it is easier for a campaign to bamboozle voters. Whos there to police? he asked.  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28 start120end180  29"

At [TIME] on [ORGANIZATION], the [PERSON]2 man threw incendiary devices at the ORG6 detention center and nearby cars, setting one on fire. The male attempted to ignite a large propane tank and set out buildings on fire, a statement released by the [PERSON]0 [INSTITUTION] said. The male continued throwing lit objects at the buildings and cars. Four officers arrived at the scene and were involved in the shooting. Police initially called out to the man and then shots were fired. It remains unclear who began firing first. An ORG6 spokesperson confirmed that no employees were hurt at the shooting, according to ORG7. The man who attacked the ORG6 center has now been identified as [PERSON] of [PERSON]3, Washington.53 [ORGANIZATION] to Spark Global Grassroots Movement54 [PERSON]4 RNS  As he prepared for [ORGANIZATION] second summit on global religious liberty [LOCATION]0, [PERSON], the [PERSON] ambassador on religious freedom issues, defended the event against critics who say that the first summit failed to accomplish more than creating new statements about helping religious minorities.

The poll included 1,003 likely general-election voters who are white and have [LOCATION]3 of college education, reports [ORGANIZATION]2. The results validate the concerns of many Democrats that the party is moving too far left and losing moderate voters in the process.61 [PERSON]7 [ORGANIZATION]3 Manufactured the Case Against General [PERSON]8 The newest piece of information comes courtesy of [ORGANIZATION]4 in his piece, [PERSON]9 Case Highlights Multiple Insurance Policy Motives by [ORGANIZATION]5 and [ORGANIZATION]6 Operatives. Up to this point, I confess, I bought into the story that [PERSON] [PERSON]9 was working on behalf of [PERSON]7 and failed to register under the Foreign Agent Registration Act. In short, he was guilty of a FARA violation. But thats not the real story. [PERSON]9 was set up. What do I mean? There is no evidence that [PERSON] [PERSON]9 sought out Government of [PERSON]7 representative and asked to go to work for them. That has been the conventional wisdom. But it turns out that [PERSON]9 was not working for the Government of [PERSON]7. [PERSON]9s firm was hired by [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION]4. Here is what ORG21 reported in [LOCATION]5 As part of its contract with ORG22, the [PERSON]9 [ORGANIZATION] hired researchers to examine [PERSON]1, a reclusive Islamic cleric who lives in exile in rural [PERSON]8. [PERSON]2 has blamed [PERSON]3 opposition group for an attempted [LOCATION]6 coup and has sought his extradition. On [LOCATION]7, [PERSON] newspaper published a [PERSON]9 op-ed that called [PERSON]4 radical cleric and said the [PERSON] government should not provide him a safe haven. At least three possibilities exist with respect to the motive for producing this report-1 it was initiated by the Government of [PERSON]7 using [ORGANIZATION] as a cut out, or 2 [ORGANIZATION] was asked by someone linked to the [PERSON]5 Campaign or ORG25 to hire [PERSON]9s company to do the work, or 3 [ORGANIZATION] did this on its own. Regardless of the motive, what we now know is that ORG25, courtesy of either an [ORGANIZATION]6 FISA or the ORG26, was monitoring communications with [PERSON] [PERSON]9. The [ORGANIZATION]6 Director of ORG27, [PERSON]6, led the charge in pressing [PERSON]9 to file a belated FARA. That filing was then used as evidence that [PERSON]9 lied.63 Meet the Madam [PERSON]7 [PERSON] Spotlight on [PERSON]5-Linked Socialite64 Questions swirl around role of [PERSON]8 in [PERSON]7s trafficking crimes Following the arrest of pedophile financier [PERSON] [PERSON]7 last [ORGANIZATION], many outlets have turned their attention to his longtime confiante, socialite heiress [PERSON]8  who has been accused by three women of procuring and training young girls to perform massage and sexual acts on the [LOCATION]9 registered sex offender and his associates. [ORGANIZATION]1, [ORGANIZATION]0, comes from money. Her father was publisher Robert [ORGANIZATION]1  who himself faced accusations of being a ORG28 double and possibly triple agent and a bad character who was almost certainly financed by [PERSON]9, according to [LOCATION]. Robert [ORGANIZATION]1 died in [ORGANIZATION]1 when he fell from his yacht, the [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]3  however the circumstances surrounding his demise have been rife with speculation including that it was a ORG28 assassination  a theory which attorney and longtime [PERSON]7 associate [ORGANIZATION]4 slammed in a [ORGANIZATION]2 op-ed. It is unknown exactly how [PERSON]7 and [PERSON]8 met  however they reportedly dated [ORGANIZATION]3, shortly after her fathers death. After breaking up, they remained good friends. In [ORGANIZATION]4, [PERSON]7 renamed a now-defunct GPE20 company [ORGANIZATION]3 Corp, which was dissolved in [ORGANIZATION]5 per [PERSON]1. In [ORGANIZATION]2, [PERSON]7 described [ORGANIZATION]1 as his best friend, who was not on his payroll  yet seems to organize much of his life.65 Pushing Back Against Anti-[PERSON]nism66 For [DATE], Republicans and Christians have passively allowed leftists to infect our youth with anti-[PERSON]nism and instill a culture of glorified debauchery while systemically secularizing our government. All references of [PERSON]s Christian founding have been removed from public education. Historian [ORGANIZATION]5 is pushing back by publishing his [ORGANIZATION]. Democrats sought to destroy [ORGANIZATION]6, co-founder of [PERSON]2, for donating to [PERSON]s reelection campaign. Unlike most Republicans, [PERSON] pushed back. He boldly defended [ORGANIZATION]8 and [PERSON]2 with the following tweet67 Sexual Predators Within [PERSON]s Power Elite What Youre Not Being Told68 Politics, religion, sports, government, entertainment, business, armed forces it doesnt matter what arena youre talking about, they are all riddled with the kind of seedy, sleazy, decadent, dodgy, depraved, immoral, corrupt behavior that somehow gets a free pass when it involves the wealthy and powerful elite in [PERSON]. In this age of partisan politics and a deeply polarized populace, corruption  especially when it involves sexual debauchery, depravity and predatory behavior  has become the great equalizer. Take [PERSON] [PERSON]7, the hedge fund billionaire  convicted serial pedophile recently arrested on charges of molesting, raping and sex trafficking dozens of young girls. It is believed that [PERSON]7 operated his own personal sex trafficking ring not only for his personal pleasure but also for the pleasure of his friends and business associates. According to [PERSON]3, several of the young women.say they were offered to the rich and famous as sex partners at [PERSON]7s parties. At various times, [PERSON]7 ferried his friends about on his private plane, nicknamed [ORGANIZATION]. This is part of [PERSON]s seedy underbelly. As I documented in the in-depth piece I wrote [ORGANIZATION]7, child sex trafficking  the buying and selling of women, young girls and boys for sex, some as young as 9 DATE34 old  has become big business in [PERSON]. It is the fastest growing business in organized crime and the second most-lucrative commodity traded illegally after drugs and guns.69 Stunning Video Maps Out All of the 4,000 [ORGANIZATION] by [PERSON]4 Since [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION]8 [PERSON]4 has released a stunning visualisation of all the exoplanets it has ever spotted, including those from dedicated world-hunting crafts [LOCATION] and TE[ORGANIZATION].

The incredible visualisation of where each exoplanet is in the night sky was made by [PERSON]4 using data from [PERSON]5, a science outreach project.71 Terrorist Who Firebombed ORG6 Facility Wrote in Manifesto I Am [ORGANIZATION]072 The terrorist who firebombed an ORG6 facility in [PERSON]2 DATE31 released a manifesto before the attack stating, I am [ORGANIZATION]0 and said the attack was motivated by his opposition to concentration camps in the [PERSON] [PERSON] was shot dead by police after he threw Molotov cocktails at the building and nearby cars on [TIME].

And the elite trembles. [PERSON]7 had already been condemned on similar charges in the past but had got off with a light sentence thanks to a plea deal brokered by former [LOCATION] attorney and current [PERSON]6 Secretary [ORGANIZATION]ander [PERSON]2. [PERSON]2 is now being highly criticized for the decision and is facing calls to resign. Besides [PERSON]2, [PERSON] is also being accused of entertaining relations with [PERSON]7 whom he praised in a declaration DATE32 [PERSON]7 [PERSON]9 Account Aimed at Supporting [PERSON]3 Suspended Without Explanation76 [PERSON]7, of the biggest [PERSON]9 accounts aimed specifically at supporting [PERSON]8 founder [PERSON]3, has been suspended from [PERSON]9 without any explanation.

Now the German defense minister needs to win over a majority of ORG40 to secure the presidency of [ORGANIZATION]. She remains an enigma to many, but is hoping some high-profile advisers can help change that. By [PERSON]6, [PERSON]7 and [PERSON]8 [PERSON]5, who is currently being shielded from journalists like a pop star from groupies, is taking a break in front of F[ORGANIZATION]1 in [PERSON] [LOCATION]an Quarter. She repeatedly throws her arms around. Now I need a bit of movement, she says. It is [TIME] on DATE33, and the aspiring president of [ORGANIZATION], the [ORGANIZATION] executive, is on her [STREET] to her hotel after [TIME] at her desk and phone. It is cold this late in the evening, and the center-right Christian Democrat [LOCATION] politician is wearing only a pink cardigan. But the cold doesnt seem to bother her. [PERSON]9 is bursting with energy, and gushes about her new job The young people working for the transition team, the languages, the international surroundings. After her DATE34 at the head of the stiff and scandal-plagued ORG44 in GPE25, [PERSON]0 seems like she has been liberated. In her steep political ascent, she was often protected by people at the very top, but now she has to fight for herself, and conduct a campaign on her own  or almost alone, given the small, occasionally colorful flock of advisers at her side79 [PERSON] Warning [ORGANIZATION]0s [PERSON] is Just Dress Rehearsal for Vulnerable GPE26  Expert80 THE [ORGANIZATION]0ROPEAN [LOCATION] has shot itself in the foot with its attempts to strong-arm GPE27 into signing up for a wide-ranging agreement covering financial services  but [PERSON] is likely to try a similar strategy when it comes to GPE28 as [PERSON] looms, a senior economist has predicted.81 GPE29 [PERSON]0 Has First Fireworks Show Since [LOCATION]6 Terror Attack82 The first firework display in [PERSON]0 since the terrorist attack of [DATE] [LOCATION]6 has taken [STREET] in celebration of DATE36 ORG45.

The [ORGANIZATION]1 data, published on [PERSON]6, predicts that the population of the [ORGANIZATION]0 as a whole will decline rapidly after peaking at 525 million in [PERSON]7, falling to 492.9 million by [PERSON]8. If correct, it means the Polish population has already peaked at 38 million and will steadily decline to 27.5 million in [PERSON]9 losing over a quarter of its population.89 Publish [PERSON]6 Name on [ORGANIZATION]2 and Youre Out in [PERSON]390 Since [PERSON]7 was convicted for defying [STREET] order, [ORGANIZATION]2 introduced a ban about [PERSON]8  all sharings of links regarding the dangerous person, would result in closed accounts. In [PERSON]3, it is enough to write his name on the social media platform to become banned for as long as up to DATE50. One who published a [ORGANIZATION]2 note about [PERSON]7, was journalist [PERSON]9, editor for the podcast Ingrid and [PERSON].

The sources added that investigators want to know whether the cell had planned any operations outside [PERSON]7 while they were here. The sources said after confiscating the groups laptops, mobile phones and documents, state security detectives are currently examining and analyzing them to prepare a complete case file. The sources said the terrorist group had been tracked down after state security received tips from local and foreign sources, including suspects arrested in [PERSON]8, concerning the cell members and the danger they pose due to their military training. A statement by the interior ministry on [LOCATION]2 carried by the state-run news agency [ORGANIZATION]8 said the militants were allegedly members of a terrorist cell, including some who have been convicted of terrorism and sentenced to jail in [PERSON]8. Those arrested carry [PERSON]8ian nationalities and belong to the [ORGANIZATION]7 organization, the ministry said. The suspects, it said, are wanted by [PERSON]8 where some of them have been sentenced to up to 15 DATE34 in jail. During interrogations, the suspects admitted to carrying out terrorist operations in [PERSON]8. Investigations are ongoing to determine their accomplices, the statement said, warning that it will crack down ruthlessly against saboteurs. [PERSON]8ian authorities have led a crackdown on [ORGANIZATION]7 members after the military overthrew Islamist president PERSON63 in DATE53. DATE54 [PERSON]8 outlawed the [ORGANIZATION]7 and declared it a terrorist organization.

No action taken so far. PERSON64  Haridwar  [LOCATION], [PERSON] This is very embarrassing that a ORG61 Monk and devotees were attacked, assaulted and humiliated in F[ORGANIZATION]5 in GPE41 Station by [PERSON] as provoked by two Muslim women, while returning from [PERSON]. But, there is no time for the [LOCATION] Railway Minister, [ORGANIZATION] Minister and GPE42 Chief Minister, anyway. ORG61 is a internationally famed philanthropic organization which is mostly renowned for its relief work in any calamity or disaster with various social welfare activities as run by the organisation. A Hindu monk who is in charge of the GPE43 branch of the ORG61 in [LOCATION] and nine other devotees returning from the [PERSON] yatra, including three women, were allegedly beaten up by a group of ORG64 personnel at GPE41 station on DATE56 past DATE57 midnight. PERSON65 popularly known as PERSON66 and some of the devotees lodged a complaint with ORG65 in GPE45 on DATE57 and have also tweeted to [LOCATION] railway minister [PERSON] and GPE46 chief minister PERSON68 about the incident. But, any reaction, intervention or appropriate steps yet to be reported unfortunately. We boarded the GPE45-bound [ORGANIZATION] from GPE47 on [TIME] and all of us had reservations in an [ORGANIZATION] coach. Two Muslim women named PERSON69 and [ORGANIZATION]0 in reserved seat no 26 and 28 in no coach no 13 with another two Muslim women requested us to let them sit in our berths. We agreed, PERSON65 said. According to the monk, at [TIME], they asked the women to sit in their reserved seats, as some elderly persons with the monk extremely needed some rests. Surprisingly, their behaviour changed all on a sudden and they refused to vacate the berths. They also threatened us that we would be taught a lesson when the train reached GPE41. One of them claimed that her husband was a senior government official in [ORGANIZATION]n [ORGANIZATION] IRPS. We did not get into any further argument and accommodated ourselves in the remaining berths, said PERSON659798 Terrified ORG68 Hi-Fi Workers Detail How Teenage Gangs Are Targeting Their Stores in Swarming Rip and Run Theft Rampages99 Thieves have increasingly swarmed stores across GPE48 taking costly items in a rip and run manner, with [ORGANIZATION] as the hottest commodity.100 GPE49 Mayor Were Not Going to Cooperate in ORG6 Raids101 GPE49s mayor announced [LOCATION]2 that his city would not be the one to cooperate in a series of targeted immigration enforcement raids taking [STREET] on [ORGANIZATION]. Were not going to cooperate, said Democrat GPE49 Mayor [ORGANIZATION]2, who spoke [LOCATION]2 at a protest rally outside F[ORGANIZATION]7, according to a report from [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON]1 is one of ten cities in the [PERSON] that the [PERSON] Immigration and Customs Enforcement ORG6 targeted for deportation raids that would expel anyone in the [PERSON] not in the country legally.102 Democratic Governor [PERSON] for Leftist Who Firebombed ORG6 Facility103 Yes, really The Democratic Governor of [PERSON]2 believes there is one person to blame for an incident in which a far-left activist tried to firebomb an ORG6 facility President [PERSON]. Governor [PERSON]1 was responding to the attack, during which [PERSON], who was armed with a rifle, was shot dead after throwing Molotov cocktails at the building and nearby cars. [PERSON]2 was an [ORGANIZATION]0 activist and reportedly wrote a manifesto explaining the motives behind the attack. However, according to presidential candidate [PERSON]3, President [PERSON] is to blame. [PERSON]3 said [PERSON] was intentionally trying to create anxiety and fear among undocumented families. He also tried to deliberately mislead people about the nature of the attack by claiming it is unknown whether [PERSON]2 was targeting detainees or staff, when it was established almost immediately that the incident was an anti-ORG6 attack.

More and more it seems Democrats are the party of the Anti-Christ. 104 [ORGANIZATION]0 Should Charter Migrant Flights, Says Italian FM105 ORG71 foreign minister has called for recent problems posed by mass migration to be solved within a [LOCATION]an framework. [PERSON]2 has borne the brunt of a huge influx of migrants to [LOCATION] that erupted in DATE58. ORG71 foreign minister on [ORGANIZATION] unveiled a raft of proposals aimed at restructuring the [ORGANIZATION] response to a migrant crisis that has strained relations between [PERSON]2 and its [ORGANIZATION]0 neighbors. Asylum applications should be filed at [ORGANIZATION]0 centers located outside the bloc, [ORGANIZATION]4 told [ORGANIZATION]s Corriere della Sera newspaper. Those deemed eligible for asylum would be flown on chartered flights into the bloc, bypassing people traffickers and perilous sea journeys, the minister suggested in the interview. Those who have the right to asylum must be able to travel in dignified conditions, not in the hands of criminals, he said. 106 Final Death Toll in Boat Migrant Accident Off [PERSON]3 Rises to [DATE] [PERSON]4 Reuters  The number of bodies recovered by [PERSON]3 after a ship packed with migrants sank off its coast DATE59 has risen to 82, in one of the worst disasters in recent DATE34, the [PERSON]3nRed Crescent said on [ORGANIZATION].

[ORGANIZATION]5, the illegal alien turned himself into law enforcement officials and has since been charged with causing a deadly hit-and-run and driving without a license.110 PERSON80 Struggles to [ORGANIZATION] On ABCs The View, Sen.

I believe, as an immigrant, I probably love this country more than anyone that is naturally born and because I am ashamed of it continuing to live in its hypocrisy. We export [PERSON]n exceptionalism, the great [PERSON], the land of liberty and justice. If you ask anybody walking on the side of the [STREET] somewhere in the middle of the world they will tell you, [PERSON] the great, but we dont live those values here. That hypocrisy is one that I am bothered by. I want [PERSON] the great to be [PERSON] the great. Of course, there was no question asking what she means by hypocrisy. PERSON81 just spews rhetoric against her adopted country with political grandstanding thats sickening. Comment She is in love with the [ORGANIZATION] in her mind, not the constitutional Republic of [PERSON].114 Reports ORG6 Has Begun Raids to Round Up Undocumented Migrants115 Immigration authorities have begun conducting raids, a senior administration official said [ORGANIZATION], in an operation expected to target about 2,000 undocumented migrants ordered by courts to be removed from the country.

A 7th grade refugee student in [PERSON]1 broke his teachers jaw recently. The boy was searched for a knife when he broke the female teachers jaw.120 Syrian Refugees in [ORGANIZATION]8 Forced to Demolish Their Own Homes121 by PERSON86 Demolish your home or well do it for you. This, in a nutshell, is the ultimatum that was given to the Syrian refugees living in camps in the village of [ORGANIZATION]9, northeast of GPE70. [ORGANIZATION]8, the Lebanese army demolished at least 20 concrete settlements in three Syrian refugee camps in the village, but before the ORG78 intervention, several refugees had taken the matter in their own hands and had already destroyed their own homes. The demolitions follow a decision by [ORGANIZATION]8s Higher Defence Council in DATE5 to take down refugee structures made of any material other than plastic and wood. According to the head of the [ORGANIZATION]9 municipality, PERSON87, the order applies to 3,500 to 3,600 refugee families in [ORGANIZATION]9122 PERSON88 Rips Into [ORGANIZATION]s Censor Squad as [ORGANIZATION] PERSON90 called Rep.

[ORGANIZATION] a living fire alarm of the danger of welcoming immigrants who hate [PERSON]. It was certainly a hot take, and it underlined once again that the liberal elites  the ones who claim to love democracy and free speech  will not tolerate criticism of PERSON81 PERSON90 responded in kind on DATE56 PERSON92 Needless to say, the Left went berserk[ORGANIZATION] and her allies in [ORGANIZATION]0 immediately demanded that this show be pulled off the air. They didnt rebut what we said, any of our points or even acknowledge them. They just tried to silence us. Thats how they operate. And of course they called us racist. On one level thats amusing given how absurd the charge is. This show more than any other show on television has taken an aggressive position in favor of colorblind equality and against racism, particularly the casual racism of the modern world left. We despise the current habit of judging people on the basis of their skin color. Its wrong. We say that virtually [TIME]. Racist? No. Were against racism, adamantly. PERSON81 consistently puts her own race at the center of the conversation, but to us, its irrelevant. PERSON93, for example, would by the standards of identity politics by PERSON81s standards seem to have everything in common with [ORGANIZATION]. Like PERSON81 she was born in [PERSON], moved to [LOCATION] and eventually came to this country. Unlike PERSON81, PERSON95 loves and cares about [PERSON]. She believes our country is superior to the country she came from and she says that. For saying that, the left despises her. PERSON81s friend PERSON96 once tweeted that PERSON95 deserves to be mutilated for her beliefs. So two Somali immigrants, one among the most impressive people in [PERSON], the other among the least, its not about race. But of course PERSON81 and her friends already know that. Nothing they say on the subject race is sincere. Its all a hustle designed to get them what they want. PERSON81 has made a career of denouncing anyone and anything in her [STREET] as racist. That would include virtually all of her political and personal opponents. It includes even inanimate objects like the proposed border wall, thats racist. So is [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]0, so is the entire state of GPE72, she once tweeted.124 [ORGANIZATION] Brainwashing by fake news, universities and establishment culture leads to this [PERSON] reporter PERSON97 interviews leftists protesting upcoming ORG6 deportation raids set to begin [ORGANIZATION], and tries to make sense of their twisted logic that stems from fake news and emotion-driven narratives.

In its 7-4 decision, the [ORGANIZATION]1 ruled in favor of allowing the [PERSON] administrations [ORGANIZATION] rule to stand while a [ORGANIZATION]5 lawsuit against it makes its [STREET] through the courts.128 [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION],  Says [ORGANIZATION]6 [PERSON], which takes [STREET] in [ORGANIZATION] with only animal characters, is specifically depicting a white supremacist society Well, it was bound to happen. One of the woke writers at [PERSON]3 found something political to nitpick about [ORGANIZATION]7 remake of [PERSON]. Rather than let everyone enjoy one of childhoods great classics, PERSON98 tried to burst the bubble, pointing out how its a fascistic story that incorporates the white supremacists worldview. Good grief.130 GPE73 [STREET] Orders Father to Raise His Son as a Transsexual131 With DATE71 it seems more like we are simply in a battle between the forces of good and the forces of evil A GPE73 father has been legally prohibited from raising his son as a boy because his ex-wife allegedly decided their son is a transgender girl and is preparing him for chemical castration at DATE72 and a future sex change surgery, which the father may be forced to help pay for.

GPE75-based journalist PERSON99 filed a fear-mongering report for the GPE74s [ORGANIZATION]8 newspaper DATE33, Activists condemn Canadian cinema chain for screening anti-abortion film [ORGANIZATION]9 criticized for screening Unplanned, which is said to promote falsehoods about reproductive health. Previously, the movies producers said the pro-life film had been effectively banned in GPE75 due to several prominent Canadian distributors, including ORG90, refusing to pick up the film because of its pro-life content. ORG90 has evidently changed its mind and will now run the film. Now the left-wing GPE74 paper is furious at the cinema chains audacity to actually screen a movie with a premise liberals find to be suffused with wrongthink the few liberals that have actually bothered to watch it, anyway, rather than condemning it sight unseen.
