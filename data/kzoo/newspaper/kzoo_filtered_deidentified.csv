In total, 64.1 percent of the Swiss agreed to marriage for all, with the proposal receiving the support of more than half of the citizens in all 26 cantons. The result, according to the [ORGANIZATION] agency, is not surprising. [PERSON] parliament approved same-sex marriage DATE80, but a trio of nationalist and Christian-conservative parties, which collected enough signatures to hold the referendum on the issue, disagreed. Proponents of same-sex marriage say that approving the law will put heterosexual and same-sex couples at the same level in areas such as children adoption, obtaining citizenship after marriage, and regulated sperm donation, the ORG85 agency wrote. 166 ORG86 CEO Says Celebrating [PERSON] is a Core Value167 ORG86, whose policies and the [STREET] it implements them are more and more often at the center of massive political controversies at home  has chosen to address one that recently happened abroad.

In a matter of [TIME], the traffic stop turned into a foot chase a high-risk behavior increasingly discouraged in police reform circles, a struggle, and ultimately, an execution. While pinning [ORGANIZATION] down and kneeling on his back, [ORGANIZATION] fatally shot [ORGANIZATION] in the back of the head1. DATE0, on [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION] prosecutor PERSON3 announced murder charges against [ORGANIZATION], in a rare2 but welcome turn of events. This is an important development in the fight for greater accountability for police use of deadly force. Over DATE2, local leaders and activists have kept up the pressure. [ORGANIZATION] like the [ORGANIZATION] Association of Pastors, which includes the support of nearly 70 local pastors from across denominations3 the [ORGANIZATION] ORG2, the Black civil rights organization and other local leaders have been pressing authorities for transparency, accountability, and police reform in [ORGANIZATION]. The [INSTITUTION] there has been under investigation since [ORGANIZATION] by ORG3. In his [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION] argues that [ORGANIZATION]s use of deadly force cannot be characterized as self defense. The defense disagrees, saying [ORGANIZATION]s murder was justified.6 The [ORGANIZATION] family will now have to endure the lengthy and painful legal battle ahead. Perhaps [ORGANIZATION]s mission trip to Kenya7 is irrelevant to this latest example of [ORGANIZATION] lethal problem of over-policing of Black communities. But we should acknowledge the cruel irony of a [LOCATION] dressed in bluewho dressed like an African for his Christian mission weddingpinning down a Congolese refugee and fatally shooting him in the back of the head in the name of self-defense. Not only was PERSON10 [ORGANIZATION] the victim of a violent reality in [PERSON] where Black people are nearly three times as likely to be killed by police than white people8. He was also the victim of [PERSON]n austerity economics where policing stands in as a response to the defunding of social [PERSON] and resettlement means acculturating to the impossible mathematics of pulling oneself up by their bootstraps without a safety net. Born in GPE4, [PERSON], [PERSON] PERSON10 [ORGANIZATION] lived for [PERSON] in the [ORGANIZATION] refugee camp10 in GPE7 the camp receives 300 new arrivals on average [ORGANIZATION], the majority from the [PERSON] before being resettled with his family in [LOCATION], [PERSON] state capital, at [ORGANIZATION]. According to [LOCATION], PERSON8 and Dorcas [ORGANIZATION] worked odd jobs, and the family of eight shared a small apartment when they first moved to [PERSON]0. PERSON10 [ORGANIZATION] later moved to [ORGANIZATION] where he moved between family and friends homes and where he most recently worked on the factory floor of an auto manufacturing plant. Not long before he was killed, PERSON10 had just moved into his own [STREET], a milestone for the [PERSON] refugee. According to people close to him, [ORGANIZATION] worked hard to take care of his family. He wanted to buy or build a home for his mother as part of his quest to achieve a comfortable middle-class [PERSON]n life. He was also a father of two and an active member of the Congolese community, where he was known to help new arrivals find their footing. [ORGANIZATION] attended [ORGANIZATION], where Pastor PERSON11, also a refugee who resettled in the [PERSON]1, remembered him as a hard working young man who tried to make his future better.12 As much reporting has highlighted, PERSON10s life was complicated. According to Pastor PERSON13 of [PERSON]2, [PERSON]3,13 who lived in GPE7 as a refugee with the [ORGANIZATION]s, PERSON10 sometimes worked three jobs to support himself and his family. But existing media profiles have highlighted PERSON10s legal troubles dating back to DATE8 without meaningfully reflecting on the ways in which resettlement policies intersect with anti-Black biases in [DATE] that [STREET] refugees like PERSON10 firmly into a violent cycle of over-policing and under-resourcing of Black immigrant lives. In [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]3, has become an important [STREET] of resettlement for refugees from the [PERSON]. According to one [LOCATION], [DATE] of [ORGANIZATION], 319 out of 490 refugees who resettled in [PERSON]0 were Congolese. And according to resettlement agency ORG7, [ORGANIZATION] was becoming the no. 1 place15 that Congolese refugees requested for resettlement as part of the process of secondary migration by which refugees seek to follow or reunite with family members through the resettlement process. As of [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] was home to about 8,000 refugees from the [PERSON] and 11 Congolese churches. However, national resettlement numbers have significantly declined in [ORGANIZATION], particularly under the former PERSON14 administration. This has meant that social services have also been slashed. Resettling in the [PERSON]1 is exceptionally hard, as sociologist PERSON15 shows in her new book that details [PERSON]n resettlement policies and their implications for Syrian refugees. Resettlement in [PERSON] relies heavily on the notion of self-sufficiency, treating newcomers as [PERSON]n low-income workers and denying them crucial services for integrating into [PERSON]n economic and social life. But the story doesnt end there. Where state and federal support services fall short, the growing Congolese refugee community in [PERSON]0 has been working hard to uplift and support its members. Pastor PERSON16 who was close to PERSON10 runs a nonprofit called African Community [PERSON]217. It gained official nonprofit status in [ORGANIZATION], formed to cater to the needs of all [PERSON], African refugees in [PERSON]2 County, [PERSON]0 and by extension, [PERSON]5. Also, we promote the unity of [PERSON], and support the development of our host community. Among their services, African Community [PERSON]2 works to ensure members of the community have adequate access to food, translation, and interpretation services for non-English speaking immigrants and refugees within the community. You can make a donation to their cause here18. According to their website, they are currently working to open a childcare center and provide help with finding affordable housing solutions for its community members. They are also looking for volunteers and donations of household goods, including food and diapers. PERSON10 [ORGANIZATION] was involved in this work, too19work that the refugee community is doing to improve the lives of those whom [PERSON]n resettlement practices have failed to protect and uplift. Now, in light of the recent tragedy that has struck the refugee and Black community of [ORGANIZATION], PERSON10s father, PERSON8, cautions20 those who may be thinking about seeking asylum in the area I want to say for those people who are seeking asylum here, refuge, I dont want you to think this is a safe [STREET]. I thought it was a safe [STREET], but it seems like we are in danger even when we come here. As [ORGANIZATION] speakers, the [ORGANIZATION]s have relied on translators for interviews. It is unclear from media reports how strong PERSON10s English skills werebut ORG10 reporting7 indicates that language was a barrier for him, possibly even in his encounter with [ORGANIZATION] on [LOCATION]1. [LOCATION]2, [PERSON]0 banned [ORGANIZATION] and Spanish dictionaries in its prisons, claiming that the books contents are a threat to the states penitentiaries.21 But this move begs the question how many among the growing Congolese population in [PERSON]0 are landing in the prison system? Statistics are not readily available. However, data compiled by [ORGANIZATION] shows that while Black people make up 15 of [PERSON] population, they make up 53 of the states prison population and 37 of its jail population. According to The ORG10,7 PERSON10 [ORGANIZATION] had spent some time in and out of jail. And according to some readers comments, PERSON10s legal troubles seem to justify his murder, which is a sad reflection of how too many [PERSON]ns uncritically think about crimeviolent and nonviolentas a reflection of the individual more than as a reflection of [ORGANIZATION] austerity economics and deepening social divides. PERSON10 [ORGANIZATION]s case has drawn national attention. The Reverend PERSON18 eulogized PERSON10 at his funeral on [LOCATION]3, and PERSON10s parents hired well-known civil rights attorney PERSON19.

As the nation takes [LOCATION] to memorialize its military dead, those who are living are facing a deadly risk that has nothing to do with war or conflict the coronavirus.Different groups face different degrees of danger from the pandemic, from the elderly who are experiencing deadly outbreaks in nursing homes2 to communities of color with higher infection and death rates3. Veterans are among the most hard-hit4, with heightened health and economic threats from the pandemic. These veterans face homelessness, lack of health care, delays in receiving financial support and even death.I have spent DATE2 studying veterans with substance use and mental health disorders who are in the criminal justice [PERSON]. This work revealed gaps in health care and financial support for veterans, even though they have the best publicly funded6 [PERSON] in the country.Here are eight ways the pandemic threatens veterans 1.

kzoo,2020-05-22T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,WWMT,homeless,8 ways the coronavirus is more dangerous for veterans,"The largest group served in [ORGANIZATION], where 2.8 million veterans were exposed to Agent Orange9, a chemical defoliant linked to cancer.Younger veterans deployed to [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] were exposed to dust storms, oil fires and burn pits with numerous toxins10, and perhaps as a consequence have high rates of asthma and other respiratory illnesses11.Age and respiratory illnesses are both risk factors for [ORGANIZATION] mortality. As of [LOCATION], there have been 12,979 people under [ORGANIZATION] care with [ORGANIZATION], of whom 1,100 have died. 2. Dangerous residential facilities [ORGANIZATION] needing end-of-life care, those with cognitive disabilities or those needing substance use treatment often live in crowded [ORGANIZATION] or state-funded residential facilities.State-funded soldiers homes are notoriously starved for money and staff. The horrific situation13 at the soldiers home in GPE2, [PERSON], where more than 79 veteran residents have died from a [ORGANIZATION] outbreak14, illustrates the risk facing the veterans in residential homes. 3. Benefits unfairly denied A transition clerk assists a Reservist with his ORG2 Form 214 as part of the demobilizing process, at FAC0, [DATE]. [PERSON] When a person transitions from active military service to become a veteran, they receive a [ORGANIZATION]. This certificate provides information about the circumstances of the discharge or release. It includes characterizations such as honorable, other than honorable, bad conduct or dishonorable. These are crucial distinctions, because that status determines whether the [ORGANIZATION] will give them benefits16.Research shows that some veterans with discharges that limit their benefits have PTSD symptoms, military sexual trauma or other behaviors related to military stress. [ORGANIZATION] from [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] have disproportionately more17 of these negative discharges than veterans from other eras, for reasons still unclear18.The [ORGANIZATION] frequently and perhaps unlawfully19 denies benefits to veterans with other than honorable discharges.Many veterans have requested upgrades to their discharge status. There is a significant backlog of these upgrade requests20, and the pandemic will add to it, further delaying access to health care and other benefits. 4. Diminished access to healthcare [ORGANIZATION] surgery, routine visits and elective surgeries at [ORGANIZATION] medical centers have been postponed since [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] hospitals are understaffed21 - just before the pandemic, the [ORGANIZATION] reported 43,000 staff vacancies out of more than 400,000 health care staff positions. Access to health care will be even more difficult when those medical centers finally reopen because they may have far fewer workers than they need.As of DATE4, 2,250 [ORGANIZATION] health care workers22 have tested positive for [ORGANIZATION], and thousands of health care workers are under quarantine. The [ORGANIZATION] is asking doctors and [PERSON] to come out of retirement to help already understaffed hospitals. 5. Mental health may get worse [ORGANIZATION] and military personnel at a military job fair in GPE4, [PERSON], [PERSON]. ORG5 An average of 20 veterans die by suicide [ORGANIZATION]. A national task force24 is currently addressing this scourge.But many outpatient mental health programs are on hold or being held [LOCATION]. Some residential mental health facilities have closed26.Under these conditions, the suicide rate for veterans may grow. Suicide hotline calls by veterans were up by 12 on [ORGANIZATION], DATE8 into the [LOCATION]. 6. Complications for homeless veterans and those in the justice system An estimated 45,000 [PERSON] are homeless on any given night, and 181,500 veterans29 are in prison or jail. Thousands more are under [STREET]-supervised substance use and mental health treatment in veterans treatment [DATE]. More than half31 of veterans involved with the justice system have either mental health problems or substance use disorders.As residential facilities close to new participants, many veterans eligible to leave prison or jail have nowhere to go. They may stay incarcerated or become homeless.Courts have moved online32 or ceased formal operations altogether, meaning no veteran charged with a crime can be referred to a treatment [STREET]. It is unclear whether those who were already participating in a treatment program will face delays graduating from [STREET]-supervised treatments.Further, some veterans treatment courts still require participants to take drug tests33. With [ORGANIZATION] circulating, those participants must put their health at risk to travel to licensed testing facilities. 7. Disability benefits delayed ORG6 veteran [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], shakes hands with Filipino World War II veteran PERSON1, 100, during [LOCATION]0 ceremonies at the American cemetery in [LOCATION], GPE7, [LOCATION]1. PERSON2 In the pandemics epicenter in [LOCATION], tens of thousands of veterans34 should have access to [ORGANIZATION] benefits because of their low income - but dont, so far.The pandemic has exacerbated existing delays in finding veterans in need, filing their paperwork and waiting for decisions. PERSON3, an attorney in [LOCATION]s Legal Assistance Group, a nonprofit legal services organization, noted in a personal communication that these benefits are worth tens of millions of dollars to veterans and their families in the midst of a health and economic disaster.All 56 regional [ORGANIZATION] offices are closed35 to encourage social distancing. Compensation and disability evaluations, which determine how much money veterans can get, are usually done in person. Now, they must be done electronically, via telehealth services in which the veteran communicates with a health care provider via computer.But getting telehealth up and running is taking time, adding to the longstanding [ORGANIZATION] backlog36. Currently, more than 100,000 veterans37 wait [LOCATION]2 for a decision. That is what the [ORGANIZATION] defines as a backlog - anything [LOCATION]3 is not considered a delay on benefit claims. 8. Economic catastrophe There are 1.2 million veteran employees in the five industries most severely [ORGANIZATION] by the economic fallout of the coronavirus.A disproportionately high number of post-911 veterans live in some of the hardest-hit communities that depend on these industries. [ORGANIZATION] returning from overseas will face a dire economic landscape, with far fewer opportunities to integrate into civilian life with financial security.In addition, severely disabled veterans living off of [ORGANIZATION] benefits were initially required to file a tax return to get stimulus checks39. This initial filing requirement delayed benefits for severely disabled veterans by [LOCATION]4. The ORG8 finally changed the requirements40 after public outcry, given that many older and severely disabled veterans do not have access to computers or the technological skills to file electronically.There are many social groups to pay attention to, all with their own problems to face during the pandemic. With veterans, many of the problems they face now existed long before the coronavirus arrived on GPE9 shores.But with the challenges posed by the situation [LOCATION]5, veterans who were already lacking adequate benefits and resources are now in deeper trouble, and it will be harder to answer their needs.Editors note This is an updated version of a story41 that originally ran on [LOCATION]6 knowledge, [LOCATION]7.
