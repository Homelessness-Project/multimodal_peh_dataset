Bidens initial statements as president reinforced those expectations. In his inaugural address, the new president stressed that We will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again. A month later, Biden amplified that goal and applied it with special emphasis to Washingtons relationship to its European allies in his speech to a virtual version of the annual Munich Security Conference. He stated that Im sending a clear message to the world America is back. The transatlantic alliance is back. And we are not looking backward we are looking forward, together. He added The partnership between Europe and the United States, in my view, is and must remain the cornerstone of all that we hope to accomplish in the 21st century, just as we did in the 20th century. In an unmistakable slap at his predecessor, Biden acknowledged that I know the past few years have strained and tested our transatlantic relationship, but the United States is determined  determined to reengage with Europe, to consult with you, to earn back our position of trusted leadership. The sense of relief in European circles after the Trump years was almost palpable. Biden gave exactly the speech that many Europeans wanted to hear, wrote Germanys influential Der Spiegel magazine. It was a widely shared sentiment on the Continent. In the aftermath of the chaotic and humiliating departure of U.S. forces from Afghanistan, and the reaction of European governments to that episode, the presidents promises and confident hopes of transatlantic unity have been shaken to their core. Armin Laschet, a leading German politician, described the situation in especially harsh terms. This is the greatest debacle that NATO has seen since its foundation, and it is an epochal change that we are facing, he stated bluntly.  74 MasterCard Used Its Dominance to Dictate Online Platform Rules, Then Launched Its Own Digital ID System to Capitalize on it75 Back in April, Mastercard, one of the worlds biggest credit card companies, imposed a new policy on who can use its services, specifically around illegal adult content.

Last years total was more than 8,400, meaning this years figure to date double the 2020 total. 154 Over 95 Per Cent of Afghans In Greece Arrive Without Documents Ambassador155 The ambassador of Afghanistans former Western-backed regime to Greece had admitted that over 95 per cent of supposed Afghan migrants in the EU member-state arrive without documents. Mirwais Samadi, who remains in Athens in something of a limbo situation while the Taliban remain officially unrecognised as rulers of Afghanistan  but how long that will go on for, no one knows  made the admission in an interview with the leftist Guardian, in which he decried the right-leaning Greek governments efforts to discourage illegal migrant flows from the Islamic emirate. 156 Poland Says it Found Evidence of Extremism on Migrants Phones157 WARSAW Reuters  Polands interior minister said on Monday material related to Islamic extremism had been found in the phones of migrants crossing its border with Belarus and he called for a 60-day extension to a state of emergency along the frontier. 158 UK Importing Foreign Drivers to Solve Shortages Caused by Reliance on Cheap Labour is Folly Migration Watch159 Migration Watch UK has slammed the British government for turning to thousands of foreign drivers to solve shortages which they believe were caused by bosses addiction to cheap overseas labour in the first place. This problem has been years in the making. Neither party has seen the benefit of training and retaining UK workers rather than taking the cheaper option of foreign drivers, lamented Alp Mehmet, chairman of the migration sceptic think tank, in comments sent to Breitbart London, of the shortages, which have caused widespread panic-buying of fuel despite industry assurances that there is enough supply to meet demand at British refineries and terminals. 160 Video Texas Students Agree With Biden Border Policy, Until They See the Pictures161 Video shot by Campus Reform reveals students at the University of Texas campus in San Antonio lauding Joe Bidens immigration policies, right up until they are shown pictures of thousands of migrants living in squalor under a bridge in Del Rio. Thats more than I was expecting, one student said, with another proclaiming That  I do believe its a problem. 162 Video Even CNN Calls Out Patently False Border Patrol Whipping163 After a week of the Biden administration and Democrats pushing fake news that border patrol agents whipped migrants, and even removing them from duty, even CNNs Jake Tapper described the story as patently false during an interview with DHS Chief Alejandro Mayorkas. Some of the initial descriptions of those images were just patently false, Tapper said, adding Theres now video out there that provides more context. 164 Swiss Voters Approve Same-Sex Marriage in Referendum165 In a Sunday referendum, the Swiss voted to legalize same-sex marriages, the DPA reported. In total, 64.1 percent of the Swiss agreed to marriage for all, with the proposal receiving the support of more than half of the citizens in all 26 cantons. The result, according to the AFP agency, is not surprising. Switzerlands parliament approved same-sex marriage last year, but a trio of nationalist and Christian-conservative parties, which collected enough signatures to hold the referendum on the issue, disagreed. Proponents of same-sex marriage say that approving the law will put heterosexual and same-sex couples at the same level in areas such as children adoption, obtaining citizenship after marriage, and regulated sperm donation, the AP agency wrote. 166 YouTube CEO Says Celebrating Freedom of Speech is a Core Value167 YouTube, whose policies and the way it implements them are more and more often at the center of massive political controversies at home  has chosen to address one that recently happened abroad. CEO Susan Wojcicki has spoken about the removal of videos of opposition figure Alexey Navalny in Russia, after the Russian government requested this. 168  1 470775  2 470685  3 470707  4 470683  5 470719  6 470735  7 470773  8 470741  9 470666  10 470759  11 470729  12 470709  13 470715  14 470681  15 470693  16 470779  17 470727  18 470721  19 470725  20 470671  21 470777  22 470679  23 470743  24 470737  25 470733  26 470765  27 470675  28 470673  29 470731  30 470763  31 470669  32 470699  33 470755  34 470691  35 470717  36 470703  37 470705  38 470701  39 470781  40 470663  41 470723  42 470767  43 470687  44 470713  45 470745  46 470739  47 470749  48 470757  49 470747  50 470769  51 470677  52 470771  53 470695  54 470697  55 470751  56 470761  57  58 topheadline  59  60 topheadline  61  62 topheadline  63  64 topheadline  65  66 topheadline  67  68 topheadline  69  70 topheadline  71  72 topheadline  73  74 topheadline  75  76 topheadline  77  78 topheadline  79  80 topheadline  81  82 topheadline  83  84 topheadline  85  86 topheadline  87  88 topheadline  89  90 topheadline  91  92 topheadline  93  94 topheadline  95  96 topheadline  97  98 topheadline  99  100 topheadline  101  102 topheadline  103  104 topheadline  105  106 topheadline  107  108 topheadline  109  110 topheadline  111  112 topheadline  113  114 topheadline  115  116 topheadline  117  118 topheadline  119  120 topheadline  121  122 topheadline  123  124 topheadline  125  126 topheadline  127  128 topheadline  129  130 topheadline  131  132 topheadline  133  134 topheadline  135  136 topheadline  137  138 topheadline  139  140 topheadline  141  142 topheadline  143  144 topheadline  145  146 topheadline  147  148 topheadline  149  150 topheadline  151  152 topheadline  153  154 topheadline  155  156 topheadline  157  158 topheadline  159  160 topheadline  161  162 topheadline  163  164 topheadline  165  166 topheadline  167  168 topheadline",homeless
kalamazoo,Patrick Lyoya's life mattered,2022-06-28T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,WWMT,"Early that morning, Lyoya was pulled over by Schurrnow a police officer in Grand Rapids, Michigans second largest cityallegedly for driving with an unregistered license plate. In a matter of minutes, the traffic stop turned into a foot chase a high-risk behavior increasingly discouraged in police reform circles, a struggle, and ultimately, an execution. While pinning Lyoya down and kneeling on his back, Schurr fatally shot Lyoya in the back of the head1. More than two months later, on June 9th, Kent County prosecutor Chris Becker announced murder charges against Schurr, in a rare2 but welcome turn of events. This is an important development in the fight for greater accountability for police use of deadly force. Over the past two months, local leaders and activists have kept up the pressure. Groups like the Grand Rapids Association of Pastors, which includes the support of nearly 70 local pastors from across denominations3 the Grand Rapids NAACP, the Black civil rights organization and other local leaders have been pressing authorities for transparency, accountability, and police reform in Grand Rapids. The police department there has been under investigation since 2019 by the Michigan Department of Civil Rights4. In his statement5, Becker argues that Schurrs use of deadly force cannot be characterized as self defense. The defense disagrees, saying Lyoyas murder was justified.6 The Lyoya family will now have to endure the lengthy and painful legal battle ahead. Perhaps Schurrs mission trip to Kenya7 is irrelevant to this latest example of Americas lethal problem of over-policing of Black communities. But we should acknowledge the cruel irony of a White Savior dressed in bluewho dressed like an African for his Christian mission weddingpinning down a Congolese refugee and fatally shooting him in the back of the head in the name of self-defense. Not only was Patrick Lyoya the victim of a violent reality in America where Black people are nearly three times as likely to be killed by police than white people8. He was also the victim of American austerity economics where policing stands in as a response to the defunding of social services9 and resettlement means acculturating to the impossible mathematics of pulling oneself up by their bootstraps without a safety net. Born in Uvira, Democratic Republic of Congo, 26-year-old Patrick Lyoya lived for over a decade in the Dzaleka refugee camp10 in Malawi the camp receives 300 new arrivals on average monthly, the majority from the DRC before being resettled with his family in Lansing, Michigans state capital, at the age of 18. According to The Washington Post11, Peter and Dorcas Lyoya worked odd jobs, and the family of eight shared a small apartment when they first moved to Michigan. Patrick Lyoya later moved to Grand Rapids where he moved between family and friends homes and where he most recently worked on the factory floor of an auto manufacturing plant. Not long before he was killed, Patrick had just moved into his own place, a milestone for the 26-year-old refugee. According to people close to him, Lyoya worked hard to take care of his family. He wanted to buy or build a home for his mother as part of his quest to achieve a comfortable middle-class American life. He was also a father of two and an active member of the Congolese community, where he was known to help new arrivals find their footing. Lyoya attended the Restoration Community Church of the United Methodist Church, where Pastor Banza Mukalay, also a refugee who resettled in the US, remembered him as a hard working young man who tried to make his future better.12 As much reporting has highlighted, Patricks life was complicated. According to Pastor Joshua Munonge Kibezi of Kalamazoo, MI,13 who lived in Malawi as a refugee with the Lyoyas, Patrick sometimes worked three jobs to support himself and his family. But existing media profiles have highlighted Patricks legal troubles dating back to 2015 without meaningfully reflecting on the ways in which resettlement policies intersect with anti-Black biases in America14 that place refugees like Patrick firmly into a violent cycle of over-policing and under-resourcing of Black immigrant lives. In recent years, Grand Rapids, MI, has become an important place of resettlement for refugees from the DRC. According to one source15, between March and October of 2019, 319 out of 490 refugees who resettled in Michigan were Congolese. And according to resettlement agency Bethany Christian Services, Grand Rapids was becoming the no. 1 place15 that Congolese refugees requested for resettlement as part of the process of secondary migration by which refugees seek to follow or reunite with family members through the resettlement process. As of 2019, Grand Rapids was home to about 8,000 refugees from the DRC and 11 Congolese churches. However, national resettlement numbers have significantly declined in recent years, particularly under the former Trump administration. This has meant that social services have also been slashed. Resettling in the US is exceptionally hard, as sociologist Heba Gowayed16 shows in her new book that details American resettlement policies and their implications for Syrian refugees. Resettlement in America relies heavily on the notion of self-sufficiency, treating newcomers as American low-income workers and denying them crucial services for integrating into American economic and social life. But the story doesnt end there. Where state and federal support services fall short, the growing Congolese refugee community in Michigan has been working hard to uplift and support its members. Pastor Kibezi who was close to Patrick runs a nonprofit called African Community Kalamazoo17. It gained official nonprofit status in 2019, formed to cater to the needs of all Africans, African refugees in Kalamazoo County, Michigan and by extension, the United States. Also, we promote the unity of Africans, and support the development of our host community. Among their services, African Community Kalamazoo works to ensure members of the community have adequate access to food, translation, and interpretation services for non-English speaking immigrants and refugees within the community. You can make a donation to their cause here18. According to their website, they are currently working to open a childcare center and provide help with finding affordable housing solutions for its community members. They are also looking for volunteers and donations of household goods, including food and diapers. Patrick Lyoya was involved in this work, too19work that the refugee community is doing to improve the lives of those whom American resettlement practices have failed to protect and uplift. Now, in light of the recent tragedy that has struck the refugee and Black community of Grand Rapids, Patricks father, Peter, cautions20 those who may be thinking about seeking asylum in the area I want to say for those people who are seeking asylum here, refuge, I dont want you to think this is a safe place. I thought it was a safe place, but it seems like we are in danger even when we come here. As Swahili speakers, the Lyoyas have relied on translators for interviews. It is unclear from media reports how strong Patricks English skills werebut New York Times reporting7 indicates that language was a barrier for him, possibly even in his encounter with Schurr on April 4th. Earlier this month, Michigan banned Swahili and Spanish dictionaries in its prisons, claiming that the books contents are a threat to the states penitentiaries.21 But this move begs the question how many among the growing Congolese population in Michigan are landing in the prison system? Statistics are not readily available. However, data compiled by the Vera Institute of Justice22 shows that while Black people make up 15 of Michigans population, they make up 53 of the states prison population and 37 of its jail population. According to The New York Times,7 Patrick Lyoya had spent some time in and out of jail. And according to some readers comments, Patricks legal troubles seem to justify his murder, which is a sad reflection of how too many Americans uncritically think about crimeviolent and nonviolentas a reflection of the individual more than as a reflection of Americas austerity economics and deepening social divides. Patrick Lyoyas case has drawn national attention. The Reverend Al Sharpton eulogized Patrick at his funeral on April 22nd, and Patricks parents hired well-known civil rights attorney Ben Crump. Davionne Smith, a Black Lives Matter activist and cousin to Breonna Taylor a Grand Rapids native, has helped organize marches calling for justice for Patrick and his family.

kalamazoo,8 ways the coronavirus is more dangerous for veterans,2020-05-22T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,WWMT,"May 22, 2020 The Business Insider Delivered by Newstex  The coronavirus pandemic has hit different communities with different levels of severity.Among the hardest hit are veterans, who are particularly susceptible to both health and economic threats posed by the coronavirus.Visit Business Insiders homepage for more stories1. As the nation takes a day to memorialize its military dead, those who are living are facing a deadly risk that has nothing to do with war or conflict the coronavirus.Different groups face different degrees of danger from the pandemic, from the elderly who are experiencing deadly outbreaks in nursing homes2 to communities of color with higher infection and death rates3. Veterans are among the most hard-hit4, with heightened health and economic threats from the pandemic. These veterans face homelessness, lack of health care, delays in receiving financial support and even death.I have spent the past four years studying veterans with substance use and mental health disorders who are in the criminal justice system5. This work revealed gaps in health care and financial support for veterans, even though they have the best publicly funded6 benefits7 in the country.Here are eight ways the pandemic threatens veterans 1. Age and other vulnerabilities Vietnam War veterans at the Memorial Day observance at Arlington National Cemetery, May 30, 2016.

kalamazoo,8 ways the coronavirus is more dangerous for veterans,2020-05-22T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,WWMT,"The largest group served in the Vietnam era, where 2.8 million veterans were exposed to Agent Orange9, a chemical defoliant linked to cancer.Younger veterans deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan were exposed to dust storms, oil fires and burn pits with numerous toxins10, and perhaps as a consequence have high rates of asthma and other respiratory illnesses11.Age and respiratory illnesses are both risk factors for COVID-19 mortality. As of May 2212, there have been 12,979 people under Veterans Administration care with COVID-19, of whom 1,100 have died. 2. Dangerous residential facilities Veterans needing end-of-life care, those with cognitive disabilities or those needing substance use treatment often live in crowded VA or state-funded residential facilities.State-funded soldiers homes are notoriously starved for money and staff. The horrific situation13 at the soldiers home in Holyoke, Massachusetts, where more than 79 veteran residents have died from a COVID-19 outbreak14, illustrates the risk facing the veterans in residential homes. 3. Benefits unfairly denied A transition clerk assists a Reservist with his Department of Defense Form 214 as part of the demobilizing process, at Fort Bliss, March 6, 2015. US ArmyAdam Holguin When a person transitions from active military service to become a veteran, they receive a Certificate of Discharge or Release15. This certificate provides information about the circumstances of the discharge or release. It includes characterizations such as honorable, other than honorable, bad conduct or dishonorable. These are crucial distinctions, because that status determines whether the Veterans Administration will give them benefits16.Research shows that some veterans with discharges that limit their benefits have PTSD symptoms, military sexual trauma or other behaviors related to military stress. Veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan have disproportionately more17 of these negative discharges than veterans from other eras, for reasons still unclear18.The Veterans Administration frequently and perhaps unlawfully19 denies benefits to veterans with other than honorable discharges.Many veterans have requested upgrades to their discharge status. There is a significant backlog of these upgrade requests20, and the pandemic will add to it, further delaying access to health care and other benefits. 4. Diminished access to healthcare Dental surgery, routine visits and elective surgeries at Veterans Administration medical centers have been postponed since mid-March. VA hospitals are understaffed21 - just before the pandemic, the VA reported 43,000 staff vacancies out of more than 400,000 health care staff positions. Access to health care will be even more difficult when those medical centers finally reopen because they may have far fewer workers than they need.As of May 4, 2020, 2,250 VA health care workers22 have tested positive for COVID-19, and thousands of health care workers are under quarantine. The VA is asking doctors and nurses23 to come out of retirement to help already understaffed hospitals. 5. Mental health may get worse Veterans and military personnel at a military job fair in Sandy, Utah, March 26, 2019. Reuters An average of 20 veterans die by suicide every day. A national task force24 is currently addressing this scourge.But many outpatient mental health programs are on hold or being held virtually25. Some residential mental health facilities have closed26.Under these conditions, the suicide rate for veterans may grow. Suicide hotline calls by veterans were up by 12 on March 22, just a few weeks into the crisis27. 6. Complications for homeless veterans and those in the justice system An estimated 45,000 veterans28 are homeless on any given night, and 181,500 veterans29 are in prison or jail. Thousands more are under court-supervised substance use and mental health treatment in veterans treatment courts30. More than half31 of veterans involved with the justice system have either mental health problems or substance use disorders.As residential facilities close to new participants, many veterans eligible to leave prison or jail have nowhere to go. They may stay incarcerated or become homeless.Courts have moved online32 or ceased formal operations altogether, meaning no veteran charged with a crime can be referred to a treatment court. It is unclear whether those who were already participating in a treatment program will face delays graduating from court-supervised treatments.Further, some veterans treatment courts still require participants to take drug tests33. With COVID-19 circulating, those participants must put their health at risk to travel to licensed testing facilities. 7. Disability benefits delayed US Army veteran Kenneth Fuller, 92, shakes hands with Filipino World War II veteran Jose Kilatan, 100, during Veterans Day ceremonies at the American cemetery in Taguig city, Manila, November 11, 2015. REUTERSEzra Acayan In the pandemics epicenter in New York, tens of thousands of veterans34 should have access to VA benefits because of their low income - but dont, so far.The pandemic has exacerbated existing delays in finding veterans in need, filing their paperwork and waiting for decisions. Ryan Foley, an attorney in New Yorks Legal Assistance Group, a nonprofit legal services organization, noted in a personal communication that these benefits are worth tens of millions of dollars to veterans and their families in the midst of a health and economic disaster.All 56 regional Veterans Administration offices are closed35 to encourage social distancing. Compensation and disability evaluations, which determine how much money veterans can get, are usually done in person. Now, they must be done electronically, via telehealth services in which the veteran communicates with a health care provider via computer.But getting telehealth up and running is taking time, adding to the longstanding VA backlog36. Currently, more than 100,000 veterans37 wait more than 125 days for a decision. That is what the VA defines as a backlog - anything less than 125 days is not considered a delay on benefit claims. 8. Economic catastrophe There are 1.2 million veteran employees in the five industries most severely affected38 by the economic fallout of the coronavirus.A disproportionately high number of post-911 veterans live in some of the hardest-hit communities that depend on these industries. Veterans returning from overseas will face a dire economic landscape, with far fewer opportunities to integrate into civilian life with financial security.In addition, severely disabled veterans living off of VA benefits were initially required to file a tax return to get stimulus checks39. This initial filing requirement delayed benefits for severely disabled veterans by at least a month. The IRS finally changed the requirements40 after public outcry, given that many older and severely disabled veterans do not have access to computers or the technological skills to file electronically.There are many social groups to pay attention to, all with their own problems to face during the pandemic. With veterans, many of the problems they face now existed long before the coronavirus arrived on U.S. shores.But with the challenges posed by the situation today, veterans who were already lacking adequate benefits and resources are now in deeper trouble, and it will be harder to answer their needs.Editors note This is an updated version of a story41 that originally ran on April 16, 2020.Deep knowledge, daily.
