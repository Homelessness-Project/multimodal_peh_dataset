We care about being in the field and following the needs of the real economy on site, and we continue to achieve balanced growth with the solutions we have developed.”</p><p>“We have prioritized new products that support the Turkish Lira”</p><p>Halkbank continues to offer profitable products to depositors. It has now launched a “Dollar to TRY Conversion Deposit Account” for customers who want to sell their foreign currency and invest their savings in Turkish Lira. Arslan said, “With rising expectations for the appreciation of Turkish lira-denominated assets, new products needed to be created to support the Turkish Lira. We believe that the new product we have prepared to meet this need will incentivize our customers, who have previously turned to foreign currencies, to adopt profitable investments</p><p>such as the Turkish lira.”</p><p>“We develop innovative products with the market conditions in mind”</p><p>Arslan stated that they are prioritizing the development of products in line with Halkbank’s innovative vision as they continue their infrastructure investments to carry their traditional banking services further.

We would love to see such positive developments in every aspect of life. Our recently introduced Employment-Oriented Working Capital Loan also aims to provide a healthy and sustainable contribution to current employment for the steady growth and development of our economy.

(President and CEO: Shinsuke Baba; Head Office: Tokyo) (“Aozora” or “the Bank”) today published the results of a brief survey which took a look at its customers’ attitudes and approaches regarding saving money following the July 2019 launch of BANK™, its new money service for retail customers. With Japan gradually making the transition into a cashless society, the survey examined the continued use of piggy banks and similar approaches as a tool for saving money, in addition to more technology-oriented alternatives.</p><p>Survey Response Highlights:</p><p>1. Four out of ten respondents still use a piggy bank/savings box for savings.</p><p>Four out of ten respondents indicated that they still used a piggy bank or savings box as way to store their savings, even well into adulthood.</p><p>2. Reasons for not using a piggy bank to store savings.</p><p>For six out of ten respondents who indicated they no longer used a piggy bank, three main reasons were cited for why they stopped: 1. “inability to actually save money”, 2. “difficulty in keeping track of savings amount”, and 3. “unable to save a significant amount of money.”</p><p>3. Younger generation is more likely to use a piggy bank because it makes saving money “enjoyable”.</p><p>When asked why they use piggy banks, a higher proportion of respondents in the younger age groups (20’s and 30’s) indicated that it was because they found the practice enjoyable, suggesting that younger people take satisfaction in gradually saving up funds.</p><p>4. Only one in three respondents feel confident in being able to meet their savings goals. Preference for cashless payment methods correlated with higher confidence.</p><p>Overall, only one in three respondents reported that they were able to save as much money as planned. When analyzed by preferred payment method, the result was only 27% for the cash payers but 40% for respondents who prefer cashless payment methods. This result may suggest that those who prefer cashless payments are more focused about building their savings.</p><p>5. Over 30% of respondents in their 60’s, 50% of respondents in their 20’s and 30’s showed an interest in using smartphones to manage savings.</p><p>Of the respondents in their 60’s, 31% reported that they would like to manage their savings via smartphone, suggesting an interest in technology-based money management within the senior age group. Not surprisingly, a majority of respondents in their 20’s and 30’s expressed an interest in using technology, confirming the assumption that the younger generation have stronger preference for technology-based solutions.</p><p>6. Interest in using smartphones to save money correlated with higher savings targets.</p><p>Of particular note was that the survey found that respondents who showed an interest in using a “digital piggy bank app” to help them save money also tended to set higher savings targets.</p><p><url normalizedValue=""https://www.aozorabank.co.jp/english/about/newsrelease/2019/pdf/19112801_n.pdf"">https://www.aozorabank.co.jp/english/about/newsrelease/2019/pdf/19112801_n.pdf</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">Aozora Bank Ltd (TYO) - Aozora Investment Subsidiary Appointed to Underwrite Convertible Bonds Issued by KAKEHASHI, Inc. – 22/11/2019</emphasis></p><p>Aozora Bank, Ltd.

A further 4% of children now ask their parents to pay their cash into specific pocket money apps.</p><p>This increase in using bank accounts for pocket money has been spurred on by older children. 29% of boys and 32% of girls aged between 12 and 15, receive some of their pocket money straight into an account, compared to 18% of boys and 12% of girls aged 8 to 11.</p><p>Boys are more likely to go online to manage their accounts, with nearly a third (29%) of 12 to 15 year olds, choosing this option.

They included the exceptional 267 million euro impact of businesses’ transformation costs and acquisitions’ restructuring costs3 (222 million euros in the third quarter 2017).</p><p>The operating expenses of the operating divisions rose by 2.1% compared to the third quarter 2017 (+1.4% at constant scope and exchange rates): they were up by 0.2% for Domestic Markets1 with a rise in the specialised businesses related to business development but down in the domestic networks (France, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg), up by 6.1% for International Financial Services as a result of business growth, but down by 0.7% for CIB due to cost saving measures.</p><p>The gross operating income of the Group thus totalled 3,075 million euros, down by 5.7%. It was down by 3.1% for the operating divisions (-0.3% at constant scope and exchange rates).</p><p>The cost of risk, at 686 million euros (668 million euros in the third quarter 2017), was up by 2.7% compared to the third quarter 2017. At 34 basis points of outstanding customer loans, it was still at a low level which reflects in particular the good control of risk at loan origination, the low interest rate environment and the continued improvement of the portfolio in Italy.</p><p>The Group’s operating income, at 2,389 million euros (2,593 million euros in the third quarter 2017), was thus down by 7.9%.

It was down by 11.5% for the operating divisions (-2.9% at constant scope and exchange rates).</p><p>Corporate income taxes were down as a result of the low tax rate on the long term capital gain from the sale of 30.3% of First Hawaiian Bank and the decrease in the corporate tax rate in Belgium and the United States. Net income attributable to equity holders was thus 2,124 million euros, up by 4.0% compared to the third quarter 2017 (2,043 million euros).

They included the exceptional 753 million euro impact of businesses’ transformation costs and acquisitions’ restructuring costs6 (501 million euros in the first nine months of 2017).

This low level reflects in particular the good control of risk at loan origination, the low interest rate environment and the continued improvement in Italy.</p><p>The Group’s operating income, at 7,583 million euros (8,384 million euros in the first nine months of 2017), was thus down by 9.6%. It was down by 5.0% for the operating divisions (-5.1% at constant scope and exchange rates).</p><p>Non-operating items totalled 942 million euros (804 million euros in the first nine months of 2017).

It was down by 7.6% for the operating divisions (-5.2% at constant scope and exchange rates).</p><p>The average tax rate was 25.5%, benefitting from a positive 2 point effect due to the decrease of the corporate income tax rate in Belgium and in the US and from the low tax rate on the long term capital gain from the sale of a 30.3% stake in First Hawaiian Bank.</p><p>Net income attributable to equity holders was 6,084 million euros, down by 3.9% compared to the first nine months of 2017 but by only 2.8% excluding exceptional items2.</p><p>The return on equity excluding exceptional items was thus 9.5%.

Once again, all the operating segments – corporate and real estate customers, savings banks and the public sector, financial institutions and retail customers – made a positive contribution.</p><p>“The results reflect the path we have taken in the past few years, specifically placing the customer at the heart of our activities,” commented BayernLB’s CEO, Johannes-Jörg Riegler. “Our universal bank approach has proved its worth once again. We have built on this strong foundation, developing a grounded ethos which will enable us to rise to the challenges of the future and achieve success for both ourselves and our customers. We will continue in this vein, acting as a steadfast partner to German business and working to establish BayernLB as one of the strongest regional banks in Europe in the medium term,” Riegler continued.</p><p>Consolidated profit (after taxes) climbed to EUR 342 million (H1 2017: EUR 330 million). BayernLB’s fully loaded capital ratio (CET1 ratio) is 14.4 percent and remains very solid. Return on equity (RoE) improved to 10.0 percent in the first six months of 2018 (H1 2017: 9.6 percent). At 59.5 percent, the cost/income ratio (CIR) was on par with the year-before period and remained within the target range (H1 2017: 59.5 percent).</p><p>Despite the challenging environment, BayernLB’s net interest income rose by a further 4.0 percent to EUR 879 million (H1 2017: EUR 845 million) thanks to a sharp increase at DKB.</p><p>Net commission income, by comparison, was down slightly at EUR 132 million (H1 2017: EUR 141 million). In addition, the Bank benefited from its conservative risk policy and posted positive net risk provisions in the credit business of EUR 103 million (H1 2017: EUR 90 million). Good portfolio quality, the stable economic environment in the Bank’s core markets and recoveries on written down receivables were contributory factors.</p><p>Gains or losses on fair value measurement totalled EUR 35 million, considerably less than the previous-year figure of EUR 143 million. This was due to lower income from customer-driven business with capital market products and slimmer measurement gains. In addition, measurement gains overstated the year-before period figure.</p><p>Administrative expenses grew slightly by 5.4 percent to EUR 644 million (H1 2017: EUR 612 million). This was largely due to higher expenses for meeting regulatory requirements, strategic investments in sales and Group-wide initiatives to digitalise the Bank’s business and operating model.</p><p>Expenses for the bank levy and deposit guarantee scheme comprised a total charge of EUR 90 million (H1 2017: EUR 84 million). This included EUR 52 million for the bank levy (H1 2017: EUR 52 million) and a EUR 38 million contribution to the Savings Banks Finance Group's deposit guarantee scheme (H1 2017: EUR 31 million).</p><p>Total assets and risk-weighted assets (RWAs) edged up in response to BayernLB’s expansion of its lending and money market business with customers. As at 30 June, BayernLB’s total assets amounted to EUR 226.3 billion, 5.5 percent higher than at the end of 2017. RWAs rose slightly by 4.8 percent to EUR 64.4 billion.</p><p>Further improvement in the viability rating</p><p>Rating agency Fitch raised BayernLB’s viability rating in the second quarter to bbb+, to reflect the Bank’s positive performance, its significantly improved capital base and good asset quality. The rating for subordinated bonds (Tier 2) followed suit, climbing one notch to BBB. The long-term issuer rating of A- was confirmed with a stable outlook.</p><p>Earnings in the operating business segments</p><p>Corporates &amp; Mittelstand</p><p>The Corporates &amp; Mittelstand segment reported profit before taxes of EUR 181 million (H1 2017: EUR 212 million). Impacted by tough competition and the resulting pressure on margins, operating earnings from net interest and net commission income declined to EUR 184 million (H1 2017: EUR 201 million). The income from capital market products, by contrast, was mostly stable. A continuously good portfolio quality, further releases of risk provisions and high recoveries on written down receivables resulted in net positive risk provisions of EUR 125 million (H1 2017: EUR 133 million). BayernLB further expanded its lending business with corporate customers to EUR 54 billion, an increase of EUR 1 billion compared to the year-before period (H1 2017: EUR 53 billion).</p><p>Real Estate &amp; Savings Banks/Association</p><p>In the Real Estate &amp; Savings Banks/Association segment, profit before taxes was down on the year-before period at EUR 73 million (H1 2017: EUR 100 mil-lion). A large portion of the segment’s earnings once more came from the real estate business, which posted profit before taxes of EUR 57 million (H1 2017: EUR 79 million). Persistently high customer demand drove up the volume of new business acquired compared to the year-before period, which in turn also pushed up operating earnings by EUR 4 million to EUR 100 million. At EUR -10 million, profit before taxes in business with savings banks (Savings Banks &amp; Association division) was slightly below that of the year-before period (EUR -9 million). BayernLabo, BayernLB’s development institute for residential construction, posted profit before taxes of EUR 19 million (H1 2017: EUR 23 million). Earnings at Real I.S., BayernLB’s real estate management company, were on par with the previous-year period at EUR 6 million.</p><p>Financial Markets</p><p>The Bank’s capital market activities, customer business with financial institutions and the asset management subsidiary BayernInvest are bundled under the Financial Markets segment. The segment's profit before taxes amounted to EUR 21 million (H1 2017: EUR 106 million), whereby the high figure for the previous-year period was boosted significantly by high one-off income and measurement gains. Income from the customer business was stable compared with the previous year in spite of stiff competition and subdued demand. As usual, BayernLB reported earnings from Financial Markets products on behalf of the other customer-serving business segments under those segments. The release of fair value adjustments of derivatives transactions resulted once again in a small measurement gain totalling EUR 8 million in the reporting period (H1 2017: EUR 58 million). BayernInvest posted profit before taxes of EUR 3 million (H1 2017: EUR 5 million).</p><p>DKB</p><p>The DKB segment posted profit before taxes of EUR 204 million, a marked increase once again on the previous year (H1 2017: EUR 116 million). Most of this amount (EUR 190 million; H1 2017: EUR 113 million) related to the DKB sub-group, while EUR 12 million (H1 2017: EUR 2 million) related to Bayern Card-Services (BCS). Net interest income was significantly higher than the year-before period again at EUR 511 million (H1 2017: EUR 429 million) despite the persistently difficult interest-rate environment. The interest income came partly from an improved refinancing structure (e.g. a more cost-effective replacement of expiring transactions). The number of retail customers that DKB serves online broke through the 3.8 million mark.</p><p><url normalizedValue=""https://www.bayernlb.com/internet/en/blb/resp/bayernlb_2/news_215683.jsp"">https://www.bayernlb.com/internet/en/blb/resp/bayernlb_2/news_215683.jsp</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">Commerzbank</emphasis></p><p>Commerzbank is a leading international commercial bank.

In the Private and Small Business Customers segment, it gained around 117,000 net new customers in Germany in the third quarter. With a good 900,000 net new customers since October 2016, it is on track to achieve its target of one million net new customers by the end of 2018. The Corporate Clients segment is still ahead of its 2018 targets for new customers and volume of lending.</p><p>Group revenues after adjustment for non-recurring items rose in the first nine months to €6,690 million (9M 2017: €6,338 million). In the third quarter the Bank increased its underlying revenues by nearly 9% year-on-year to €2,175 million (Q3 2017: €2,003 million). The Bank made further progress with the implementation of its strategy. In the third quarter, the migration of small business customers from the Corporate Clients segment to the Private and Small Business Customers segment was completed and the new relationship model for corporate clients established, among other things. Group revenues stood at €6,727 million in the first nine months (9M 2017: €6,955 million). Last year’s figure had been bolstered by non-recurring items amounting to €617 million in the first nine months. In 2018, exceptional revenues in the first nine months stood at just €37 million. Overall, higher revenues from customer business helped to largely offset the difference year-on-year. In the third quarter, revenues amounted to €2,193 million (Q3 2017: €2,505 million). Operating expenses totalled €5,412 million in the first nine months (9M 2017: €5,297 million). The year-onyear increase was mainly due to investments in strategy implementation and further growth.</p><p>Operating expenses for the third quarter stood at €1,728 million (Q3 2017: €1,714 million). Costs were therefore in line with expectations for 2018, as was the risk result. It stood at minus €295 million in the first nine months and minus €134 million in the third quarter. This reflects the Bank’s portfolio quality and the benign credit environment. The non-performing loan (NPL) ratio remained very low, at 0.9%.</p><p>The operating profit for the first nine months came to €1,020 million (9M 2017: €1,128 million). It benefited from higher underlying revenues, a lower risk result and a positive contribution from the Asset and Capital Recovery segment. In the third quarter, the operating profit came in at €331 million (Q3 2017: €623 million). The year-on-year decline is attributable mainly to exceptional revenues of €502 million in the third quarter of 2017, including from real estate sales.</p><p>After deduction of taxes of €187 million and minority interests of €81 million, Commerzbank posted a net result of €751 million for the first nine months of 2018 (9M 2017: €53 million; impacted by restructuring expenses of around €800 million). The net result for the third quarter came in at €218 million (Q3 2017: €467 million).</p><p>“We increased our underlying revenues and steadily gain new customers. This shows that we have the right strategy: We grow in a highly competitive market. Our improved setup has also been confirmed by the European stress test. However, the environment remains challenging and although we have made a lot of progress, we still have some work to do”, said Martin Zielke, Chairman of the Board of Managing Directors of Commerzbank.” Chief Financial Officer Stephan Engels added: “We have significantly improved the quality of our earnings compared to last year. Our capital ratio and our leverage ratio are stable on a good level. Our outlook for the full year remains unchanged.”</p><p>The Common Equity Tier 1 ratio (CET 1) stood at 13.2% at the end of September, versus 13.0% at the end of June 2018. This includes earnings for the first nine months, factoring in a dividend accrual of 15 cents per share. Risk-weighted assets (RWA) amounted to €178 billion at the end of September, versus €176 billion at the end of June 2018. This rise, resulting partly from increased lending in the core segments, was more than offset by capital build-up. The leverage ratio stood at 4.5%. Total assets came to €493 billion (end of June 2018: €488 billion). The Bank’s achievements in risk reduction and improved balance sheet quality contributed to a significantly improved result in this year’s European Banking Authority stress test.</p><p>Development of the segments</p><p>The Private and Small Business Customers segment benefited from the continued growth in customers and Assets under Control, and increased its revenues after adjustment for non-recurring items by 7.8% yearon-year in the first nine months to €3,663 million. Underlying revenues were also up year-on-year for the third quarter, at €1,228 million (Q3 2017: €1,125 million). Assets under Control in Germany went up in all product categories, to stand at €392 billion at the end of the third quarter. The volume of mortgage lending grew by 10% year-on-year, reaching around €74 billion in September.</p><p>The segment’s operating expenses stood at €2,893 million (9M 2017: €2,794 million). The year-on-year increase was due to higher regulatory costs and investments in growth. The risk result came to minus €184 million. The operating profit stood at €564 million for the first nine months (9M 2017: €712 million, including non-recurring items of €238 million). Operating profit for the third quarter stood at €188 million (Q3 2017: €380 million). In the previous year, non-recurring effects from the sale of the Concardis holdings and termination of the consumer finance joint venture with BNP Paribas had contributed to the segment’s profit.</p><p>In the Corporate Clients segment, continued high margin pressure and competition impacted earnings. The Financial Institutions division returned to a stable profit contribution this year, following its realignment. Revenues from business with SMEs, large corporates and international companies were affected – despite some successful growth initiatives – by margin pressure, low interest rates and weak demand for hedging products. The result of the Equity Markets &amp; Commodities division was driven by lower demand for structured products.</p><p>The Corporate Clients segment generated revenues of €2,836 million in the first nine months (9M 2017: €3,015 million), including €918 million in the third quarter (Q3 2017: €967 million). Operating expenses amounted to €2,189 million (9M 2017: €2,148 million). The risk result, which had benefited from releases in the first half of the year, normalised and stood at minus €124 million after nine months (Q3: minus €62 million). The operating profit came to €523 million for the first nine months (9M 2017: €743m) and to €169 million for the third quarter (Q3 2017: €237 million).</p><p>The Asset &amp; Capital Recovery (ACR) segment recorded an operating profit of €90 million for the first nine months (9M 2017: minus €210 million, Q3 2018: €14 million). This result reflects both the reduced size of the segment's run-down portfolio and the revaluation of the Ship Finance portfolio following the introduction of IFRS 9. Revenues amounted to €135 million (9M 2017: €146 million). The revenue figure for the third quarter was €28 million. Operating expenses were further reduced, coming in at €60 million for the first nine months (9M 2017: €79 million). The risk result came out at €15 million. The Bank’s Ship Finance portfolio was run down further and stood at a volume of €1.1 billion at the end of the third quarter (Q3 2017: €4.2 billion).</p><p>Outlook</p><p>The outlook remains unchanged. In 2018, the Bank will focus on further growth and the implementation of its Commerzbank 4.0 strategy. Higher underlying revenues are expected at Group level with the Private and Small Business Customers segment exceeding and the Corporate Clients segment being below the 2017 figures. Driven by investments and compulsory contributions, costs are expected to be at around €7.1 billion. The risk result under IFRS 9 should be below €500 million, provided the global trade conflicts do not escalate significantly and there are no unforeseeable larger credit events. The Bank is aiming to resume dividend payments of 20 cents per share for financial year 2018.</p><p><url normalizedValue=""https://www.commerzbank.de/media/aktionaere/service/archive/konzern/2018_2/q3_2018/Commerzbank_Q3_PR.pdf"">https://www.commerzbank.de/media/aktionaere/service/archive/konzern/2018_2/q3_2018/Commerzbank_Q3_PR.pdf</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">Aozora Bank Ltd.</emphasis></p><p>Aozora Bank, Ltd. is a Japan-based bank that operates banking, financial products trading, trust, investment operation and investment advisory businesses.

Taking into account these conditions, the management team at Aozora maintained our focus on disciplined risk management as well as implementing our business strategy in line with our new Mid-term Plan. For the first nine months, our net earnings were 29.7 billion yen, representing progress of 69% towards our full-year forecast.

Statutory return on tangible equity improved by 3.9 percentage points to 12.1 per cent.</p><p>Underlying profit was £4,234 million, 7 per cent higher than in the first half of 2017 with higher net income and lower total costs partly offset by the expected higher impairment charge. The underlying return on tangible equity increased to 16.3 per cent.</p><p>The balance sheet remains strong with the Group’s CET1 capital ratio increasing by 121 basis points, on a pro forma basis, to 15.1 per cent pre dividend and to 14.5 per cent post dividend (31 December 2017: 13.9 per cent pro forma post dividend and share buy back). The capital build includes the impact of the interim Insurance dividend paid in July 2018 and the sale of the Irish mortgage portfolio (25 basis points) which will complete later in the third quarter.</p><p>Net income</p><p>Net income at £8,971 million was 2 per cent higher than in the first half of 2017 with growth in net interest income partly offset by lower other operating income.</p><p>Net interest income at £6,344 million increased by 7 per cent reflecting an improved net interest margin and increased average interest-earning banking assets which were 1 per cent higher at £436 billion. The net interest margin increased by 11 basis points to 2.93 per cent with lower deposit and wholesale funding costs more than offsetting continued pressure on asset margins. The margin also benefitted from changing product mix and growth in consumer finance, including the acquisition of MBNA.</p><p>The Group manages the risk to its earnings and capital from movements in interest rates centrally by hedging the net liabilities which are stable or less sensitive to movements in rates. As at 30 June 2018 the Group was fully hedged with a nominal balance of £171 billion (31 December 2017: £165 billion) and an average duration of around 4.1 years (31 December 2017: c.3 years). The Group generated £1.3 billion of income from the structural hedge balances in the period (half-year to 30 June 2017: £1.2 billion) with a fixed earnings rate of approximately 0.9 per cent over LIBOR.</p><p>Given the strong performance, the Group now expects net interest margin for 2018 to be in line with the first half of 2018 and for the margin to remain resilient over the plan period.</p><p>Other income at £3,124 million reflected a good second quarter and excluding the £146 million gain on the sale of Vocalink recognised in the first half of 2017, was slightly down year on year.</p><p>The good performance in the second quarter of £1.7 billion was primarily driven by Insurance with higher new business volumes and increased contributions in workplace pensions, increased income from bulk annuities, and lower weather related insurance claims. Commercial Banking was also up in the quarter driven by increased markets activity whilst Retail income was stable. Other income in the half includes a gain of £191 million on the sale of £11 billion of gilts and other liquid assets, compared with a £146 million gain from the £5 billion sale of such assets in the first half of 2017.</p><p>The Group now expects 2018 other income to be broadly in line with 2017 excluding Vocalink.</p><p>Total costs</p><p>Operating costs at £4,024 million were flat compared to the first half of 2017, despite increased investment and inclusion of the MBNA cost base.</p><p>The Group continues to focus on reducing its underlying cost base, and before investment and the inclusion of MBNA operating costs reduced by 7 per cent, largely driven by increased efficiency from digitalisation, process improvement and better procurement. This cost discipline creates capacity for increased investment with investment expensed and depreciation up 14 per cent in the period.</p><p>Remediation charges were 52 per cent lower at £257 million and included additional charges of £197 million in the second quarter. The additional provision covers a number of small items and largely relates to incremental costs of existing programmes.</p><p>The Group’s market leading cost:income ratio continues to provide competitive advantage and improved further to 47.7 per cent with positive jaws of 8 per cent. The Group’s cost:income ratio excluding remediation also improved to 44.9 per cent.</p><p>The Group continues to target a cost:income ratio (including remediation) in the low 40’s exiting 2020, with reductions every year, and for operating costs to be lower than £8 billion in 2020.</p><p>Impairment</p><p>Asset quality across the portfolio remains strong and stable with no deterioration in credit risk indicators. The Group’s loan portfolios continue to be well positioned, reflecting our continued prudent through the cycle approach to credit risk, and benefiting from continued low interest rates and a resilient UK economy.</p><p>The gross asset quality ratio at 27 basis points remains in line with full year 2017 and 2016, despite the inclusion of MBNA. On a net basis the asset quality ratio increased to 20 basis points reflecting expected lower releases and writebacks. The impairment charge increased to £456 million in the first half of 2018, again reflecting lower releases and write-backs.</p><p>Stage 3 loans at £8.7 billion as a proportion of total loans and advances to customers have reduced to 1.8 per cent (1 January 2018: 1.9 per cent), while at the same time coverage of Stage 3 drawn balances has increased to 25.2 per cent (1 January 2018: 24.0 per cent).</p><p>Overall credit performance in the UK mortgage book remains stable. The average loan to value reduced again to 43.5 per cent (31 December 2017: 43.6 per cent) while the proportion of lending with an LTV of greater than 90 per cent remained low at 2.5 per cent (31 December 2017: 2.5 per cent). No deterioration is being seen in the portfolio with new to arrears as a proportion of total lending continuing to fall.</p><p>The unsecured portfolios also continue to perform strongly with new to arrears rates remaining stable and the MBNA portfolio performing in line with the Group’s expectations. The UK motor finance book continues to perform well given resilient car prices and is benefiting from our conservative approach to residual values and prudent provisioning, including a £200 million residual value and specific event provision.</p><p>The Commercial Banking portfolio continues to benefit from effective risk management, a resilient economic environment and continued low interest rates with the increased impairment charge driven by lower releases and write-backs.</p><p>The Group now expects the asset quality ratio to be less than 25 basis points in 2018 and continues to expect less than 30 basis points through the plan period. The Group continues to expect asset quality to remain strong but with further reductions in releases and write-backs.</p><p>Statutory profit</p><p>Statutory profit before tax of £3,117 million (2017: £2,544 million) increased 23 per cent, driven by the increased underlying profit and lower PPI charge. Statutory profit after tax increased by 38 per cent to £2,267 million (2017: £1,639 million).</p><p>Restructuring costs of £377 million included £155 million for severance costs relating to the Group’s strategic investment plans as well as the costs of the integration of MBNA and Zurich’s UK workplace pensions and savings business, implementing regulatory reform and ring-fencing and the rationalisation of the non-branch property portfolio.</p><p>Market volatility and asset sales of £34 million included positive banking and insurance volatility, partly offset by the £105 million loss on sale of the Irish mortgage portfolio and an adjustment to past service pension liability.</p><p>The PPI charge of £550 million included an additional £460 million in the second quarter and now covers claims volumes of approximately 13,000 per week until the deadline in August 2019, compared to the 11,000 run rate previously assumed. The outstanding balance sheet provision at 30 June 2018 was £2 billion.</p><p>Tax expense</p><p>The tax expense was £850 million (2017: £905 million) representing an effective tax rate of 27 per cent (2017: 36 per cent). The high effective tax rate in the first half of 2017 of 36 per cent largely reflected the restrictions on deductibility of conduct provisions, which included remediation.</p><p>The Group continues to expect the effective tax rate to reduce to around 25 per cent in 2020.</p><p>Return on tangible equity</p><p>The return on tangible equity was 12.1 per cent up from 8.2 per cent in the first half of 2017, reflecting the increase in statutory profit after tax. The underlying return on tangible equity increased to 16.3 per cent (half-year to 30 June 2017: 14.5 per cent) primarily reflecting increased underlying profit.</p><p>Balance sheet</p><p>Group loans and advances to customers fell slightly to £442 billion with growth in targeted segments more than offset by the £4 billion sale of the Irish residential mortgage portfolio. Over the last six months, SME and Motor Finance have continued to grow whilst the open mortgage book of £267 billion is in line with the start of the year. The Group continues to expect the year end position for open mortgages to be slightly higher than the end of 2017.</p><p>Loans and advances to customers were adjusted on adoption of IFRS 9, resulting in an £11.5 billion reduction to £444 billion on 1 January 2018. This was primarily due to the reclassification of certain assets transferred from the banking business to the insurance business in recent years which have been designated at fair value, in common with other assets within the Insurance business, as well as assets which have failed the solely payments of principal and interest test.</p><p>The loan to deposit ratio was down slightly at 106 per cent. Wholesale funding increased by 21 per cent to £122 billion compared with £101 billion at 31 December 2017 reflecting increased term issuance following the end of the Bank of England’s Term Funding Scheme and an increase to our liquidity position during the period of the ring-fencing transfers through additional short term money market funding.</p><p>The Group’s liquidity surplus exceeds the regulatory minimum and internal risk appetite with a Liquidity Coverage Ratio of 129 per cent based on the EU Delegated Act at 30 June 2018 (31 December 2017: 127 per cent).</p><p>Capital</p><p>The Group’s CET1 ratio has strengthened to 15.1 per cent on a pro forma basis, pre dividend, an increase of 121 basis points in the first half of the year. The increase includes 111 basis points generated from underlying banking profits, 8 basis points relating to the interim dividend received from the Insurance business, 25 basis points in relation to the sale of the Irish mortgage portfolio, and 5 basis points from market and other movements. These impacts were partially offset by 28 basis points for PPI charges. Post dividend accrual, the Group’s pro forma CET1 ratio was 14.5 per cent (14.1 per cent excluding the impact of the interim Insurance dividend and the sale of the Irish mortgage portfolio)</p><p>The Group remains highly capital generative and given the strong first half, the Group now expects the CET1 build to be c.200 basis points pre dividend in 2018. The Group continues to expect to deliver 170 to 200 basis points every year, pre dividend, on an ongoing basis.</p><p>In July 2018, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) reduced the Group’s Pillar 2A CET1 requirement to 2.6 per cent from 3.0 per cent. It will increase to 2.7 per cent from 1 January 2019 following entry into force of the UK’s ring-fencing regime. The Board’s view of the level of CET1 capital required remains at c.13 per cent, plus a management buffer of around 1 per cent.</p><p>Total capital ratio remains strong at 21.6 per cent and the Group remains well positioned to meet its MREL from 2020 with a pro forma transitional MREL ratio at 30 June 2018 of 29.7 per cent (31 December 2017: 26.0 per cent pro forma). The leverage ratio on a pro forma basis was in line with the start of the year at 5.3 per cent (31 December 2017: 5.4 per cent).</p><p>Tangible net assets per share increased 3.3 pence to 55.0 pence, pre dividends and share buy-back. This reflects a 3.5 pence increase for statutory profit, before a reduction of 0.8 pence for the PPI charge, and a 0.6 pence benefit from reserve movements. After reflecting the payment of the dividend and the impact of the share buy-back, equivalent to 2.9 pence, tangible net assets increased to 52.1 pence (1 January 2018: 51.7 pence).</p><p>Dividend</p><p>The Board has recommended an interim ordinary dividend of 1.07 pence per share, in line with our policy to maintain a progressive and sustainable ordinary dividend.</p><p>The Board will continue to give due consideration at each year end to the return of any surplus capital. In February this year, the Board decided to return surplus capital through a share buy back programme of up to £1 billion. This commenced in March 2018 and at the time of issuing results is c.75 per cent complete having purchased c.1.2 billion shares.</p><p><url normalizedValue=""https://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/globalassets/documents/investors/2018/2018_lbg_hy_results.pdf"">https://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/globalassets/documents/investors/2018/2018_lbg_hy_results.pdf</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">Bank of America Corp</emphasis></p><p>At Bank of America, we have a clear purpose to help make financial lives better through the power of every connection.

Citigroup’s effective tax rate was 24% in the current quarter compared to 32% in the second quarter 2017.</p><p>Citigroup’s allowance for loan losses was $12.1 billion at quarter end, or 1.81% of total loans, compared to $12.0 billion, or 1.88% of total loans, at the end of the prior-year period. Total non-accrual assets declined 20% from the prior-year period to $4.1 billion. Consumer non-accrual loans declined 16% to $2.4 billion and corporate non-accrual loans decreased 23% to $1.6 billion.</p><p>Citigroup’s end of period loanswere $671 billion as of quarter end, up 4% from the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation6 , Citigroup’s end of period loans grew 5%, as 6% aggregate growth in ICG and GCB was partially offset by the continued wind-down of legacy assets in Corporate / Other.</p><p>Citigroup’s end of period depositswere $997 billion as of quarter end, an increase of 4% from the prior-year period on both a reported and a constant dollar basis. The increase in constant dollars was driven by 9% growth in ICG, as GCB remained largely unchanged.</p><p>Citigroup’s book value per share of $71.95 and tangible book value per share of $61.29, both as of quarter end, were largely unchanged sequentially, as the benefit of a lower share count was offset by the aggregate impact to common equity of net income, share repurchases and dividends, as well as currency translation. At quarter end, Citigroup’s CET1 Capital ratio was 12.1%, unchanged sequentially, as net income was largely offset by the return of capital to common shareholders. Citigroup’s SLRfor thesecondquarter 2018was 6.6%, down slightly from 6.7% sequentially. During thesecondquarter 2018, Citigroup repurchased 33 million common shares and returned a total of $3.1 billion to common shareholders in the form of common share repurchases and dividends.</p><p>Global Consumer</p><p>Banking GCB revenuesof $8.3 billion increased 2%, driven by growth across all regions.

Citi-Branded Cards revenues of$2.1 billion decreased 1%. Excluding the impact of the Hilton portfolio sale, Citi-Branded Cards revenues increased 1% as the benefit of higher interest-earning balances and a gain of approximately $45 million related to the sale of Visa B shares were partially offset by the impact of previously disclosed items, including partnership terms and reprising actions related to APR rate re-evaluations undertheCARD Act. CitiRetail Servicesrevenues of $1.6 billion increased 1%, primarily reflecting continued loan growth.</p><p>Latin America GCB revenuesincreased 6% to $1.4 billion.

In constant dollars, revenues increased 2%, or 4% excluding the benefit of a modest gain on sale in the prior-year period. Retail banking revenues increased 4%, driven by growth in wealth management. Cards revenues remained largely unchanged; excluding the modest gain, revenues increased 4% driven by continued growth in loans and purchase sales.</p><p>GCB operating expenseswere $4.7 billion, up 3% on both a reported and a constant dollar basis, as efficiency savings were more than offset by higher investments, volume-related expenses and a provision of approximately $50 million for an industry-wide legal matter in North America GCB.</p><p>GCB cost of credit was $1.9 billion, up 8%. In constant dollars, cost of credit increased 9%, driven by an 8% increase in net credit losses reflecting volume growth and seasoning, primarily in North America GCB as well as a 27% increase in loan loss reserves as the prior-year period benefited from a reserve release in Asia GCB.</p><p>GCB net income of $1.3 billion increased 14%.

Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.3 billion increased 11%, reflecting higher volumes and improved deposit spreads with growth in both net interest and fee revenues. Investment Banking revenues of $1.4 billion were down 7% versus the prior-year period, as growth in advisory and equity underwriting was more than offset by a very strong prior year comparison in debt underwriting. Advisory revenues increased 14% to $361 million, equity underwriting revenues increased 8% to $335 million and debt underwriting revenues decreased 20% to $726 million. Private Bank revenues increased 7% to $848 million, driven by growth in clients, loans andinvestments, as well as improved deposit spreads. CorporateLendingrevenues of $589 million increased 22% (excluding gain / (loss) on loan hedges)7 , reflecting loan growth as well as lower hedging costs.</p><p>Markets and Securities Services revenues of $4.5 billion decreased 1%, as strong revenue growth in Equity Markets and Securities Services was more than offset by a decline in Fixed Income Markets. Fixed Income Markets revenues of $3.1 billion in the second quarter 2018 decreased 6%, driven by a more challenging market environment and a strong prior-year period comparison in G10 rates and securitized products. Equity Markets revenues of $864 million increased 19%, with growth across all products, reflecting the benefit of continued higher market volatility, as well as continued momentum with investor clients. Securities Services revenues of $665 million increased 12%, driven by continued growth in client volumes and higher net interest revenue.</p><p>ICG net income of $3.2 billion increased 17%, driven by the higher revenues, a lower tax rate and lower cost of credit, partially offset by higher operating expenses. ICG operating expenses increased 4% to $5.5 billion, driven by an increase in compensation costs, volume-related expenses and investments, partially offset by efficiency savings. ICG cost of credit declined due to a decrease in net credit losses as ICG recorded a net recovery of $1 million in the current period compared to net credit losses of $71 million in the prior-year period.</p><p>Corporate / Other</p><p>Corporate / Other revenuesof $528 million decreased 20% from the prior-year period, driven by the wind-down of legacy assets.</p><p>Corporate / Other expenses of $599 million decreased 40% from the prior-year period, driven by the wind-down of legacy assets and lower legal and infrastructure costs.</p><p>Corporate / Otherincome from continuing operations before taxes of$47 millionincreasedfrom a loss of$203 million in the prior-year period, as the lower expenses more than offset the lower revenues.</p><p><url normalizedValue=""https://www.citigroup.com/citi/investor/data/qer218.pdf?ieNocache=869"">https://www.citigroup.com/citi/investor/data/qer218.pdf?ieNocache=869</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">Capital One Financial Corp.</emphasis></p><p>Capital One is a diversified bank that offers a broad array of financial products and services to consumers, small business and commercial clients.

He made almost half of them, 40, at his December 18 rally in Battle Creek, Michigan on the night he was impeached -- a wild affair in which he spoke for two hours and one minute, nearly 20 minutes longer than his previous longest rally speech. </p><p nitf:lede=""true"">Trump's dishonesty at the rally ran the gamut of subjects -- from impeachment to the size of his crowds to how far Battle Creek residents need to drive to dispose of their fluorescent light bulbs.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">Trump's previous record for false claims in a rally speech was 36, in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania in 2018. His record for any kind of speech, 60 false claims, came in his longest address of any kind, an epic of two hours and two minutes at the Conservative Political Action Conference in March. </p><p>Trump's total of 81 false claims the week of the rally was tied for the fifth-highest weekly total of the 25 weeks we have tracked at CNN since July 8. </p><p>Trump made just nine false claims in the week from December 23 through December 29, the lowest of any week we have counted. Trump has been in Florida since December 20, and he has made few public remarks and had little on his public schedule since a 15-false-claim speech to conservative student group Turning Point USA on December 21.</p><p>Trump made 1,540 false claims between July 8 and December 29, about nine per day.</p><p>The most egregious false claim: Dishwasher dishonesty</p><p>Okay, it sounds kind of comedic when the President of the United States complains extremely inaccurately about dishwashers. But as we explained when we called this the most notable Trump lie of December, it's also serious stuff. Trump is using his false claim that modern dishwashers require more water and electricity than older dishwashers to try to sell an effort to weaken efficiency standards.</p><p>There is some possibility he is very confused rather than intentionally deceitful. But that would still be bad.</p><p>The most revealing false claim: Military planes</p><p>Trump makes false claims not only when trying to deceive low-information voters but when talking to people who are experts in the subject he is being inaccurate about.</p><p>During a Christmas Eve teleconference with members of the military, Trump told them that three years ago, before he was President, they had to use old planes, but that ""now you have all brand new.""</p><p>Members of the military are well aware of how wrong this is. As of late 2017, the average age of an Air Force plane was 28.3 years. Trump's administration has continued to order new planes since then, but ""all brand new"" remains false.</p><p>The most absurd false claim: The war on Christmas</p><p>Having promised in 2015 and 2016 that every store would use the phrase ""Merry Christmas"" again when he became President rather than ""Happy Holidays"" -- since, according to him, ""You don't ever see the word 'Christmas' anymore'"" -- Trump, naturally, claimed this December that all department stores are now saying ""Merry Christmas"" again.</p><p>That is false. Just as it was false when he said they had all stopped referring to Christmas in the first place.</p><p>Here is the full list of 90 false claims from December 14 through December 27, starting with the ones we haven't previously included in one of these roundups:</p><p>Democrats</p><p>Democrats and steel</p><p>Trump said of Democrats: ""They want to close up your steel mills. They don't want your steel mills."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: There may be some Democrats somewhere who want to shut down American steel mills, but this is not true of the party generally or of its leading presidential candidates.</p><p>Former Vice President Joe Biden, the leader in national polls of the Democratic presidential primary, says the federal government should use tariffs on low-cost ""dumped"" foreign steel in an effort to protect domestic steel producers. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is promising to create ""union, family-wage jobs"" in steel manufacturing. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has criticized the Trump administration for how it has granted exemptions to Trump's own steel tariffs -- complaining that the administration's acts have undermined American steel producers. South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is calling for ""net-zero emissions from industry, including steel and concrete, manufacturing, and agriculture sectors,"" by 2050 -- so environmental improvements in steel production, not the end of steel production. </p><p>Trump's unsubstantiated claims </p><p>Trump mocked journalists for calling it ""unsubstantiated"" when he says Joe Biden had told Ukrainian officials he would ""refuse to give $1 billion of taxpayer money to Ukraine unless they get the prosecutor to stop looking at your son and your son's company."" Trump said, ""He's on tape. He's -- if that were me, it's the electric chair. They would bring the electric chair back. No, the guy's on tape and they always say it's unsubstantiated."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: Trump's claims are unsubstantiated -- at best. There is no evidence Biden ever tried to get a Ukrainian prosecutor to stop investigating Burisma, the Ukrainian natural gas company where his son, Hunter Biden, had sat on the board of directors.</p><p>Rather, Joe Biden -- carrying out the policy of the US government and its European allies -- threatened to deny a $1 billion loan guarantee to Ukraine unless it fired a prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was widely seen as corrupt or ineffective; there is no sign Biden tried to thwart the Burisma case. Also, there is no evidence Hunter Biden was ever himself under investigation. And it is not even clear that Shokin was carrying out the investigation into Burisma or its owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, at the time Joe Biden applied the pressure; Shokin's former deputy, Vitaliy Kasko, has said that the investigation was dormant at the time: ""There was no pressure from anyone from the US to close cases against Zlochevsky. It was shelved by Ukrainian prosecutors in 2014 and through 2015."" </p><p>Joe Biden is ""on tape"" at a 2018 event telling the story of how he pushed for Shokin's firing, not ""on tape"" admitting he tried to stop any investigation or to help his son.</p><p>Biden's crowds</p><p>""So Biden has this rally, like you know, they got 200 seats -- but only a small number of people. So you know what they do? They set up a roundtable. So think of these people. They come in, they think they're gonna listen to the speech; they end up sitting at a roundtable, discussing. They must have been happy, right?"" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: We could not find any cases in which Biden was supposed to make a campaign speech but drew so few attendees that his campaign roped the people who did come into having a roundtable discussion with him instead. The Biden campaign told us this did not happen; the Trump campaign did not respond to a request to identify the event Trump was talking about.</p><p>Democrats and refugees</p><p>""Every Democrat running for president wants to open the floodgates to unlimited refugees from all around the world, overwhelming your communities and putting our national security at grave risk."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: Democratic presidential candidates do want to allow in a greater number of refugees than Trump has -- Trump has set a cap of 18,000 refugees for the current fiscal year, a historic low -- but it is not true that all of the candidates are proposing to allow ""unlimited refugees."" </p><p>For example, Biden calls for ""restoring refugee admissions in line with our historic practice under both Democratic and Republican Administrations""; his website says, ""He will set the annual global refugee admissions cap to 125,000, and seek to raise it over time commensurate with our responsibility, our values, and the unprecedented global need."" Warren wrote in July, ""I'll welcome 125,000 refugees in my first year, and ramping up to at least 175,000 refugees per year by the end of my first term."" </p><p>Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' plan says he would ""lift President Trump's refugee caps"" and does not include a specific desired number of refugees -- Sanders' campaign did not respond to a request for comment -- so it is possible to argue that Sanders is calling for ""unlimited refugees."" But that is not true of the entire field.</p><p>Michelle Obama, Bill Clinton and Michigan</p><p>Trump said that, on the last day of the 2016 election, ""Hillary, Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, and Bill Clinton -- they did an emergency trip. They did an emergency trip to Michigan at 6 o'clock."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: Michelle Obama and Bill Clinton did not go to Michigan for Hillary Clinton's rally in the state on the last day of the campaign, nor for President Barack Obama's rally in the state that day. Both Bill Clinton, who campaigned in North Carolina that day, and Michelle Obama joined Hillary Clinton, along with Barack Obama, at a nighttime rally in Philadelphia. </p><p>Hillary Clinton's final crowd in Michigan</p><p>Trump said that, at Hillary Clinton's ""emergency"" rally in Michigan the day before the election, ""She had 500 people."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: Clinton had a capacity crowd of more than 4,000 people for her rally at Grand Valley State University, according to local media reports at the time. Grand Rapids' Wood TV8 reported: ""In addition to the about 4,600 inside the Fieldhouse for Clinton's speech, there was an overflow crowd of several hundred more outside. People lined up hours beforehand to attend Clinton's 4 p.m. rally."" </p><p>This was not a one-time slip; Trump has repeatedly put Clinton's crowd at ""500."" </p><p>An unfair ""trial""</p><p>""Pelosi gives us the most unfair trial in the history of the U.S. Congress..."" -- December 23 tweet </p><p>Facts First: The House did not hold a ""trial"" at all. Under the Constitution, it is the Senate that has the sole power to try impeachments.</p><p>This is not merely a matter of semantics. During the House impeachment process, Republicans complained that Trump was being denied constitutional rights afforded to criminal defendants -- wrongly suggesting to the public that the House process was tantamount to a trial.</p><p>The Constitution and impeachment</p><p>""Worse still, I have been deprived of basic Constitutional Due Process from the beginning of this impeachment scam right up until the present. I have been denied the most fundamental rights afforded by the Constitution, including the right to present evidence, to have my own counsel present, to confront accusers, and to call and cross-examine witnesses..."" -- December 17 anti-impeachment letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi </p><p>Facts First: The constitutional rights of criminal defendants do not apply to public officials in a House of Representatives impeachment process, though Trump is free to argue that they should. Trump's counsel was denied the opportunity to participate in House Intelligence Committee impeachment hearings but was invited to participate in House Judiciary Committee hearings; Trump's counsel declined that opportunity. House Republicans were allowed to have their lawyer question witnesses at the House Intelligence Committee.</p><p>Trump's crowds</p><p>The crowd in Battle Creek</p><p>Trump referred to people standing in the crowd, then added, ""And I'm sorry we couldn't get you seats -- we didn't have any room. And by the way, 20,000 people outside had to leave. You know it's so cold outside we tell them, 'Don't worry about a screen. Go home, go home and watch.'"" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: We do not know the exact number of Trump supporters who were stuck outside because they were unable to get into his rally in Battle Creek, Michigan, but it was nowhere close to ""20,000."" (Trump has long exaggerated the number of people stuck outside his events.) </p><p>Battle Creek city spokesperson Jessica VanderKolk said in an email that the city's ""best guess"" was that there were ""about 1,000 people who were not allowed inside once the arena reached capacity."" Eric Greene, a former journalist and managing editor of the Battle Creek Enquirer newspaper who now works in public relations, wrote on Twitter: ""Trump just said there were 20,000 people who had to leave because they couldn't fit in the arena. This is blatantly FALSE. I know because I was outside the arena at the moment they closed the doors at approximately 5:45 p.m. At that time, a few hundred people quietly walked away."" </p><p>The Battle Creek arena had a capacity of about 5,500 for the Trump event, according to the city and local media. Brooks Hepp, a current Enquirer reporter, said in an email that he did not see the size of the overflow crowd at its peak, but he said ""the overflow area could not hold anywhere near 20,000 people, so that number is likely inaccurate."" He said he would offer a rough guess of ""probably 2,000-3,000 people at its peak and 1,000 by the time Trump started his speech.""</p><p>People leaving Trump rallies</p><p>Trump said nobody ever leaves his rally speeches: ""I know they're coming back, nobody ever leaves our speeches. Because is there a better place to be in the world than a Trump rally? Never. Nobody."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: This is simply not true. People have been seen leaving multiple Trump rally speeches before he has finished speaking -- including this very speech. The New York Times reported that ""as the speech went on, supporters began leaving in significant numbers or in some cases, appeared to doze off in their seats."" Michigan television station WKZO reported: ""Some supporters started to leave early as the rally ran past 9:45 p.m."" </p><p>Trump's venues</p><p>""I've had crowds over the last couple of weeks -- we went to different, Pennsylvania, Florida, but -- I mean, thousands and thousands of people can't get into these, you know, NBA arenas, right, big arenas. And we set records at every one, because we use the floor...But we use the floor, right, the basketball court. So we set records at every arena. They never even mentioned the crowds. They never mention the crowds, it's sort of amazing."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: Trump does sometimes hold rallies at NBA arenas, or at least NBA-sized arenas, but many of his venues are much smaller than that. Even when he has spoken in actual NBA arenas, it is not true that he has set a record every time. And it's not true that the media never mentions his crowds. To the contrary, his crowds are a regular subject of media attention.</p><p>Before he spoke at this Battle Creek, Michigan venue with an approximate capacity of 5,500 people, he spoke at a Hershey, Pennsylvania venue with an approximate capacity of 10,500; neither of them was an NBA venue. His venue before that was an NBA-sized venue in Sunrise, Florida -- the home of the Florida Panthers NHL team, with an approximate capacity of 20,000. </p><p>Trump does not set an attendance record each time he holds a rally in an NBA arena. The last actual NBA arena he spoke in was the American Airlines Center in Dallas. Jason Evans, a spokesman for the Dallas Fire-Rescue Department, told CNN that the fire department and the arena calculated an attendance of 18,500. The Dallas Mavericks, who play in the arena, had an average announced attendance of 20,013 per game last season, among the highest in the NBA, according to ESPN data.</p><p>It is obviously false that the media never even mentions Trump's crowds. The response of the crowd to his rhetoric is a regular part of media coverage of his rallies; media outlets regularly mention when a rally venue was filled to capacity; their stories regularly include quotes from people in the crowd. </p><p>Economy </p><p>Trade with Europe</p><p>Speaking of ""Europe"" supposedly taking advantage of the US on trade, Trump said, ""They don't take your product. They don't take your cars. They don't take your farm product. They don't take your medical machines. We do a big business, they sell us, we don't sell them, because they put restrictions. We have better equipment than them, but they make it so that our equipment doesn't qualify. You know, it's called artificial barriers or non-monetary barriers. It's brutal."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: While the European Union does have non-tariff barriers that make it costly or difficult for US businesses to export products there -- you can read here, for example, about some of the requirements the EU imposes on pork products -- it is a major exaggeration to say EU countries simply ""don't take"" US farm products, cars or medical devices. </p><p>As for farm products, the Office of the US Trade Representative says on its website: ""U.S. domestic exports of agricultural products to the EU totaled $13.5 billion in 2018. The EU countries together would rank 3rd as an Ag Export Market for the United States."" The same website says the US exported $27.7 billion worth of optical and medical instruments to the EU in 2018.</p><p>According to a European Automobile Manufacturers' Association report earlier this year, ""Today, the US is the fourth biggest exporter of cars to the European Union: 19% of the total value of US car exports heads for the EU, representing 12% of EU car imports by value."" The EU's Eurostat statistical office says that car imports from the US grew from 4 billion euros in 2002 to a peak of 7 billion euros in 2016, then fell to 6 billion euros in 2018. </p><p>Henry Ford and the assembly line</p><p>""This is the state where Henry Ford invented the assembly line."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: It is a popular belief that Ford invented the assembly line, but it is not correct. While Ford was the first to use a moving assembly line for the production of an automobile, Ransom Eli Olds was the first to use an auto assembly line of any kind; he used one to build his Oldsmobile Curved Dash cars at the beginning of the 1900s. (Olds' production also happened in Michigan.)</p><p>Olds' pioneering version of the assembly line was ""not a moving conveyor, as Henry Ford would install a decade later, but a parade of partially-completed cars swiveling from one work station to another on dollies,"" the National Museum of American History explains. </p><p>Inaccurate quotes from television</p><p>A Ben Domenech quote</p><p>""'This is political malpractice. This is a horrible judgement call on the part of the Speaker. You put your members in Trump friendly districts in a very difficult spot. It's only going to extend it out further. This looks like the joke that it actually is.' Ben Domenech."" -- December 19 tweet </p><p>Facts First: Trump omitted a significant part of this quote -- in which Domenech said on Fox News that he was referring specifically to Democrats in Trump-friendly districts ""who voted for the impeachment."" Trump's omission erased the fact that members in Trump-friendly districts voted against him. </p><p>We give Trump significant latitude to make errors when quoting people on television, but we call it a false claim when he alters the meaning of the quote with major changes or omissions.</p><p>An Andy McCarthy quote</p><p>""'In the end here, nothing happened. We don't approach anything like the egregious conduct that should be necessary before a President should be removed from office. I believe that a President can't be removed from office if there is no reasonable possibility that the Senate won't convict and remove the President - Then the House should not be Impeaching the President in the first place. If this is the new standard, every President from here on out is impeachable.' Andy McCarthy @FoxNews So well stated. Thank you!"" -- December 18 tweet</p><p>Facts First: Trump omitted a significant part of this quote on Fox News, too.</p><p>In between the second-to-last sentence in Trump's rendition of the quote (""the House should not be Impeaching the President in the first place"") and the last sentence in Trump's rendition (""If this is the new standard, every President from here on out is impeachable""), McCarthy said: ""To go back to Brett Baier's point earlier about the historic nature of today, yes, President Trump will in the history books from after today, from here on out, be remembered as one of the few presidents in history who are impeached. But I think history also has to be looked at in terms of what does this mean for the history of the United States. I don't think the President for long is going to be one of the handful of Presidents who is impeached, because...""</p><p>In other words, Trump omitted the fact that a friendly pundit said he would go down in history for being impeached.</p><p>A Ken Starr quote</p><p>""'The evidence has to be overwhelming, and it is not. It's not even close.' Ken Starr, Former Independent Counsel."" -- December 18 tweet</p><p>Facts First: Trump exaggerated Starr's comments. While Starr said on Fox News that it is ""just not the case"" that the evidence against Trump is ""overwhelming,"" Starr did not say ""it's not even close.""</p><p>Here's what Starr actually said: ""The evidence, whether it's circumstantial or direct -- and I think it's virtually entirely circumstantial -- has to be overwhelming; not just beyond a reasonable doubt, overwhelming to the American people who aren't sitting in a courtroom and listening to every witness testify and drawing inferences and so forth. When you read the abuse of power article in the Nixon impeachment, a fair-minded person looks at that, reads it, hears it and says he had got to go. That's just not the case here.""</p><p>A Doug Collins quote</p><p>""'They just wanted to get at the President. They had no intention of having a proper investigation. They couldn't find any crimes so they did a vague abuse of power and abuse of Congress, which every administration from the beginning has done.' @RepDougCollins @foxandfriends"" -- December 18 tweet </p><p>Facts First: As the Washington Post and New York Times both noted, Trump misquoted Collins -- adding in significant words that Collins did not utter.</p><p>Collins didn't say that ""every administration from the beginning"" had committed ""abuse of power and abuse of Congress."" He said: ""So they said, 'At the end of the day, we can't form any crimes. We're going to do a vague abuse of power. And while we're at it, let's just throw in abuse of -- obstruction of Congress, because we didn't get our way.'""</p><p>Environment, energy and regulation</p><p>Dishwashers</p><p>Trump compared modern dishwashers unfavorably to older dishwashers, saying he was proposing to change federal regulations. He said that, in the past, ""you press it, boom,"" and the dishwasher cycle would run and be finished in five minutes; ""now, you press it 12 times. Women tell me."" He added, ""By the way, by the time they press it 10 times, you spend more on water and electric. Don't forget. The whole thing is worse because you're spending all that money on electric."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: Trump's claims were comprehensively inaccurate. Energy-efficient modern dishwashers do not require people to press buttons 10 times or 12 times to start them. More importantly, those modern dishwashers use less water and electricity than older dishwashers, not more.</p><p>The federal government's website for the Energy Star energy efficiency program notes that Energy Star-certified dishwashers cut people's electricity bills and save water: ""A new ENERGY STAR certified dishwasher will save, on average, 3,870 gallons of water over its lifetime."" Consumer Reports wrote in October: ""Today's dishwashers use about half the water and energy that dishwashers used 20 years ago. Thanks to tougher federal efficiency standards, water usage is down to about 4 to 6 gallons per load -- and less water means less energy required to heat the water."" </p><p>It is possible that Trump was confused. Some conservative and industry groups have made a push to get the government to roll back efficiency standards for dishwashers. They argue that modern dishwashers take too long to finish. Trump might have thought that the longer run times mean more water and electricity use, but that is not true.</p><p>The disposal of fluorescent light bulbs in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>""When a light bulb is out, you've got to bring it to a dump. So let's say over here in Battle Creek, where's your nearest dump?"" [Trump appears to hear a response from a member of the crowd.] ""OK, that's what, a couple of hundred miles away. So every time you lose, drive a couple of hundred miles."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: It is not true that people in Battle Creek, Michigan need to drive ""a couple of hundred miles"" to dispose of fluorescent light bulbs. A spokesperson for the city of Battle Creek, Jessica VanderKolk, said there are two collection events per year in Battle Creek itself where people can turn in such bulbs, plus two more collection events per year in the county seat about 11 miles away.</p><p>In addition, major store chains, such as Home Depot and Lowe's, allow people to drop off fluorescent bulbs there for free recycling. (We confirmed with the Home Depot and Lowe's stores in the Battle Creek area that people can do so at those locations.) </p><p>An environmental ""fine"" to San Francisco or Los Angeles</p><p>Alleging environmental violations related to San Francisco's population of homeless people and people who inject drugs, Trump said, ""And we fined San Francisco -- and Los Angeles and San Francisco. But we've just sent them a tremendous dollar fine for what they're doing."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: There is no evidence that either San Francisco or Los Angeles has been fined. Trump's Environmental Protection Agency sent San Francisco a ""notice of violation"" in October, but that notice merely mentioned the potential for fines in the future. Will Reisman, spokesperson for the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, the entity to which the EPA notice was sent, told CNN, ""We have not received any fines from the EPA."" The office of Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said Los Angeles had not been fined either.</p><p>The EPA would not respond directly when asked if Trump's claim was correct. A spokesman told CNN to ask the White House, saying in an email: ""...EPA has issued [a notice of violation] to San Francisco for failing to protect water quality. For details on the Presidents remarks, please reach out to the WH. EPA does not discuss ongoing enforcement actions."" The White House declined to comment. </p><p>Penalties for killing bald eagles</p><p>Complaining that ""windmills"" (his word for wind turbines) kill birds in California, Trump said that, by contrast, ""If you shoot a bald eagle, they want to put you in jail for 10 years."" -- December 21 speech to Turning Point USA Student Action Summit </p><p>Facts First: Penalties for shooting a bald eagle are much shorter than 10 years. It wasn't clear whether Trump was talking about federal law or California law, but he was wrong either way. </p><p>The relevant federal laws do not include penalties nearly that long for killing a bald eagle, the National Audubon Society, a nonprofit that works to protect birds, told the Toronto Star in May, when Trump made a ""five years"" version of this claim; the penalties are up to two years under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, if someone knowingly shoots a bald eagle with intent to sell or barter it, and up to two years under the Bald and Gold Eagle Protection Act, the National Audubon Society noted. (As the federal government's Fish and Wildlife Service notes on its website, the maximum two-year penalty under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act is for a second conviction; a first conviction has a maximum penalty of one year.)</p><p>Patrick Foy, a captain in the law enforcement division for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, sent CNN the relevant section from the state's Fish and Game Code, which sets out the maximum state penalty for killing a bald eagle at a fine of $5,000, imprisonment in a county jail for a year or less, or both.</p><p>Bird deaths</p><p>""A windmill will kill many bald eagles. It's true. And you know what? After a certain number, they make you turn the windmill off. That's true, by the way. "" -- December 21 speech to Turning Point USA Student Action Summit</p><p>Facts First: While wind turbine operators are exempted from penalties only for a certain number of eagle deaths the federal government agrees to authorize, they are not forced to shut down if they exceed that number.</p><p>Wind turbine operators, like other entities whose activities accidentally kill birds, can apply for a permit of up to 30 years to kill a specified number of eagles without facing punishment. But companies whose operations have killed an unauthorized number of eagles are not forced to close; they may be compelled by the federal government to pay fines, make changes to their operations or try to find ways to reduce their impact on birds.</p><p>""It's not necessarily true that somebody's going to walk in the door and shut it down,"" Joel Merriman, director of the Bird-Smart Wind Energy Campaign at the American Bird Conservancy, told CNN. </p><p>For example, in 2016, the Fish and Wildlife Service touted four civil settlements over the previous 18 months that resulted in commitments from wind companies to pay $55,000 in penalties and to spend a minimum of $1.86 million over three years ""on research and development of avian detection and deterrent technologies."" Duke Energy agreed in a 2013 plea agreement with the Justice Department to pay $1 million in fines to conservation groups and to come up with a plan to avoid bird deaths in the future. </p><p>Trump might perhaps have been thinking of the well-known saga of the company Altamont Winds, which announced in 2015 that it would shut down its turbines in California's Altamont Pass. The turbines had been the subject of numerous complaints from bird advocates, but the shutdown was the company's own decision. </p><p>Sen. Mazie Hirono and the Green New Deal</p><p>""How about the senator from Hawaii? Nasty...She wants the Green New Deal, and then they informed her that that does not include airplanes. And you're the senator from Hawaii. So they said, 'What are you going to do?' And then they talked about building a train to Hawaii, can you believe it? No, no, she wants it, even though you can't -- you'll never get to Hawaii again. Say goodbye to Hawaii. No, it's crazy, isn't it, though?"" -- December 21 speech to Turning Point USA Student Action Summit</p><p>Facts First: It is not true that Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono decided to support the Green New Deal and then was informed afterward that the deal ""does not include airplanes,"" nor that she later started talking about building a train to Hawaii. Trump was mischaracterizing an exchange Hirono had with a reporter in February.</p><p>Here is what actually happened. When told by a reporter that the Green New Deal would try to eliminate air travel and move to high-speed rail across the country, Hirono said that would be ""pretty hard for Hawaii,"" then laughed. She did not explain her laughter at that moment, but as she explained later, the Green New Deal resolution Hirono had endorsed does not actually call for the elimination of air travel. </p><p>Rather, the resolution calls for ""overhauling transportation systems in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible, including through investment in zero-emission vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing; clean, affordable, and accessible public transit; and high-speed rail."" That is not a call to completely eliminate air travel.</p><p>So where did the reporter get his premise? Possibly from a controversial ""FAQ"" page posted by a leading Green New Deal proponent, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, which had urged the government to ""build out high-speed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary."" But other Democrats did not endorse the FAQ, just the official resolution, and Ocasio-Cortez's office quickly deleted it. </p><p>When Trump made a similar claim about Hirono, the Green New Deal and air travel in February, Hirono told HawaiiNewsNow: ""As usual, climate change denier Donald Trump makes things up and doesn't know what he's talking about. While the Green New Deal is an ambitious plan to combat climate change, it does not call for the elimination of air travel. I will continue to fight against this president's lies."" </p><p>Democrats and factories</p><p>""And what they want to do is they want to get rid of all petroleum product. That means you basically won't have any factories in the United States."" -- December 21 speech to Turning Point USA Student Action Summit</p><p>Facts First: It is true that some prominent Democratic candidates want the US to end the use of fossil fuels over time, but achieving an end to American petroleum use would not mean there would be no American factories.</p><p>Joshua Busby, an associate professor of public affairs at the University of Texas who studies energy and environmental policy, noted that manufacturers who simply require electricity to power their factories could get that electricity from renewable sources. ""Solar and wind are cost competitive across much of the United States with natural gas, and the lowest cost option in a number of locations,"" Busby said. And he noted that most US petroleum use is in transportation -- motor gasoline alone made up 46% of US petroleum use in 2018, according to the federal government -- not in industrial production; the use of vehicles that run without using petroleum could be greatly expanded. Some heavy industries ""will be difficult sectors to fully decarbonize and move to 100% renewables, but nobody is proposing to do that overnight,"" Busby said.</p><p>Accomplishments</p><p>Judicial appointments</p><p>""187 new Federal Judges have been confirmed under the Trump Administration, including two great new United States Supreme Court Justices. We are shattering every record!"" -- December 24 tweet </p><p>Facts First: Trump has set at least one important record on judicial appointments -- he has appointed more appeals court judges than any other president at this point in a term -- but not ""every record."" Notably, the statistic he cited in this tweet, 187 total judges confirmed, is not a record, according to Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks judicial appointments.</p><p>President Jimmy Carter had appointed 197 people to federal courts by December 20 of his third year in office, Wheeler said. If you go by the percentage of the judiciary appointed, both Carter (29%) and President Richard Nixon (31%) had Trump (21%) beat, according to data Wheeler provided to CNN. </p><p>Trump had appointed 50 people to the federal appeals courts as of December 20, according to Wheeler's data and recent news reports. Carter had appointed 48 by the same point of his own presidency. </p><p>Merry Christmas</p><p>""And did you notice that everybody is saying Merry Christmas again? Did you notice? Saying Merry Christmas."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>""And let me begin by wishing you a beautiful -- look, do you remember this? Do you remember they were trying to take 'Christmas' out of Christmas? Do you remember? They didn't want to let you say 'Merry Christmas.' You would go around, you'd see department stores that have everything -- red, snow, beautiful ribbons, bows. Everything was there, but they wouldn't say 'Merry Christmas.' They're all saying 'Merry Christmas' again. You remember? I went through that, during the campaign: 'They going to say Merry Christmas again.' And they are."" -- December 21 speech to Turning Point USA Student Action Summit</p><p>Facts First: There is no evidence that people are now saying ""Merry Christmas"" any more frequently than they did under previous presidents, nor that all stores that declined to use the phrase before Trump's presidency have changed their policies.</p><p>It's hard to measure this stuff, but one metric is the socially conservative American Family Association's annual list of retailers that it considers ""naughty"" or ""nice"" when it comes to its willingness to use the word ""Christmas"" in promotional materials. Not one of the 17 ""naughty"" companies the AFA listed in a press release in December 2015, the year Trump launched his presidential campaign, had been promoted to ""nice"" on the 2019 list, though two had moved from ""naughty"" to ""marginal."" </p><p>Military airplanes</p><p>""So we spent a lot of money on brand-new airplanes, as you know. We were -- three years ago, you didn't have brand-new airplanes. You were not doing well. And now you have all brand new."" -- December 24 teleconference with members of the military</p><p>Facts First: This was a major exaggeration. While Trump's administration has invested in new military planes, it is not even close to true that the planes currently in use are ""all brand new."" </p><p>In December 2018, the Congressional Budget Office reported that the average Air Force plane in 2017 was 28.3 years old: ""They range widely in age from the 75 new aircraft that entered service in 2017 to the 21 60-year-old KC-135 tankers that entered service in 1958. The largest share of the fleet is 26--30 years old."" The average age for fighter and attack planes was 26.4 years, for bombers 42.0 years, for tankers 53.7 years. </p><p>In addition, ""The military was buying new aircraft all throughout the Obama administration, like the F-35,"" said Todd Harrison, director of the Aerospace Security Project and director of Defense Budget Analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank.</p><p>Roger Stone's involvement in the Trump campaign</p><p>""You know, Roger Stone was not involved in my campaign in any way -- other than the very, very beginning, before I -- I think, I -- long before I announced -- a little bit."" And: ""And again, Roger Stone was not a part of it -- the campaign. He was somebody I've known over the years, but not a part of the campaign. Very, very, very early on -- long before I -- I think long before I even announced, he was involved in a minor way."" -- December 24 exchange with reporters after teleconference with members of the military </p><p>Facts First: Stone was involved in Trump's campaign after Trump announced his candidacy, not merely before. Trump announced his run in June 2015; Stone either resigned or was fired -- there is a dispute about what happened -- in August 2015, more than a month and a half into the campaign.</p><p>Prosecutors at Stone's trial this year -- which resulted in his conviction on charges of lying to Congress, witness tampering and obstructing a congressional committee proceeding -- introduced as evidence phone records that suggested Stone and Trump also spoke in 2016, after Stone's official role with the campaign ended. </p><p>The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals</p><p>""...how about the Ninth Circuit? Do you know that, as of next week -- do you know that we're going to be even on the Ninth Circuit? This was a disaster. We put a lot of judges on the Ninth Circuit."" -- December 21 speech to Turning Point USA Student Action Summit </p><p>Facts First: While Trump has made 10 appointments to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, whose decisions he has previously complained about, it was not true at the time he spoke that the 29-member court was going to be ""even"" by ""next week"" between judges appointed by Republicans and Democrats (""Next week"" has now passed.) The margin at the time was 16 Democratic appointees to 13 Republican appointees, and there were no additional vacancies for Trump to fill.</p><p>""Although it is true that President Trump has 'put a lot of judges on the Ninth Circuit,' there is no chance that it will be tied by 'next week.' In fact, it probably won't be tied by next year,"" said Arthur Hellman, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law and an expert on the Ninth Circuit. ""To get a tie (or better), two Democratic appointees would have to retire. All nine of the active judges appointed by President Clinton are eligible to retire, but I doubt that any of them will do so before the November election. Unless Democratic appointees retire or leave the bench (or Congress adds new judgeships), there can't be a Republican majority or even a tie.""</p><p>The Commission on Presidential Debates</p><p>""...3 years ago they were forced to publicly apologize for modulating my microphone in the first debate against Crooked Hillary."" -- December 16 tweet </p><p>Facts First: The Commission on Presidential Debates did not publicly apologize for Trump's microphone issue at the first debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton three years ago. (It also did not acknowledge any deliberate manipulation of Trump's microphone.) It issued a one-line statement that said: ""Regarding the first debate, there were issues regarding Donald Trump's audio that affected the sound level in the debate hall."" </p><p>Here are the claims Trump made over these two weeks that we have previously fact checked in one of these weekly roundups:</p><p>Foreign and military affairs</p><p>The US share of NATO </p><p>Trump said the United States used to pay for ""100% of NATO."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: According to the most recent official NATO figures, released in November 2019, US military spending represented between about 71% and about 73% of NATO members' total military spending in 2014, 2015 and 2016. That is a hefty percentage, but ""100%"" is an exaggeration. (The US share of NATO military expenditures has declined to about 69% per year under Trump.)</p><p>Previous presidents and NATO</p><p>Trump said previous presidents had not demanded military spending increases from NATO members: ""President Obama would go down to make a speech. 'I'd like to thank everybody for being here, thanks a lot, great job, sayonara, bye.' Bush, they all did. Nobody ever asked for money."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: It's not true that Obama and Bush never asked NATO members to increase their military spending. Obama and Bush both did so, though their public language was less confrontational than Trump's has been. </p><p>Obama repeatedly urged NATO allies to spend more. ""If we've got a collective defense, it means that everybody's got to chip in, and I've had some concerns about a diminished level of defense spending among some of our partners in NATO,"" Obama said in 2014. ""The situation in Ukraine reminds us that our freedom isn't free and we've got to be willing to pay for the assets, the personnel, the training that's required to make sure that we have a credible NATO force and an effective deterrent force.""</p><p>At Bush's final NATO summit, in 2008, Bush called on NATO allies to ""increase their defense investments to support both NATO and EU operations.""</p><p>The Coast Guard and Hurricane Harvey</p><p>""You know, the Coast Guard, with the work they've done during hurricane season, two years ago, in Texas -- in particular, Texas -- because they saved 16,000 lives. Nobody understands what that means -- 16,000. Even me -- I heard that number, and I said, 'Can that be possible? Sixteen thousand.' They served 16,000 lives -- and saved."" -- December 24 teleconference with members of the military</p><p>Facts First: The Coast Guard says the correct number is 11,022 people rescued. (This was not a one-time slip; Trump has regularly said ""16,000."") </p><p>Military pay increases</p><p>""But this Christmas, I hope that every member of our military will feel the overwhelming love and gratitude of our nation for your faithful service. Starting January 1st, you'll be getting your largest pay raise in more than a decade."" And: ""...it will be largest in over a decade, and you very much earned it. -- December 24 teleconference with members of the military</p><p>Facts First: Trump was exaggerating slightly when he said the troops will get their largest increase in ""more than"" and ""over"" a decade. Both the 2019 pay increase of 2.6% and the planned 2020 increase of 3.1% are the largest since 2010, so nine years and 10 years ago respectively.</p><p>(We know this is a minor stretch, but Trump has relentlessly embellished accurate numbers by adding words like ""over"" and ""more than,"" so it's a pattern of little dishonesty rather than a one-time error.)</p><p>NATO spending increases</p><p>""Over the last period of just two years. I raised -- not from us, nothing from us -- $130 billion, but that's nothing. And over a short period of time, they will be paying $530 billion more, all of those countries."" And: ""They have to pay -- $530 billion and the fake news doesn't want to even talk about it. They don't want to talk about it.'"" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: Trump's math was wrong: the $130 billion current increase in military spending by non-US NATO members (over 2016 levels) cannot be added to the $400 billion increase expected by 2024; the $400 billion figure includes the $130 billion. </p><p>NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg explained during a meeting with Trump on December 3 that non-US NATO members have added a total of $130 billion to their defense budgets since 2016. By 2024, Stoltenberg said, ""this number will increase to $400 billion."" </p><p>The history of NATO spending</p><p>Trump said of military spending by NATO members before he took office: ""I'm telling you, if you look, it's like 15 years, just down."" He drew a downward-sloping line in the air with his hand. -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: Military spending by NATO members had increased for two years prior to Trump's presidency. According to the latest NATO figures, released in November, spending increased by 1.7% in 2015 and 3.0% in 2016.</p><p>Veterans Choice</p><p>Trump said three times that he was the one who got the Veterans Choice program passed. He said once that people had been trying to do so for ""44 years,"" twice that people had been trying for almost ""50 years.""</p><p>Facts First: The Choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by senators Bernie Sanders and the late John McCain, was signed into law by Barack Obama in 2014. In 2018, Trump signed the VA Mission Act, which expanded and changed the program.</p><p>Military spending</p><p>Trump said twice that the US military has spent $2.5 trillion during his presidency.</p><p>Facts First: Trump was exaggerating. Defense spending for fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019 was $2.05 trillion, and that includes more than three-and-a-half months of Obama's tenure, since the 2017 fiscal year began in October 2016.</p><p>Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said he thinks Trump must have been including military funding for the 2020 fiscal year to get to the ""$2.5 trillion"" figure -- but the 2020 fiscal year just started on October 1, and Harrison noted that the defense appropriation has not yet been approved by Congress.</p><p>Economy and trade</p><p>Chinese tariffs </p><p>""As you know, we're now getting along very well with China and trade. In fact, they just took tariffs off more than 800 products, where they were charging us tariffs. And now those tariffs are gone."" -- December 24 teleconference with members of the military</p><p>Facts First: ""Gone"" was an exaggeration. China announced the day prior that it will lower, not eliminate, tariffs on more than 850 US products starting on January 1. </p><p>Manufacturing jobs </p><p>""Well, we've got 600,000 manufacturing jobs and you're going to see a big, big increase."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: Trump was exaggerating. The economy added 497,000 manufacturing jobs between January 2017, when Trump took office, and November 2019, official data shows. The number is 524,000 jobs added if you go back to November 2016, the month of Trump's election, as Trump often likes to do.</p><p>Hillary Clinton and the trade agreement with South Korea</p><p>""...the people that made these trade deals, it's like, where did they come? Like the one in Korea, that was a Hillary Clinton special. She said this will produce 250,000 new jobs, and I said, well, what happened? He said, well, she was right except it was for South Korea, not for us. So it produced 250,000 jobs for South Korea."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: There is no record of Hillary Clinton projecting an increase of 250,000 jobs because of the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS). President Barack Obama said the deal would ""support at least 70,000 American jobs.""</p><p>Obama said in 2009 that increasing the US share of trade with Asia from 9% to 10% ""could mean 250,000, 300,000 jobs,"" but he was not specifically attributing that estimate to the potential effects of a trade deal with South Korea. Republican Rep. Kevin Brady later used an estimate of ""about 250,000 new jobs"" from trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama combined, not just the one with South Korea.</p><p>Pelosi and USMCA </p><p>""The great USMCA Trade Deal (Mexico &amp; Canada) has been sitting on Nancy Pelosi's desk for 8 months, she doesn't even know what it says, &amp; today, after passing by a wide margin in the House, Pelosi tried to take credit for it..."" -- December 19 tweet </p><p>Facts First: The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement was not been sitting on Pelosi's desk for ""8 months"" before she agreed in December to have the Democrat-controlled House to pass it. Though the Trump administration had pushed Pelosi to persuade the House to quickly pass the agreement, it had not sent her any implementing legislation. </p><p>In fact, the President's trade team chose to negotiate with her to address the concerns of Democrats rather than immediately sending her a bill to which some of her party's caucus might have had significant objections.</p><p>Household income gains</p><p>""Total income gains for median households will reach $10,000 a family. I'll give you a couple of quick numbers. So under President Bush, for eight years, you saved $450, meaning you took in $450. OK, fine. Under President Obama, you took in $975. Under President Trump, including the energy savings and the regulation savings and the tax cuts savings, it's more than $10,000 in less than three years. Pretty good, right? So for two eight years, you had a $400, $450 and a $975. That's eight years, $450. In less than three years, you had more than $10,000. That goes right into your pockets."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: We can't fact check Trump's prediction that household income gains under him ""will"" reach $10,000 a family, but his claim that the number has already hit $10,000 in less than three years is inaccurate. A firm called Sentier Research has found pre-tax income gains of more than $5,00 between January 2017 and October 2019, but any gains from cuts to regulations or in reductions in energy prices would be included in this amount, not added on top of it. Also, it is entirely unclear what Trump is referring to when he talks about ""energy savings""; household energy costs have increased since Trump took office, as have gasoline costs. (Gasoline costs are lower than they were for most of Obama's presidency, but higher than they were in 2016.)</p><p>You can read a longer fact check here.</p><p>Japanese automakers and Michigan</p><p>""But Michigan's had the best year it's ever had. Best year it's ever had. And that's because we have auto companies expanding and thriving and they're coming in from Japan and they're coming in from a lot of other places."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: Japanese automakers have announced just two new US plants during Trump's presidency, and neither is to be built in Michigan.</p><p>Toyota and Mazda announced a joint venture in 2018 to build a plant in Alabama. Kristin Dziczek, vice president for industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research, said in November there had been only one other Japanese announcement of a new auto plant under Trump: Hino Motors' 2017 decision to move its West Virginia truck assembly operations to a bigger West Virginia location.</p><p>Prescription drug prices</p><p>""Our drug price is down for the first time in 51 years, drug prices came down..."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: Trump was exaggerating. The Consumer Price Index for prescription drugs showed a 0.6% decline between December 2017 and December 2018, which was the first calendar-year decline since 1972 -- the first decline in 46 years, not the first one in ""more than 50 years."" (As the Washington Post pointed out in its own fact check, some experts say the Consumer Price Index is a flawed measure of trends in drug prices, since it doesn't include rebates that drug companies pay to insurers. The IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science, which studies drug prices, found that ""net drug prices in the United States increased at an estimated 1.5% in 2018.</p><p>Obama and manufacturing</p><p>""Remember the statement by President Obama, 'You'd have to wave a magic wand.' Remember, the magic wand, because manufacturing. And I said, you know, that sounds strange. What do you do if you don't have manufacturing? How do you make things, right? 'Manufacturing jobs won't happen.'"" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: Trump's ""magic wand"" comment was a reference to a remark President Barack Obama made at a PBS town hall in 2016 -- but he was inaccurately describing what Obama said. Obama scoffed at Trump's promises to bring back what Obama called ""jobs of the past"" without providing specifics on how he would do so. Contrary to Trump's claims, though, Obama didn't say manufacturing was dead or that new manufacturing jobs could not be created; Obama boasted of how many manufacturing jobs were being created during his presidency, saying, ""We actually make more stuff, have a bigger manufacturing base today than we've had in most of our history.""</p><p>November jobs estimates</p><p>Trump boasted of the 266,000 jobs added in November, then said, ""And you know they said -- if you're a business watcher, which I am. I love watching business, but they said they were guessing: could be 70,000, could be 80,000, maybe 90, maybe 110, somebody said."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: While the number of jobs added by the US economy in November, 266,000, did exceed analysts' expectations, those expectations were much higher than Trump claimed. The median estimate from economists surveyed by Reuters was 180,000 jobs added -- and the lowest of the economists' estimates was 120,000 jobs added. </p><p>Trump did not specify who he was talking about when he repeatedly referred to an unnamed ""they"" and ""somebody""; it is certainly plausible that somebody somewhere thought that a mere 70,000, 80,000 or 90,000 jobs would be added. (His last number, 110,000, wasn't too far off from reality.) But Trump created the impression that he was talking about the expectations of economic experts.</p><p>Unemployment for women</p><p>Trump said twice that the unemployment rate for women was the best or lowest in ""71 years.""</p><p>Facts First: It had been 66 years, not 71 years, since the women's unemployment rate has been as low as it was in November, 3.5%. (That's if you ignore the 3.4% in September and April.)</p><p>Energy production</p><p>Trump said three times that he had ""ended the war on American energy,"" and ""the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas."" On a third occasion, he touted ""becoming the world's top energy producer"" as one of his accomplishments in office.</p><p>Facts First: The US has not just ""now"" become the world's top energy producer: it took the top spot in 2012, according to the US government's Energy Information Administration -- under the very Obama administration Trump is accusing of perpetrating a ""war"" on the industry.</p><p>The US became the top producer of crude oil in particular during Trump's tenure. ""The United States has been the world's top producer of natural gas since 2009, when US natural gas production surpassed that of Russia, and it has been the world's top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013, when its production exceeded Saudi Arabia's,"" the Energy Information Administration says.</p><p>Revenue from tariffs on China</p><p>""And you know, China's paying us billions and billions of dollars a year. They never gave us 10 cents."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: Americans make the actual tariff payments, and a bevy of economic studies, including a report in late November from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, have found that Americans are bearing the overwhelming majority of the tariff costs, Aside from the question of who is paying, it's not true that the Treasury has never received ""10 cents"" from tariffs on China. The US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries; FactCheck.org reported that the US generated an ""average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.""</p><p>Trump's claim also ignores China's hundreds of billions of dollars in purchases of US goods -- more than $300 billion during Trump's presidency alone.</p><p>The Mueller investigation</p><p>""Dirty cops"" at the FBI</p><p>Trump referred four times to former FBI director James Comey as a ""dirty cop.""</p><p>Facts First: We give Trump wide latitude to express opinions about public figures, but the December report from Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz presented no evidence that Comey was corrupt in any way. Horowitz found significant errors in FBI work connected to the Russia investigation, and rejected Comey's claim of vindication, but he did not make any finding accusing Comey of deliberate malfeasance.</p><p>The cost of the Mueller investigation</p><p>""After three years of unfair and unwarranted investigations, 45 million dollars spent..."" -- December 17 anti-impeachment letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi </p><p>""...but think of this, $45 million they spent..."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: The Mueller investigation Trump keeps saying cost ""$45 million"" actually cost $32 million, according to figures released by the Justice Department, and the government is expected to recoup about $17 million as a result of the investigation, most from former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, according to a CNN analysis of the sentences handed out to people charged by Mueller.</p><p>Ukraine and impeachment</p><p>What Biden said ""looked bad""</p><p>""Biden openly stated: 'I said, ""I'm telling you, you're not getting the billion dollars""... I looked at them and said: ""I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money."" Well, son of a bitch. He got fired.'"" Even Joe Biden admitted just days ago in an interview with NPR that it 'looked bad.'"" -- December 17 anti-impeachment letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</p><p>Facts First: Trump was not entirely clear on what he meant by ""it,"" but he left the impression that Biden had recently told NPR that his effort to oust Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, or the 2018 video of him telling the story of his effort to oust Shokin, ""looked bad."" In fact, Biden's ""looked bad"" comment was about something different: Hunter Biden's position on the board. Specifically, Biden said ""the appearance"" of Hunter Biden's presence on the board ""looked bad and it gave folks like Rudy Giuliani an excuse to come up with a Trumpian kind of defense.""</p><p>What Zelensky said</p><p>""President Zelensky has repeatedly declared that I did nothing wrong, and that there was No Pressure. He further emphasized that it was a 'good phone call,' that 'I don't feel pressure,' and explicitly stressed that 'nobody pushed me.'"" -- December 17 anti-impeachment letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</p><p>Facts First: Zelensky did say there had been ""no pressure"" from Trump and made other statements to that effect, but he has not gone so far as to say Trump did nothing wrong.</p><p>In an interview published by Time magazine in early December, Zelensky did say, ""Look, I never talked to the President from the position of a quid pro quo. That's not my thing."" But Zelensky continued: ""I don't want us to look like beggars. But you have to understand. We're at war. If you're our strategic partner, then you can't go blocking anything for us. I think that's just about fairness. It's not about a quid pro quo. It just goes without saying.""</p><p>The accuracy of the whistleblower</p><p>Trump criticized ""the so-called whistleblower who started this entire hoax with a false report of the phone call that bears no relationship to the actual phone call that was made."" -- December 17 anti-impeachment letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</p><p>Facts First: The whistleblower's account of Trump's July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been proven highly accurate. In fact, the rough transcript released by Trump himself showed that the whistleblower's three primary allegations about the call were correct or very close to correct. You can read a full fact check here.</p><p>The whistleblowers having ""disappeared""</p><p>""Once I presented the transcribed call, which surprised and shocked the fraudsters (they never thought that such evidence would be presented), the so-called whistleblower, and the second whistleblower, disappeared because they got caught, their report was a fraud, and they were no longer going to be made available to us."" -- December 17 anti-impeachment letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</p><p>Facts First: There is no evidence that either the first whistleblower (who filed the complaint about Trump's dealings with Ukraine) or the second whistleblower (whose lawyers said they had firsthand information corroborating claims made by the first whistleblower) are now somehow ""gone,"" let alone that they are ""gone"" because the first whistleblower was shown to be inaccurate.</p><p>""The whistleblowers have not vanished,"" Bradley Moss, a colleague of Mark Zaid, a lawyer for the two whistleblowers, said on Twitter in October, when Trump made another version of this claim.</p><p>The first whistleblower's lawyers, Zaid and Andrew Bakaj, wrote in the Washington Post in October: ""Because our client has no additional information about the president's call, there is no justification for exposing their identity and all the risks that would follow.""</p><p>The existence of the second whistleblower -- who never planned to file a separate whistleblower complaint -- was revealed after Trump released the rough transcript of his call with Zelensky, not before.</p><p>The Salem Witch Trials</p><p>""More due process was afforded to those accused in the Salem Witch Trials."" -- December 17 anti-impeachment letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi </p><p>Facts First: Trump might have meant this as a non-literal figure of speech, but as a factual matter, the claim is absurd. (Salem's current mayor told Trump to ""learn some history."") Nineteen innocent people were hanged after they were accused of witchcraft in the trials of the late 1600s. The courts accepted ""spectral evidence"" from dreams. Some of the accused were tortured into confessions.</p><p>The rough transcript</p><p>""Fortunately, there was a transcript of the conversation taken, and you know from the transcript (which was immediately made available) that the paragraph in question was perfect."" -- December 17 anti-impeachment letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</p><p>Facts First: The call occurred in July. Trump released the rough transcript in September, after the public learned of the existence of the whistleblower complaint about the call and after a series of news reports that raised questions about the call. (The Washington Post reported at the time: ""Trump's decision to release the transcript follows nearly a week of speculation around what he specifically asked for during a call that an intelligence official found so problematic he filed an official complaint."") </p><p>Immigration</p><p>Mexican soldiers and the border</p><p>""And, as you know, we have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our border right now protecting our border."" -- December 17 remarks at meeting with Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales </p><p>Facts First: Mexico has deployed around 27,000 troops, but Trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the US border in particular. CNN reported on November 2: ""Nearly 15,000 troops are deployed to Mexico's northern border, where they've set up 20 checkpoints, Mexican Defense Minister Luis Cresencio Sandoval said last week at a press briefing on the country's security strategy. At the southern border, 12,000 troops are deployed and have set up 21 checkpoints.""</p><p>Acting US Customs and Border Protection commissioner Mark Morgan has offered similar numbers, telling reporters in September that 10,000 of approximately 25,000 troops were on Mexico's southern border.</p><p>Deportations to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador</p><p>""One of the big things that's happened with Guatemala -- and Honduras, El Salvador, and some others -- is that, in past administrations, they and others would not take people back. So if we had very dangerous people in our country and they came from Guatemala, or another country that we now have agreements with -- we never had agreements with anybody -- they just wouldn't take them back. But now they have to take them back, and they take them back with open arms."" -- December 17 remarks at meeting with Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales</p><p>""And we have agreements now with Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador -- you know they didn't use to take them back. If we had a murderer and we said 'get them the hell out, you know, we don't really want them in our prisons and take care of them for 50, 60 years. We want to bring them back,' they wouldn't take them. The planes used to go around and around -- 'Don't land, don't land.' With us, they land. We worked at deals with every one of them. We stop giving them all the aid. You know we're giving them all this money and then they said, 'We're not going to let you land, we're not going to let you take them back.'"" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: Trump was mixing up two separate issues. While the Trump administration does have new agreements with all three of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, those agreements are related to the handling of people who come to the US seeking asylum, not criminals the US is seeking to deport. In 2016, just prior to Trump's presidency, none of the three countries was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered ""recalcitrant"" (uncooperative) in accepting the return of their citizens from the US.</p><p>You can read a longer fact check in this article. </p><p>Democrats and borders, part 1</p><p>Trump said twice that Democrats support a policy of ""open borders."" On a third occasion, he made this accusation specifically about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.</p><p>Facts First: Even 2020 Democratic presidential candidates who advocate the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, do not support completely unrestricted migration, as Trump suggests.</p><p>While Pelosi wants a more liberal immigration policy than Trump does, she has repeatedly endorsed funding for border security measures aside from the President's proposed wall.</p><p>Democrats and borders, part 2</p><p>""The Democrat Party is trying to shred our Constitution, tear down our history, erase the nation's borders. They don't want to have any borders."" -- December 21 speech to Turning Point USA Student Action Summit </p><p>Facts First: This claim is baseless. The Democratic Party is not trying to eliminate borders. </p><p>Accomplishments</p><p>The Electoral College result in 2016 </p><p>""Your chosen candidate lost the election in 2016, in an Electoral College landslide (306-227), and you and your party have never recovered from this defeat."" -- December 17 anti-impeachment letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</p><p>Facts First: Leaving aside Trump's characterization of the result as a ""landslide,"" he got the numbers wrong -- again. If he was going by the number of electoral votes each candidate earned in the voting, the result was 306 for him to 232 for Clinton. If he was going by the final result, after some ""faithless electors"" defected from both him and Clinton, the result was 304 for him to 227 for Clinton. This was not a one-time slip; Trump is habitually inaccurate about this.</p><p>Right to Try</p><p>Trump said that people have been trying to get a national Right to Try law passed for 49 years: ""They've been trying to do it for 49 years."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: There had not been a 49-year push to get such a law passed before Trump signed it in May 2018. (The law aims to make it easier for terminally ill patients to access medications that have not been granted final approval.) Similar laws have been passed at the state level only since 2014, after the Goldwater Institute, a libertarian think tank, began pushing for them.</p><p>""I have no idea what 'they've been trying to get' for 44 years,"" Alison Bateman-House, assistant professor of medical ethics at New York University's Langone Health, said in response to a previous version of Trump's claim. ""The Right to Try law was a creation of the Goldwater Institute, and it first became state law in 2014 (in Colorado), relatively soon after it was first conceived of.</p><p>Michigan's ""Man of the Year""</p><p>Trump said twice that he was named ""Man of the Year"" in Michigan about 10 years ago.</p><p>Facts First: CNN and other news outlets have found no evidence Trump was ever named Michigan's man of the year. You can read our full fact check on this claim here. </p><p>Trump's crowds </p><p>On separate occasions, Trump said that ""I've never had an empty seat"" and that ""I don't think we've ever had an empty seat from the time I came down the escalator.""</p><p>Facts First: There have been empty seats at various Trump rallies, including an October rally Minneapolis, a July rally in Greenville, North Carolina, an October 2018 rally in Houston and an April 2017 rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, according to journalists on the scene.</p><p>The media</p><p>Newspapers' election polls</p><p>""The problem is the newspaper polls are more fake than the news they write. They write fake polls. It's true. They write fake polls. You call them suppression polls. You read them and you get depressed because it looks like you're doing badly. They do that. I think it's almost worse than what they write, and you can't get much worse than what they write."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: There is simply no evidence that newspaper pollsters have manipulated their numbers to suppress the enthusiasm of Trump voters, as Trump has repeatedly alleged.</p><p>A CNN camera</p><p>Trump praised Fox News host Laura Ingraham, then said, ""You know, now the CNN -- the CNN cameras -- all the cameras just turned off. That's okay. They don't want to promote Laura."" -- December 21 speech to Turning Point USA Student Action Summit </p><p>Facts First: CNN did not turn off its camera as Trump promoted Ingraham; it was serving as the ""pool"" camera feeding the speech to various networks. And CNN did not stop broadcasting Trump's speech; CNN was not even airing the speech live on television. (Also, CNN's photojournalists at Trump events have the ""tally"" lights on their cameras set permanently to off, so Trump would have no way of seeing from the stage even if they did ever turn a camera off.) Trump has repeatedly made versions of this false claim. </p><p>Judges</p><p>Obama's judicial vacancies</p><p>Trumps said twice that President Barack Obama left him ""142"" judicial vacancies.</p><p>Facts First: Trump exaggerated. According to Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks judicial appointments, there were 103 vacancies on district and appeals courts on Jan. 1, 2017, just before Trump took office, plus a vacancy on the Supreme Court.</p><p>For database:</p><p>The history of judicial vacancies</p><p>Mocking Obama for supposedly leaving him ""142"" judicial vacancies -- we explained in the item above that this figure is inaccurate -- Trump said, ""I mean, normally, when you leave office, you leave none. You leave none."" -- December 21 speech to Turning Point USA Student Action Summit</p><p>Facts First: It's not true that outgoing presidents usually leave no judicial vacancies to their successors. According to Wheeler, there were 53 vacancies on January 1, 2009, just before Obama took office; 80 vacancies on January 1, 2001, just before George W. Bush took office; 107 vacancies on January 1, 1993, just before Bill Clinton took office.</p><p>So Trump had the most judges to appoint since Clinton, but, clearly, other presidents also had appointing to do.</p><p>Pre-existing conditions</p><p>""Republicans will strongly protect patients with pre-existing conditions."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>""We take care of pre-existing conditions. They're not going to be able to do that. -- December 19 remarks at meeting with Rep. Jeff Van Drew </p><p>Facts First: Democrats already did ""take care of"" pre-existing conditions: they created protections for people with such conditions in the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, the law they passed in 2010 over Republican opposition. </p><p>The Trump administration and congressional Republicans have repeatedly put forward bills and filed lawsuits that would weaken Obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Trump is currently supporting a Republican lawsuit that is seeking to declare all of Obamacare void. He has not issued a plan to reinstate the law's protections for people with pre-existing conditions if the suit succeeds.</p><p>TM &amp; © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

He made almost half of them, 40, at his December 18 rally in Battle Creek, Michigan on the night he was impeached -- a wild affair in which he spoke for two hours and one minute, nearly 20 minutes longer than his previous longest rally speech.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">Trump's dishonesty at the rally ran the gamut of subjects -- from impeachment to the size of his crowds to how far Battle Creek residents need to drive to dispose of their fluorescent light bulbs.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">Trump's previous record for false claims in a rally speech was 36, in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania in 2018. His record for any kind of speech, 60 false claims, came in his longest address of any kind, an epic of two hours and two minutes at the Conservative Political Action Conference in March.</p><p>Trump's total of 81 false claims the week of the rally was tied for the fifth-highest weekly total of the 25 weeks we have tracked at CNN since July 8.</p><p>Trump made just nine false claims in the week from December 23 through December 29, the lowest of any week we have counted. Trump has been in Florida since December 20, and he has made few public remarks and had little on his public schedule since a 15-false-claim speech to conservative student group Turning Point USA on December 21.</p><p>Trump made 1,540 false claims between July 8 and December 29, about nine per day.</p><p>The most egregious false claim: Dishwasher dishonesty</p><p>Okay, it sounds kind of comedic when the President of the United States complains extremely inaccurately about dishwashers. But as we explained when we called this the most notable Trump lie of December, it's also serious stuff. Trump is using his false claim that modern dishwashers require more water and electricity than older dishwashers to try to sell an effort to weaken efficiency standards.</p><p>There is some possibility he is very confused rather than intentionally deceitful. But that would still be bad.</p><p>The most revealing false claim: Military planes</p><p>Trump makes false claims not only when trying to deceive low-information voters but when talking to people who are experts in the subject he is being inaccurate about.</p><p>During a Christmas Eve teleconference with members of the military, Trump told them that three years ago, before he was President, they had to use old planes, but that ""now you have all brand new.""</p><p>Members of the military are well aware of how wrong this is. As of late 2017, the average age of an Air Force plane was 28.3 years. Trump's administration has continued to order new planes since then, but ""all brand new"" remains false.</p><p>The most absurd false claim: The war on Christmas</p><p>Having promised in 2015 and 2016 that every store would use the phrase ""Merry Christmas"" again when he became President rather than ""Happy Holidays"" -- since, according to him, ""You don't ever see the word 'Christmas' anymore'"" -- Trump, naturally, claimed this December that all department stores are now saying ""Merry Christmas"" again.</p><p>That is false. Just as it was false when he said they had all stopped referring to Christmas in the first place.</p><p>Here is the full list of 90 false claims from December 14 through December 27, starting with the ones we haven't previously included in one of these roundups:</p><p>Democrats</p><p>Democrats and steel</p><p>Trump said of Democrats: ""They want to close up your steel mills. They don't want your steel mills."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: There may be some Democrats somewhere who want to shut down American steel mills, but this is not true of the party generally or of its leading presidential candidates.</p><p>Former Vice President Joe Biden, the leader in national polls of the Democratic presidential primary, says the federal government should use tariffs on low-cost ""dumped"" foreign steel in an effort to protect domestic steel producers. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is promising to create ""union, family-wage jobs"" in steel manufacturing. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has criticized the Trump administration for how it has granted exemptions to Trump's own steel tariffs -- complaining that the administration's acts have undermined American steel producers. South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is calling for ""net-zero emissions from industry, including steel and concrete, manufacturing, and agriculture sectors,"" by 2050 -- so environmental improvements in steel production, not the end of steel production.</p><p>Trump's unsubstantiated claims</p><p>Trump mocked journalists for calling it ""unsubstantiated"" when he says Joe Biden had told Ukrainian officials he would ""refuse to give $1 billion of taxpayer money to Ukraine unless they get the prosecutor to stop looking at your son and your son's company."" Trump said, ""He's on tape. He's -- if that were me, it's the electric chair. They would bring the electric chair back. No, the guy's on tape and they always say it's unsubstantiated."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: Trump's claims are unsubstantiated -- at best. There is no evidence Biden ever tried to get a Ukrainian prosecutor to stop investigating Burisma, the Ukrainian natural gas company where his son, Hunter Biden, had sat on the board of directors.</p><p>Rather, Joe Biden -- carrying out the policy of the US government and its European allies -- threatened to deny a $1 billion loan guarantee to Ukraine unless it fired a prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was widely seen as corrupt or ineffective; there is no sign Biden tried to thwart the Burisma case. Also, there is no evidence Hunter Biden was ever himself under investigation. And it is not even clear that Shokin was carrying out the investigation into Burisma or its owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, at the time Joe Biden applied the pressure; Shokin's former deputy, Vitaliy Kasko, has said that the investigation was dormant at the time: ""There was no pressure from anyone from the US to close cases against Zlochevsky. It was shelved by Ukrainian prosecutors in 2014 and through 2015.""</p><p>Joe Biden is ""on tape"" at a 2018 event telling the story of how he pushed for Shokin's firing, not ""on tape"" admitting he tried to stop any investigation or to help his son.</p><p>Biden's crowds</p><p>""So Biden has this rally, like you know, they got 200 seats -- but only a small number of people. So you know what they do? They set up a roundtable. So think of these people. They come in, they think they're gonna listen to the speech; they end up sitting at a roundtable, discussing. They must have been happy, right?"" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: We could not find any cases in which Biden was supposed to make a campaign speech but drew so few attendees that his campaign roped the people who did come into having a roundtable discussion with him instead. The Biden campaign told us this did not happen; the Trump campaign did not respond to a request to identify the event Trump was talking about.</p><p>Democrats and refugees</p><p>""Every Democrat running for president wants to open the floodgates to unlimited refugees from all around the world, overwhelming your communities and putting our national security at grave risk."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: Democratic presidential candidates do want to allow in a greater number of refugees than Trump has -- Trump has set a cap of 18,000 refugees for the current fiscal year, a historic low -- but it is not true that all of the candidates are proposing to allow ""unlimited refugees.""</p><p>For example, Biden calls for ""restoring refugee admissions in line with our historic practice under both Democratic and Republican Administrations""; his website says, ""He will set the annual global refugee admissions cap to 125,000, and seek to raise it over time commensurate with our responsibility, our values, and the unprecedented global need."" Warren wrote in July, ""I'll welcome 125,000 refugees in my first year, and ramping up to at least 175,000 refugees per year by the end of my first term.""</p><p>Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' plan says he would ""lift President Trump's refugee caps"" and does not include a specific desired number of refugees -- Sanders' campaign did not respond to a request for comment -- so it is possible to argue that Sanders is calling for ""unlimited refugees."" But that is not true of the entire field.</p><p>Michelle Obama, Bill Clinton and Michigan</p><p>Trump said that, on the last day of the 2016 election, ""Hillary, Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, and Bill Clinton -- they did an emergency trip. They did an emergency trip to Michigan at 6 o'clock."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: Michelle Obama and Bill Clinton did not go to Michigan for Hillary Clinton's rally in the state on the last day of the campaign, nor for President Barack Obama's rally in the state that day. Both Bill Clinton, who campaigned in North Carolina that day, and Michelle Obama joined Hillary Clinton, along with Barack Obama, at a nighttime rally in Philadelphia.</p><p>Hillary Clinton's final crowd in Michigan</p><p>Trump said that, at Hillary Clinton's ""emergency"" rally in Michigan the day before the election, ""She had 500 people."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: Clinton had a capacity crowd of more than 4,000 people for her rally at Grand Valley State University, according to local media reports at the time. Grand Rapids' Wood TV8 reported: ""In addition to the about 4,600 inside the Fieldhouse for Clinton's speech, there was an overflow crowd of several hundred more outside. People lined up hours beforehand to attend Clinton's 4 p.m. rally.""</p><p>This was not a one-time slip; Trump has repeatedly put Clinton's crowd at ""500.""</p><p>An unfair ""trial""</p><p>""Pelosi gives us the most unfair trial in the history of the U.S. Congress..."" -- December 23 tweet</p><p>Facts First: The House did not hold a ""trial"" at all. Under the Constitution, it is the Senate that has the sole power to try impeachments.</p><p>This is not merely a matter of semantics. During the House impeachment process, Republicans complained that Trump was being denied constitutional rights afforded to criminal defendants -- wrongly suggesting to the public that the House process was tantamount to a trial.</p><p>The Constitution and impeachment</p><p>""Worse still, I have been deprived of basic Constitutional Due Process from the beginning of this impeachment scam right up until the present. I have been denied the most fundamental rights afforded by the Constitution, including the right to present evidence, to have my own counsel present, to confront accusers, and to call and cross-examine witnesses..."" -- December 17 anti-impeachment letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</p><p>Facts First: The constitutional rights of criminal defendants do not apply to public officials in a House of Representatives impeachment process, though Trump is free to argue that they should. Trump's counsel was denied the opportunity to participate in House Intelligence Committee impeachment hearings but was invited to participate in House Judiciary Committee hearings; Trump's counsel declined that opportunity. House Republicans were allowed to have their lawyer question witnesses at the House Intelligence Committee.</p><p>Trump's crowds</p><p>The crowd in Battle Creek</p><p>Trump referred to people standing in the crowd, then added, ""And I'm sorry we couldn't get you seats -- we didn't have any room. And by the way, 20,000 people outside had to leave. You know it's so cold outside we tell them, 'Don't worry about a screen. Go home, go home and watch.'"" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: We do not know the exact number of Trump supporters who were stuck outside because they were unable to get into his rally in Battle Creek, Michigan, but it was nowhere close to ""20,000."" (Trump has long exaggerated the number of people stuck outside his events.)</p><p>Battle Creek city spokesperson Jessica VanderKolk said in an email that the city's ""best guess"" was that there were ""about 1,000 people who were not allowed inside once the arena reached capacity."" Eric Greene, a former journalist and managing editor of the Battle Creek Enquirer newspaper who now works in public relations, wrote on Twitter: ""Trump just said there were 20,000 people who had to leave because they couldn't fit in the arena. This is blatantly FALSE. I know because I was outside the arena at the moment they closed the doors at approximately 5:45 p.m. At that time, a few hundred people quietly walked away.""</p><p>The Battle Creek arena had a capacity of about 5,500 for the Trump event, according to the city and local media. Brooks Hepp, a current Enquirer reporter, said in an email that he did not see the size of the overflow crowd at its peak, but he said ""the overflow area could not hold anywhere near 20,000 people, so that number is likely inaccurate."" He said he would offer a rough guess of ""probably 2,000-3,000 people at its peak and 1,000 by the time Trump started his speech.""</p><p>People leaving Trump rallies</p><p>Trump said nobody ever leaves his rally speeches: ""I know they're coming back, nobody ever leaves our speeches. Because is there a better place to be in the world than a Trump rally? Never. Nobody."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: This is simply not true. People have been seen leaving multiple Trump rally speeches before he has finished speaking -- including this very speech. The New York Times reported that ""as the speech went on, supporters began leaving in significant numbers or in some cases, appeared to doze off in their seats."" Michigan television station WKZO reported: ""Some supporters started to leave early as the rally ran past 9:45 p.m.""</p><p>Trump's venues</p><p>""I've had crowds over the last couple of weeks -- we went to different, Pennsylvania, Florida, but -- I mean, thousands and thousands of people can't get into these, you know, NBA arenas, right, big arenas. And we set records at every one, because we use the floor...But we use the floor, right, the basketball court. So we set records at every arena. They never even mentioned the crowds. They never mention the crowds, it's sort of amazing."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: Trump does sometimes hold rallies at NBA arenas, or at least NBA-sized arenas, but many of his venues are much smaller than that. Even when he has spoken in actual NBA arenas, it is not true that he has set a record every time. And it's not true that the media never mentions his crowds. To the contrary, his crowds are a regular subject of media attention.</p><p>Before he spoke at this Battle Creek, Michigan venue with an approximate capacity of 5,500 people, he spoke at a Hershey, Pennsylvania venue with an approximate capacity of 10,500; neither of them was an NBA venue. His venue before that was an NBA-sized venue in Sunrise, Florida -- the home of the Florida Panthers NHL team, with an approximate capacity of 20,000.</p><p>Trump does not set an attendance record each time he holds a rally in an NBA arena. The last actual NBA arena he spoke in was the American Airlines Center in Dallas. Jason Evans, a spokesman for the Dallas Fire-Rescue Department, told CNN that the fire department and the arena calculated an attendance of 18,500. The Dallas Mavericks, who play in the arena, had an average announced attendance of 20,013 per game last season, among the highest in the NBA, according to ESPN data.</p><p>It is obviously false that the media never even mentions Trump's crowds. The response of the crowd to his rhetoric is a regular part of media coverage of his rallies; media outlets regularly mention when a rally venue was filled to capacity; their stories regularly include quotes from people in the crowd.</p><p>Economy</p><p>Trade with Europe</p><p>Speaking of ""Europe"" supposedly taking advantage of the US on trade, Trump said, ""They don't take your product. They don't take your cars. They don't take your farm product. They don't take your medical machines. We do a big business, they sell us, we don't sell them, because they put restrictions. We have better equipment than them, but they make it so that our equipment doesn't qualify. You know, it's called artificial barriers or non-monetary barriers. It's brutal."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: While the European Union does have non-tariff barriers that make it costly or difficult for US businesses to export products there -- you can read here, for example, about some of the requirements the EU imposes on pork products -- it is a major exaggeration to say EU countries simply ""don't take"" US farm products, cars or medical devices.</p><p>As for farm products, the Office of the US Trade Representative says on its website: ""U.S. domestic exports of agricultural products to the EU totaled $13.5 billion in 2018. The EU countries together would rank 3rd as an Ag Export Market for the United States."" The same website says the US exported $27.7 billion worth of optical and medical instruments to the EU in 2018.</p><p>According to a European Automobile Manufacturers' Association report earlier this year, ""Today, the US is the fourth biggest exporter of cars to the European Union: 19% of the total value of US car exports heads for the EU, representing 12% of EU car imports by value."" The EU's Eurostat statistical office says that car imports from the US grew from 4 billion euros in 2002 to a peak of 7 billion euros in 2016, then fell to 6 billion euros in 2018.</p><p>Henry Ford and the assembly line</p><p>""This is the state where Henry Ford invented the assembly line."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: It is a popular belief that Ford invented the assembly line, but it is not correct. While Ford was the first to use a moving assembly line for the production of an automobile, Ransom Eli Olds was the first to use an auto assembly line of any kind; he used one to build his Oldsmobile Curved Dash cars at the beginning of the 1900s. (Olds' production also happened in Michigan.)</p><p>Olds' pioneering version of the assembly line was ""not a moving conveyor, as Henry Ford would install a decade later, but a parade of partially-completed cars swiveling from one work station to another on dollies,"" the National Museum of American History explains.</p><p>Inaccurate quotes from television</p><p>A Ben Domenech quote</p><p>""'This is political malpractice. This is a horrible judgement call on the part of the Speaker. You put your members in Trump friendly districts in a very difficult spot. It's only going to extend it out further. This looks like the joke that it actually is.' Ben Domenech."" -- December 19 tweet</p><p>Facts First: Trump omitted a significant part of this quote -- in which Domenech said on Fox News that he was referring specifically to Democrats in Trump-friendly districts ""who voted for the impeachment."" Trump's omission erased the fact that members in Trump-friendly districts voted against him.</p><p>We give Trump significant latitude to make errors when quoting people on television, but we call it a false claim when he alters the meaning of the quote with major changes or omissions.</p><p>An Andy McCarthy quote</p><p>""'In the end here, nothing happened. We don't approach anything like the egregious conduct that should be necessary before a President should be removed from office. I believe that a President can't be removed from office if there is no reasonable possibility that the Senate won't convict and remove the President - Then the House should not be Impeaching the President in the first place. If this is the new standard, every President from here on out is impeachable.' Andy McCarthy @FoxNews So well stated. Thank you!"" -- December 18 tweet</p><p>Facts First: Trump omitted a significant part of this quote on Fox News, too.</p><p>In between the second-to-last sentence in Trump's rendition of the quote (""the House should not be Impeaching the President in the first place"") and the last sentence in Trump's rendition (""If this is the new standard, every President from here on out is impeachable""), McCarthy said: ""To go back to Brett Baier's point earlier about the historic nature of today, yes, President Trump will in the history books from after today, from here on out, be remembered as one of the few presidents in history who are impeached. But I think history also has to be looked at in terms of what does this mean for the history of the United States. I don't think the President for long is going to be one of the handful of Presidents who is impeached, because...""</p><p>In other words, Trump omitted the fact that a friendly pundit said he would go down in history for being impeached.</p><p>A Ken Starr quote</p><p>""'The evidence has to be overwhelming, and it is not. It's not even close.' Ken Starr, Former Independent Counsel."" -- December 18 tweet</p><p>Facts First: Trump exaggerated Starr's comments. While Starr said on Fox News that it is ""just not the case"" that the evidence against Trump is ""overwhelming,"" Starr did not say ""it's not even close.""</p><p>Here's what Starr actually said: ""The evidence, whether it's circumstantial or direct -- and I think it's virtually entirely circumstantial -- has to be overwhelming; not just beyond a reasonable doubt, overwhelming to the American people who aren't sitting in a courtroom and listening to every witness testify and drawing inferences and so forth. When you read the abuse of power article in the Nixon impeachment, a fair-minded person looks at that, reads it, hears it and says he had got to go. That's just not the case here.""</p><p>A Doug Collins quote</p><p>""'They just wanted to get at the President. They had no intention of having a proper investigation. They couldn't find any crimes so they did a vague abuse of power and abuse of Congress, which every administration from the beginning has done.' @RepDougCollins @foxandfriends"" -- December 18 tweet</p><p>Facts First: As the Washington Post and New York Times both noted, Trump misquoted Collins -- adding in significant words that Collins did not utter.</p><p>Collins didn't say that ""every administration from the beginning"" had committed ""abuse of power and abuse of Congress."" He said: ""So they said, 'At the end of the day, we can't form any crimes. We're going to do a vague abuse of power. And while we're at it, let's just throw in abuse of -- obstruction of Congress, because we didn't get our way.'""</p><p>Environment, energy and regulation</p><p>Dishwashers</p><p>Trump compared modern dishwashers unfavorably to older dishwashers, saying he was proposing to change federal regulations. He said that, in the past, ""you press it, boom,"" and the dishwasher cycle would run and be finished in five minutes; ""now, you press it 12 times. Women tell me."" He added, ""By the way, by the time they press it 10 times, you spend more on water and electric. Don't forget. The whole thing is worse because you're spending all that money on electric."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: Trump's claims were comprehensively inaccurate. Energy-efficient modern dishwashers do not require people to press buttons 10 times or 12 times to start them. More importantly, those modern dishwashers use less water and electricity than older dishwashers, not more.</p><p>The federal government's website for the Energy Star energy efficiency program notes that Energy Star-certified dishwashers cut people's electricity bills and save water: ""A new ENERGY STAR certified dishwasher will save, on average, 3,870 gallons of water over its lifetime."" Consumer Reports wrote in October: ""Today's dishwashers use about half the water and energy that dishwashers used 20 years ago. Thanks to tougher federal efficiency standards, water usage is down to about 4 to 6 gallons per load -- and less water means less energy required to heat the water.""</p><p>It is possible that Trump was confused. Some conservative and industry groups have made a push to get the government to roll back efficiency standards for dishwashers. They argue that modern dishwashers take too long to finish. Trump might have thought that the longer run times mean more water and electricity use, but that is not true.</p><p>The disposal of fluorescent light bulbs in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>""When a light bulb is out, you've got to bring it to a dump. So let's say over here in Battle Creek, where's your nearest dump?"" [Trump appears to hear a response from a member of the crowd.] ""OK, that's what, a couple of hundred miles away. So every time you lose, drive a couple of hundred miles."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: It is not true that people in Battle Creek, Michigan need to drive ""a couple of hundred miles"" to dispose of fluorescent light bulbs. A spokesperson for the city of Battle Creek, Jessica VanderKolk, said there are two collection events per year in Battle Creek itself where people can turn in such bulbs, plus two more collection events per year in the county seat about 11 miles away.</p><p>In addition, major store chains, such as Home Depot and Lowe's, allow people to drop off fluorescent bulbs there for free recycling. (We confirmed with the Home Depot and Lowe's stores in the Battle Creek area that people can do so at those locations.)</p><p>An environmental ""fine"" to San Francisco or Los Angeles</p><p>Alleging environmental violations related to San Francisco's population of homeless people and people who inject drugs, Trump said, ""And we fined San Francisco -- and Los Angeles and San Francisco. But we've just sent them a tremendous dollar fine for what they're doing."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: There is no evidence that either San Francisco or Los Angeles has been fined. Trump's Environmental Protection Agency sent San Francisco a ""notice of violation"" in October, but that notice merely mentioned the potential for fines in the future. Will Reisman, spokesperson for the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, the entity to which the EPA notice was sent, told CNN, ""We have not received any fines from the EPA."" The office of Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said Los Angeles had not been fined either.</p><p>The EPA would not respond directly when asked if Trump's claim was correct. A spokesman told CNN to ask the White House, saying in an email: ""...EPA has issued [a notice of violation] to San Francisco for failing to protect water quality. For details on the Presidents remarks, please reach out to the WH. EPA does not discuss ongoing enforcement actions."" The White House declined to comment.</p><p>Penalties for killing bald eagles</p><p>Complaining that ""windmills"" (his word for wind turbines) kill birds in California, Trump said that, by contrast, ""If you shoot a bald eagle, they want to put you in jail for 10 years."" -- December 21 speech to Turning Point USA Student Action Summit</p><p>Facts First: Penalties for shooting a bald eagle are much shorter than 10 years. It wasn't clear whether Trump was talking about federal law or California law, but he was wrong either way.</p><p>The relevant federal laws do not include penalties nearly that long for killing a bald eagle, the National Audubon Society, a nonprofit that works to protect birds, told the Toronto Star in May, when Trump made a ""five years"" version of this claim; the penalties are up to two years under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, if someone knowingly shoots a bald eagle with intent to sell or barter it, and up to two years under the Bald and Gold Eagle Protection Act, the National Audubon Society noted. (As the federal government's Fish and Wildlife Service notes on its website, the maximum two-year penalty under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act is for a second conviction; a first conviction has a maximum penalty of one year.)</p><p>Patrick Foy, a captain in the law enforcement division for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, sent CNN the relevant section from the state's Fish and Game Code, which sets out the maximum state penalty for killing a bald eagle at a fine of $5,000, imprisonment in a county jail for a year or less, or both.</p><p>Bird deaths</p><p>""A windmill will kill many bald eagles. It's true. And you know what? After a certain number, they make you turn the windmill off. That's true, by the way. "" -- December 21 speech to Turning Point USA Student Action Summit</p><p>Facts First: While wind turbine operators are exempted from penalties only for a certain number of eagle deaths the federal government agrees to authorize, they are not forced to shut down if they exceed that number.</p><p>Wind turbine operators, like other entities whose activities accidentally kill birds, can apply for a permit of up to 30 years to kill a specified number of eagles without facing punishment. But companies whose operations have killed an unauthorized number of eagles are not forced to close; they may be compelled by the federal government to pay fines, make changes to their operations or try to find ways to reduce their impact on birds.</p><p>""It's not necessarily true that somebody's going to walk in the door and shut it down,"" Joel Merriman, director of the Bird-Smart Wind Energy Campaign at the American Bird Conservancy, told CNN.</p><p>For example, in 2016, the Fish and Wildlife Service touted four civil settlements over the previous 18 months that resulted in commitments from wind companies to pay $55,000 in penalties and to spend a minimum of $1.86 million over three years ""on research and development of avian detection and deterrent technologies."" Duke Energy agreed in a 2013 plea agreement with the Justice Department to pay $1 million in fines to conservation groups and to come up with a plan to avoid bird deaths in the future.</p><p>Trump might perhaps have been thinking of the well-known saga of the company Altamont Winds, which announced in 2015 that it would shut down its turbines in California's Altamont Pass. The turbines had been the subject of numerous complaints from bird advocates, but the shutdown was the company's own decision.</p><p>Sen. Mazie Hirono and the Green New Deal</p><p>""How about the senator from Hawaii? Nasty...She wants the Green New Deal, and then they informed her that that does not include airplanes. And you're the senator from Hawaii. So they said, 'What are you going to do?' And then they talked about building a train to Hawaii, can you believe it? No, no, she wants it, even though you can't -- you'll never get to Hawaii again. Say goodbye to Hawaii. No, it's crazy, isn't it, though?"" -- December 21 speech to Turning Point USA Student Action Summit</p><p>Facts First: It is not true that Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono decided to support the Green New Deal and then was informed afterward that the deal ""does not include airplanes,"" nor that she later started talking about building a train to Hawaii. Trump was mischaracterizing an exchange Hirono had with a reporter in February.</p><p>Here is what actually happened. When told by a reporter that the Green New Deal would try to eliminate air travel and move to high-speed rail across the country, Hirono said that would be ""pretty hard for Hawaii,"" then laughed. She did not explain her laughter at that moment, but as she explained later, the Green New Deal resolution Hirono had endorsed does not actually call for the elimination of air travel.</p><p>Rather, the resolution calls for ""overhauling transportation systems in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible, including through investment in zero-emission vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing; clean, affordable, and accessible public transit; and high-speed rail."" That is not a call to completely eliminate air travel.</p><p>So where did the reporter get his premise? Possibly from a controversial ""FAQ"" page posted by a leading Green New Deal proponent, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, which had urged the government to ""build out high-speed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary."" But other Democrats did not endorse the FAQ, just the official resolution, and Ocasio-Cortez's office quickly deleted it.</p><p>When Trump made a similar claim about Hirono, the Green New Deal and air travel in February, Hirono told HawaiiNewsNow: ""As usual, climate change denier Donald Trump makes things up and doesn't know what he's talking about. While the Green New Deal is an ambitious plan to combat climate change, it does not call for the elimination of air travel. I will continue to fight against this president's lies.""</p><p>Democrats and factories</p><p>""And what they want to do is they want to get rid of all petroleum product. That means you basically won't have any factories in the United States."" -- December 21 speech to Turning Point USA Student Action Summit</p><p>Facts First: It is true that some prominent Democratic candidates want the US to end the use of fossil fuels over time, but achieving an end to American petroleum use would not mean there would be no American factories.</p><p>Joshua Busby, an associate professor of public affairs at the University of Texas who studies energy and environmental policy, noted that manufacturers who simply require electricity to power their factories could get that electricity from renewable sources. ""Solar and wind are cost competitive across much of the United States with natural gas, and the lowest cost option in a number of locations,"" Busby said. And he noted that most US petroleum use is in transportation -- motor gasoline alone made up 46% of US petroleum use in 2018, according to the federal government -- not in industrial production; the use of vehicles that run without using petroleum could be greatly expanded. Some heavy industries ""will be difficult sectors to fully decarbonize and move to 100% renewables, but nobody is proposing to do that overnight,"" Busby said.</p><p>Accomplishments</p><p>Judicial appointments</p><p>""187 new Federal Judges have been confirmed under the Trump Administration, including two great new United States Supreme Court Justices. We are shattering every record!"" -- December 24 tweet</p><p>Facts First: Trump has set at least one important record on judicial appointments -- he has appointed more appeals court judges than any other president at this point in a term -- but not ""every record."" Notably, the statistic he cited in this tweet, 187 total judges confirmed, is not a record, according to Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks judicial appointments.</p><p>President Jimmy Carter had appointed 197 people to federal courts by December 20 of his third year in office, Wheeler said. If you go by the percentage of the judiciary appointed, both Carter (29%) and President Richard Nixon (31%) had Trump (21%) beat, according to data Wheeler provided to CNN.</p><p>Trump had appointed 50 people to the federal appeals courts as of December 20, according to Wheeler's data and recent news reports. Carter had appointed 48 by the same point of his own presidency.</p><p>Merry Christmas</p><p>""And did you notice that everybody is saying Merry Christmas again? Did you notice? Saying Merry Christmas."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>""And let me begin by wishing you a beautiful -- look, do you remember this? Do you remember they were trying to take 'Christmas' out of Christmas? Do you remember? They didn't want to let you say 'Merry Christmas.' You would go around, you'd see department stores that have everything -- red, snow, beautiful ribbons, bows. Everything was there, but they wouldn't say 'Merry Christmas.' They're all saying 'Merry Christmas' again. You remember? I went through that, during the campaign: 'They going to say Merry Christmas again.' And they are."" -- December 21 speech to Turning Point USA Student Action Summit</p><p>Facts First: There is no evidence that people are now saying ""Merry Christmas"" any more frequently than they did under previous presidents, nor that all stores that declined to use the phrase before Trump's presidency have changed their policies.</p><p>It's hard to measure this stuff, but one metric is the socially conservative American Family Association's annual list of retailers that it considers ""naughty"" or ""nice"" when it comes to its willingness to use the word ""Christmas"" in promotional materials. Not one of the 17 ""naughty"" companies the AFA listed in a press release in December 2015, the year Trump launched his presidential campaign, had been promoted to ""nice"" on the 2019 list, though two had moved from ""naughty"" to ""marginal.""</p><p>Military airplanes</p><p>""So we spent a lot of money on brand-new airplanes, as you know. We were -- three years ago, you didn't have brand-new airplanes. You were not doing well. And now you have all brand new."" -- December 24 teleconference with members of the military</p><p>Facts First: This was a major exaggeration. While Trump's administration has invested in new military planes, it is not even close to true that the planes currently in use are ""all brand new.""</p><p>In December 2018, the Congressional Budget Office reported that the average Air Force plane in 2017 was 28.3 years old: ""They range widely in age from the 75 new aircraft that entered service in 2017 to the 21 60-year-old KC-135 tankers that entered service in 1958. The largest share of the fleet is 26--30 years old."" The average age for fighter and attack planes was 26.4 years, for bombers 42.0 years, for tankers 53.7 years.</p><p>In addition, ""The military was buying new aircraft all throughout the Obama administration, like the F-35,"" said Todd Harrison, director of the Aerospace Security Project and director of Defense Budget Analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank.</p><p>Roger Stone's involvement in the Trump campaign</p><p>""You know, Roger Stone was not involved in my campaign in any way -- other than the very, very beginning, before I -- I think, I -- long before I announced -- a little bit."" And: ""And again, Roger Stone was not a part of it -- the campaign. He was somebody I've known over the years, but not a part of the campaign. Very, very, very early on -- long before I -- I think long before I even announced, he was involved in a minor way."" -- December 24 exchange with reporters after teleconference with members of the military</p><p>Facts First: Stone was involved in Trump's campaign after Trump announced his candidacy, not merely before. Trump announced his run in June 2015; Stone either resigned or was fired -- there is a dispute about what happened -- in August 2015, more than a month and a half into the campaign.</p><p>Prosecutors at Stone's trial this year -- which resulted in his conviction on charges of lying to Congress, witness tampering and obstructing a congressional committee proceeding -- introduced as evidence phone records that suggested Stone and Trump also spoke in 2016, after Stone's official role with the campaign ended.</p><p>The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals</p><p>""...how about the Ninth Circuit? Do you know that, as of next week -- do you know that we're going to be even on the Ninth Circuit? This was a disaster. We put a lot of judges on the Ninth Circuit."" -- December 21 speech to Turning Point USA Student Action Summit</p><p>Facts First: While Trump has made 10 appointments to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, whose decisions he has previously complained about, it was not true at the time he spoke that the 29-member court was going to be ""even"" by ""next week"" between judges appointed by Republicans and Democrats (""Next week"" has now passed.) The margin at the time was 16 Democratic appointees to 13 Republican appointees, and there were no additional vacancies for Trump to fill.</p><p>""Although it is true that President Trump has 'put a lot of judges on the Ninth Circuit,' there is no chance that it will be tied by 'next week.' In fact, it probably won't be tied by next year,"" said Arthur Hellman, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law and an expert on the Ninth Circuit. ""To get a tie (or better), two Democratic appointees would have to retire. All nine of the active judges appointed by President Clinton are eligible to retire, but I doubt that any of them will do so before the November election. Unless Democratic appointees retire or leave the bench (or Congress adds new judgeships), there can't be a Republican majority or even a tie.""</p><p>The Commission on Presidential Debates</p><p>""...3 years ago they were forced to publicly apologize for modulating my microphone in the first debate against Crooked Hillary."" -- December 16 tweet</p><p>Facts First: The Commission on Presidential Debates did not publicly apologize for Trump's microphone issue at the first debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton three years ago. (It also did not acknowledge any deliberate manipulation of Trump's microphone.) It issued a one-line statement that said: ""Regarding the first debate, there were issues regarding Donald Trump's audio that affected the sound level in the debate hall.""</p><p>Here are the claims Trump made over these two weeks that we have previously fact checked in one of these weekly roundups:</p><p>Foreign and military affairs</p><p>The US share of NATO</p><p>Trump said the United States used to pay for ""100% of NATO."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: According to the most recent official NATO figures, released in November 2019, US military spending represented between about 71% and about 73% of NATO members' total military spending in 2014, 2015 and 2016. That is a hefty percentage, but ""100%"" is an exaggeration. (The US share of NATO military expenditures has declined to about 69% per year under Trump.)</p><p>Previous presidents and NATO</p><p>Trump said previous presidents had not demanded military spending increases from NATO members: ""President Obama would go down to make a speech. 'I'd like to thank everybody for being here, thanks a lot, great job, sayonara, bye.' Bush, they all did. Nobody ever asked for money."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: It's not true that Obama and Bush never asked NATO members to increase their military spending. Obama and Bush both did so, though their public language was less confrontational than Trump's has been.</p><p>Obama repeatedly urged NATO allies to spend more. ""If we've got a collective defense, it means that everybody's got to chip in, and I've had some concerns about a diminished level of defense spending among some of our partners in NATO,"" Obama said in 2014. ""The situation in Ukraine reminds us that our freedom isn't free and we've got to be willing to pay for the assets, the personnel, the training that's required to make sure that we have a credible NATO force and an effective deterrent force.""</p><p>At Bush's final NATO summit, in 2008, Bush called on NATO allies to ""increase their defense investments to support both NATO and EU operations.""</p><p>The Coast Guard and Hurricane Harvey</p><p>""You know, the Coast Guard, with the work they've done during hurricane season, two years ago, in Texas -- in particular, Texas -- because they saved 16,000 lives. Nobody understands what that means -- 16,000. Even me -- I heard that number, and I said, 'Can that be possible? Sixteen thousand.' They served 16,000 lives -- and saved."" -- December 24 teleconference with members of the military</p><p>Facts First: The Coast Guard says the correct number is 11,022 people rescued. (This was not a one-time slip; Trump has regularly said ""16,000."")</p><p>Military pay increases</p><p>""But this Christmas, I hope that every member of our military will feel the overwhelming love and gratitude of our nation for your faithful service. Starting January 1st, you'll be getting your largest pay raise in more than a decade."" And: ""...it will be largest in over a decade, and you very much earned it. -- December 24 teleconference with members of the military</p><p>Facts First: Trump was exaggerating slightly when he said the troops will get their largest increase in ""more than"" and ""over"" a decade. Both the 2019 pay increase of 2.6% and the planned 2020 increase of 3.1% are the largest since 2010, so nine years and 10 years ago respectively.</p><p>(We know this is a minor stretch, but Trump has relentlessly embellished accurate numbers by adding words like ""over"" and ""more than,"" so it's a pattern of little dishonesty rather than a one-time error.)</p><p>NATO spending increases</p><p>""Over the last period of just two years. I raised -- not from us, nothing from us -- $130 billion, but that's nothing. And over a short period of time, they will be paying $530 billion more, all of those countries."" And: ""They have to pay -- $530 billion and the fake news doesn't want to even talk about it. They don't want to talk about it.'"" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: Trump's math was wrong: the $130 billion current increase in military spending by non-US NATO members (over 2016 levels) cannot be added to the $400 billion increase expected by 2024; the $400 billion figure includes the $130 billion.</p><p>NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg explained during a meeting with Trump on December 3 that non-US NATO members have added a total of $130 billion to their defense budgets since 2016. By 2024, Stoltenberg said, ""this number will increase to $400 billion.""</p><p>The history of NATO spending</p><p>Trump said of military spending by NATO members before he took office: ""I'm telling you, if you look, it's like 15 years, just down."" He drew a downward-sloping line in the air with his hand. -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: Military spending by NATO members had increased for two years prior to Trump's presidency. According to the latest NATO figures, released in November, spending increased by 1.7% in 2015 and 3.0% in 2016.</p><p>Veterans Choice</p><p>Trump said three times that he was the one who got the Veterans Choice program passed. He said once that people had been trying to do so for ""44 years,"" twice that people had been trying for almost ""50 years.""</p><p>Facts First: The Choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by senators Bernie Sanders and the late John McCain, was signed into law by Barack Obama in 2014. In 2018, Trump signed the VA Mission Act, which expanded and changed the program.</p><p>Military spending</p><p>Trump said twice that the US military has spent $2.5 trillion during his presidency.</p><p>Facts First: Trump was exaggerating. Defense spending for fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019 was $2.05 trillion, and that includes more than three-and-a-half months of Obama's tenure, since the 2017 fiscal year began in October 2016.</p><p>Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said he thinks Trump must have been including military funding for the 2020 fiscal year to get to the ""$2.5 trillion"" figure -- but the 2020 fiscal year just started on October 1, and Harrison noted that the defense appropriation has not yet been approved by Congress.</p><p>Economy and trade</p><p>Chinese tariffs</p><p>""As you know, we're now getting along very well with China and trade. In fact, they just took tariffs off more than 800 products, where they were charging us tariffs. And now those tariffs are gone."" -- December 24 teleconference with members of the military</p><p>Facts First: ""Gone"" was an exaggeration. China announced the day prior that it will lower, not eliminate, tariffs on more than 850 US products starting on January 1.</p><p>Manufacturing jobs</p><p>""Well, we've got 600,000 manufacturing jobs and you're going to see a big, big increase."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: Trump was exaggerating. The economy added 497,000 manufacturing jobs between January 2017, when Trump took office, and November 2019, official data shows. The number is 524,000 jobs added if you go back to November 2016, the month of Trump's election, as Trump often likes to do.</p><p>Hillary Clinton and the trade agreement with South Korea</p><p>""...the people that made these trade deals, it's like, where did they come? Like the one in Korea, that was a Hillary Clinton special. She said this will produce 250,000 new jobs, and I said, well, what happened? He said, well, she was right except it was for South Korea, not for us. So it produced 250,000 jobs for South Korea."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: There is no record of Hillary Clinton projecting an increase of 250,000 jobs because of the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS). President Barack Obama said the deal would ""support at least 70,000 American jobs.""</p><p>Obama said in 2009 that increasing the US share of trade with Asia from 9% to 10% ""could mean 250,000, 300,000 jobs,"" but he was not specifically attributing that estimate to the potential effects of a trade deal with South Korea. Republican Rep. Kevin Brady later used an estimate of ""about 250,000 new jobs"" from trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama combined, not just the one with South Korea.</p><p>Pelosi and USMCA</p><p>""The great USMCA Trade Deal (Mexico &amp; Canada) has been sitting on Nancy Pelosi's desk for 8 months, she doesn't even know what it says, &amp; today, after passing by a wide margin in the House, Pelosi tried to take credit for it..."" -- December 19 tweet</p><p>Facts First: The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement was not been sitting on Pelosi's desk for ""8 months"" before she agreed in December to have the Democrat-controlled House to pass it. Though the Trump administration had pushed Pelosi to persuade the House to quickly pass the agreement, it had not sent her any implementing legislation.</p><p>In fact, the President's trade team chose to negotiate with her to address the concerns of Democrats rather than immediately sending her a bill to which some of her party's caucus might have had significant objections.</p><p>Household income gains</p><p>""Total income gains for median households will reach $10,000 a family. I'll give you a couple of quick numbers. So under President Bush, for eight years, you saved $450, meaning you took in $450. OK, fine. Under President Obama, you took in $975. Under President Trump, including the energy savings and the regulation savings and the tax cuts savings, it's more than $10,000 in less than three years. Pretty good, right? So for two eight years, you had a $400, $450 and a $975. That's eight years, $450. In less than three years, you had more than $10,000. That goes right into your pockets."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: We can't fact check Trump's prediction that household income gains under him ""will"" reach $10,000 a family, but his claim that the number has already hit $10,000 in less than three years is inaccurate. A firm called Sentier Research has found pre-tax income gains of more than $5,00 between January 2017 and October 2019, but any gains from cuts to regulations or in reductions in energy prices would be included in this amount, not added on top of it. Also, it is entirely unclear what Trump is referring to when he talks about ""energy savings""; household energy costs have increased since Trump took office, as have gasoline costs. (Gasoline costs are lower than they were for most of Obama's presidency, but higher than they were in 2016.)</p><p>You can read a longer fact check here.</p><p>Japanese automakers and Michigan</p><p>""But Michigan's had the best year it's ever had. Best year it's ever had. And that's because we have auto companies expanding and thriving and they're coming in from Japan and they're coming in from a lot of other places."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: Japanese automakers have announced just two new US plants during Trump's presidency, and neither is to be built in Michigan.</p><p>Toyota and Mazda announced a joint venture in 2018 to build a plant in Alabama. Kristin Dziczek, vice president for industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research, said in November there had been only one other Japanese announcement of a new auto plant under Trump: Hino Motors' 2017 decision to move its West Virginia truck assembly operations to a bigger West Virginia location.</p><p>Prescription drug prices</p><p>""Our drug price is down for the first time in 51 years, drug prices came down..."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: Trump was exaggerating. The Consumer Price Index for prescription drugs showed a 0.6% decline between December 2017 and December 2018, which was the first calendar-year decline since 1972 -- the first decline in 46 years, not the first one in ""more than 50 years."" (As the Washington Post pointed out in its own fact check, some experts say the Consumer Price Index is a flawed measure of trends in drug prices, since it doesn't include rebates that drug companies pay to insurers. The IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science, which studies drug prices, found that ""net drug prices in the United States increased at an estimated 1.5% in 2018.</p><p>Obama and manufacturing</p><p>""Remember the statement by President Obama, 'You'd have to wave a magic wand.' Remember, the magic wand, because manufacturing. And I said, you know, that sounds strange. What do you do if you don't have manufacturing? How do you make things, right? 'Manufacturing jobs won't happen.'"" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: Trump's ""magic wand"" comment was a reference to a remark President Barack Obama made at a PBS town hall in 2016 -- but he was inaccurately describing what Obama said. Obama scoffed at Trump's promises to bring back what Obama called ""jobs of the past"" without providing specifics on how he would do so. Contrary to Trump's claims, though, Obama didn't say manufacturing was dead or that new manufacturing jobs could not be created; Obama boasted of how many manufacturing jobs were being created during his presidency, saying, ""We actually make more stuff, have a bigger manufacturing base today than we've had in most of our history.""</p><p>November jobs estimates</p><p>Trump boasted of the 266,000 jobs added in November, then said, ""And you know they said -- if you're a business watcher, which I am. I love watching business, but they said they were guessing: could be 70,000, could be 80,000, maybe 90, maybe 110, somebody said."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: While the number of jobs added by the US economy in November, 266,000, did exceed analysts' expectations, those expectations were much higher than Trump claimed. The median estimate from economists surveyed by Reuters was 180,000 jobs added -- and the lowest of the economists' estimates was 120,000 jobs added.</p><p>Trump did not specify who he was talking about when he repeatedly referred to an unnamed ""they"" and ""somebody""; it is certainly plausible that somebody somewhere thought that a mere 70,000, 80,000 or 90,000 jobs would be added. (His last number, 110,000, wasn't too far off from reality.) But Trump created the impression that he was talking about the expectations of economic experts.</p><p>Unemployment for women</p><p>Trump said twice that the unemployment rate for women was the best or lowest in ""71 years.""</p><p>Facts First: It had been 66 years, not 71 years, since the women's unemployment rate has been as low as it was in November, 3.5%. (That's if you ignore the 3.4% in September and April.)</p><p>Energy production</p><p>Trump said three times that he had ""ended the war on American energy,"" and ""the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas."" On a third occasion, he touted ""becoming the world's top energy producer"" as one of his accomplishments in office.</p><p>Facts First: The US has not just ""now"" become the world's top energy producer: it took the top spot in 2012, according to the US government's Energy Information Administration -- under the very Obama administration Trump is accusing of perpetrating a ""war"" on the industry.</p><p>The US became the top producer of crude oil in particular during Trump's tenure. ""The United States has been the world's top producer of natural gas since 2009, when US natural gas production surpassed that of Russia, and it has been the world's top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013, when its production exceeded Saudi Arabia's,"" the Energy Information Administration says.</p><p>Revenue from tariffs on China</p><p>""And you know, China's paying us billions and billions of dollars a year. They never gave us 10 cents."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: Americans make the actual tariff payments, and a bevy of economic studies, including a report in late November from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, have found that Americans are bearing the overwhelming majority of the tariff costs, Aside from the question of who is paying, it's not true that the Treasury has never received ""10 cents"" from tariffs on China. The US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries; FactCheck.org reported that the US generated an ""average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.""</p><p>Trump's claim also ignores China's hundreds of billions of dollars in purchases of US goods -- more than $300 billion during Trump's presidency alone.</p><p>The Mueller investigation</p><p>""Dirty cops"" at the FBI</p><p>Trump referred four times to former FBI director James Comey as a ""dirty cop.""</p><p>Facts First: We give Trump wide latitude to express opinions about public figures, but the December report from Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz presented no evidence that Comey was corrupt in any way. Horowitz found significant errors in FBI work connected to the Russia investigation, and rejected Comey's claim of vindication, but he did not make any finding accusing Comey of deliberate malfeasance.</p><p>The cost of the Mueller investigation</p><p>""After three years of unfair and unwarranted investigations, 45 million dollars spent..."" -- December 17 anti-impeachment letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</p><p>""...but think of this, $45 million they spent..."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: The Mueller investigation Trump keeps saying cost ""$45 million"" actually cost $32 million, according to figures released by the Justice Department, and the government is expected to recoup about $17 million as a result of the investigation, most from former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, according to a CNN analysis of the sentences handed out to people charged by Mueller.</p><p>Ukraine and impeachment</p><p>What Biden said ""looked bad""</p><p>""Biden openly stated: 'I said, ""I'm telling you, you're not getting the billion dollars""... I looked at them and said: ""I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money."" Well, son of a bitch. He got fired.'"" Even Joe Biden admitted just days ago in an interview with NPR that it 'looked bad.'"" -- December 17 anti-impeachment letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</p><p>Facts First: Trump was not entirely clear on what he meant by ""it,"" but he left the impression that Biden had recently told NPR that his effort to oust Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, or the 2018 video of him telling the story of his effort to oust Shokin, ""looked bad."" In fact, Biden's ""looked bad"" comment was about something different: Hunter Biden's position on the board. Specifically, Biden said ""the appearance"" of Hunter Biden's presence on the board ""looked bad and it gave folks like Rudy Giuliani an excuse to come up with a Trumpian kind of defense.""</p><p>What Zelensky said</p><p>""President Zelensky has repeatedly declared that I did nothing wrong, and that there was No Pressure. He further emphasized that it was a 'good phone call,' that 'I don't feel pressure,' and explicitly stressed that 'nobody pushed me.'"" -- December 17 anti-impeachment letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</p><p>Facts First: Zelensky did say there had been ""no pressure"" from Trump and made other statements to that effect, but he has not gone so far as to say Trump did nothing wrong.</p><p>In an interview published by Time magazine in early December, Zelensky did say, ""Look, I never talked to the President from the position of a quid pro quo. That's not my thing."" But Zelensky continued: ""I don't want us to look like beggars. But you have to understand. We're at war. If you're our strategic partner, then you can't go blocking anything for us. I think that's just about fairness. It's not about a quid pro quo. It just goes without saying.""</p><p>The accuracy of the whistleblower</p><p>Trump criticized ""the so-called whistleblower who started this entire hoax with a false report of the phone call that bears no relationship to the actual phone call that was made."" -- December 17 anti-impeachment letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</p><p>Facts First: The whistleblower's account of Trump's July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been proven highly accurate. In fact, the rough transcript released by Trump himself showed that the whistleblower's three primary allegations about the call were correct or very close to correct. You can read a full fact check here.</p><p>The whistleblowers having ""disappeared""</p><p>""Once I presented the transcribed call, which surprised and shocked the fraudsters (they never thought that such evidence would be presented), the so-called whistleblower, and the second whistleblower, disappeared because they got caught, their report was a fraud, and they were no longer going to be made available to us."" -- December 17 anti-impeachment letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</p><p>Facts First: There is no evidence that either the first whistleblower (who filed the complaint about Trump's dealings with Ukraine) or the second whistleblower (whose lawyers said they had firsthand information corroborating claims made by the first whistleblower) are now somehow ""gone,"" let alone that they are ""gone"" because the first whistleblower was shown to be inaccurate.</p><p>""The whistleblowers have not vanished,"" Bradley Moss, a colleague of Mark Zaid, a lawyer for the two whistleblowers, said on Twitter in October, when Trump made another version of this claim.</p><p>The first whistleblower's lawyers, Zaid and Andrew Bakaj, wrote in the Washington Post in October: ""Because our client has no additional information about the president's call, there is no justification for exposing their identity and all the risks that would follow.""</p><p>The existence of the second whistleblower -- who never planned to file a separate whistleblower complaint -- was revealed after Trump released the rough transcript of his call with Zelensky, not before.</p><p>The Salem Witch Trials</p><p>""More due process was afforded to those accused in the Salem Witch Trials."" -- December 17 anti-impeachment letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</p><p>Facts First: Trump might have meant this as a non-literal figure of speech, but as a factual matter, the claim is absurd. (Salem's current mayor told Trump to ""learn some history."") Nineteen innocent people were hanged after they were accused of witchcraft in the trials of the late 1600s. The courts accepted ""spectral evidence"" from dreams. Some of the accused were tortured into confessions.</p><p>The rough transcript</p><p>""Fortunately, there was a transcript of the conversation taken, and you know from the transcript (which was immediately made available) that the paragraph in question was perfect."" -- December 17 anti-impeachment letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</p><p>Facts First: The call occurred in July. Trump released the rough transcript in September, after the public learned of the existence of the whistleblower complaint about the call and after a series of news reports that raised questions about the call. (The Washington Post reported at the time: ""Trump's decision to release the transcript follows nearly a week of speculation around what he specifically asked for during a call that an intelligence official found so problematic he filed an official complaint."")</p><p>Immigration</p><p>Mexican soldiers and the border</p><p>""And, as you know, we have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our border right now protecting our border."" -- December 17 remarks at meeting with Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales</p><p>Facts First: Mexico has deployed around 27,000 troops, but Trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the US border in particular. CNN reported on November 2: ""Nearly 15,000 troops are deployed to Mexico's northern border, where they've set up 20 checkpoints, Mexican Defense Minister Luis Cresencio Sandoval said last week at a press briefing on the country's security strategy. At the southern border, 12,000 troops are deployed and have set up 21 checkpoints.""</p><p>Acting US Customs and Border Protection commissioner Mark Morgan has offered similar numbers, telling reporters in September that 10,000 of approximately 25,000 troops were on Mexico's southern border.</p><p>Deportations to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador</p><p>""One of the big things that's happened with Guatemala -- and Honduras, El Salvador, and some others -- is that, in past administrations, they and others would not take people back. So if we had very dangerous people in our country and they came from Guatemala, or another country that we now have agreements with -- we never had agreements with anybody -- they just wouldn't take them back. But now they have to take them back, and they take them back with open arms."" -- December 17 remarks at meeting with Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales</p><p>""And we have agreements now with Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador -- you know they didn't use to take them back. If we had a murderer and we said 'get them the hell out, you know, we don't really want them in our prisons and take care of them for 50, 60 years. We want to bring them back,' they wouldn't take them. The planes used to go around and around -- 'Don't land, don't land.' With us, they land. We worked at deals with every one of them. We stop giving them all the aid. You know we're giving them all this money and then they said, 'We're not going to let you land, we're not going to let you take them back.'"" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: Trump was mixing up two separate issues. While the Trump administration does have new agreements with all three of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, those agreements are related to the handling of people who come to the US seeking asylum, not criminals the US is seeking to deport. In 2016, just prior to Trump's presidency, none of the three countries was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered ""recalcitrant"" (uncooperative) in accepting the return of their citizens from the US.</p><p>You can read a longer fact check in this article.</p><p>Democrats and borders, part 1</p><p>Trump said twice that Democrats support a policy of ""open borders."" On a third occasion, he made this accusation specifically about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.</p><p>Facts First: Even 2020 Democratic presidential candidates who advocate the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary JuliÃ¡n Castro, do not support completely unrestricted migration, as Trump suggests.</p><p>While Pelosi wants a more liberal immigration policy than Trump does, she has repeatedly endorsed funding for border security measures aside from the President's proposed wall.</p><p>Democrats and borders, part 2</p><p>""The Democrat Party is trying to shred our Constitution, tear down our history, erase the nation's borders. They don't want to have any borders."" -- December 21 speech to Turning Point USA Student Action Summit</p><p>Facts First: This claim is baseless. The Democratic Party is not trying to eliminate borders.</p><p>Accomplishments</p><p>The Electoral College result in 2016</p><p>""Your chosen candidate lost the election in 2016, in an Electoral College landslide (306-227), and you and your party have never recovered from this defeat."" -- December 17 anti-impeachment letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</p><p>Facts First: Leaving aside Trump's characterization of the result as a ""landslide,"" he got the numbers wrong -- again. If he was going by the number of electoral votes each candidate earned in the voting, the result was 306 for him to 232 for Clinton. If he was going by the final result, after some ""faithless electors"" defected from both him and Clinton, the result was 304 for him to 227 for Clinton. This was not a one-time slip; Trump is habitually inaccurate about this.</p><p>Right to Try</p><p>Trump said that people have been trying to get a national Right to Try law passed for 49 years: ""They've been trying to do it for 49 years."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: There had not been a 49-year push to get such a law passed before Trump signed it in May 2018. (The law aims to make it easier for terminally ill patients to access medications that have not been granted final approval.) Similar laws have been passed at the state level only since 2014, after the Goldwater Institute, a libertarian think tank, began pushing for them.</p><p>""I have no idea what 'they've been trying to get' for 44 years,"" Alison Bateman-House, assistant professor of medical ethics at New York University's Langone Health, said in response to a previous version of Trump's claim. ""The Right to Try law was a creation of the Goldwater Institute, and it first became state law in 2014 (in Colorado), relatively soon after it was first conceived of.</p><p>Michigan's ""Man of the Year""</p><p>Trump said twice that he was named ""Man of the Year"" in Michigan about 10 years ago.</p><p>Facts First: CNN and other news outlets have found no evidence Trump was ever named Michigan's man of the year. You can read our full fact check on this claim here.</p><p>Trump's crowds</p><p>On separate occasions, Trump said that ""I've never had an empty seat"" and that ""I don't think we've ever had an empty seat from the time I came down the escalator.""</p><p>Facts First: There have been empty seats at various Trump rallies, including an October rally Minneapolis, a July rally in Greenville, North Carolina, an October 2018 rally in Houston and an April 2017 rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, according to journalists on the scene.</p><p>The media</p><p>Newspapers' election polls</p><p>""The problem is the newspaper polls are more fake than the news they write. They write fake polls. It's true. They write fake polls. You call them suppression polls. You read them and you get depressed because it looks like you're doing badly. They do that. I think it's almost worse than what they write, and you can't get much worse than what they write."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>Facts First: There is simply no evidence that newspaper pollsters have manipulated their numbers to suppress the enthusiasm of Trump voters, as Trump has repeatedly alleged.</p><p>A CNN camera</p><p>Trump praised Fox News host Laura Ingraham, then said, ""You know, now the CNN -- the CNN cameras -- all the cameras just turned off. That's okay. They don't want to promote Laura."" -- December 21 speech to Turning Point USA Student Action Summit</p><p>Facts First: CNN did not turn off its camera as Trump promoted Ingraham; it was serving as the ""pool"" camera feeding the speech to various networks. And CNN did not stop broadcasting Trump's speech; CNN was not even airing the speech live on television. (Also, CNN's photojournalists at Trump events have the ""tally"" lights on their cameras set permanently to off, so Trump would have no way of seeing from the stage even if they did ever turn a camera off.) Trump has repeatedly made versions of this false claim.</p><p>Judges</p><p>Obama's judicial vacancies</p><p>Trumps said twice that President Barack Obama left him ""142"" judicial vacancies.</p><p>Facts First: Trump exaggerated. According to Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks judicial appointments, there were 103 vacancies on district and appeals courts on Jan. 1, 2017, just before Trump took office, plus a vacancy on the Supreme Court.</p><p>For database:</p><p>The history of judicial vacancies</p><p>Mocking Obama for supposedly leaving him ""142"" judicial vacancies -- we explained in the item above that this figure is inaccurate -- Trump said, ""I mean, normally, when you leave office, you leave none. You leave none."" -- December 21 speech to Turning Point USA Student Action Summit</p><p>Facts First: It's not true that outgoing presidents usually leave no judicial vacancies to their successors. According to Wheeler, there were 53 vacancies on January 1, 2009, just before Obama took office; 80 vacancies on January 1, 2001, just before George W. Bush took office; 107 vacancies on January 1, 1993, just before Bill Clinton took office.</p><p>So Trump had the most judges to appoint since Clinton, but, clearly, other presidents also had appointing to do.</p><p>Pre-existing conditions</p><p>""Republicans will strongly protect patients with pre-existing conditions."" -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan</p><p>""We take care of pre-existing conditions. They're not going to be able to do that. -- December 19 remarks at meeting with Rep. Jeff Van Drew</p><p>Facts First: Democrats already did ""take care of"" pre-existing conditions: they created protections for people with such conditions in the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, the law they passed in 2010 over Republican opposition.</p><p>The Trump administration and congressional Republicans have repeatedly put forward bills and filed lawsuits that would weaken Obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Trump is currently supporting a Republican lawsuit that is seeking to declare all of Obamacare void. He has not issued a plan to reinstate the law's protections for people with pre-existing conditions if the suit succeeds.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=""http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/""><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""DOC-ID"">CNNCOM-20200101trump-90-false-claims-final-two-weeks-20191</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""royaltyReportingKey"">CNNCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""PGUID"">urn:contentItem:5XX3-S071-DY60-M3NK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""productContentSetIdentifier"">266325</dc:source><dc:date dateType=""last-updated"">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=""12216""/><timeReceived>7:35 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNN.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=""object-key""/><keyValue value=""15303""/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=""object-type"" value=""201""/><parameter name=""object-smi"" value=""LOGOS""/><parameter name=""componentseq"" value=""1""/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=""01"" month=""01"" year=""2020""><dateText>January 1, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=""publicationtype""><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=""publicationtype""><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=""language""><classificationItem classificationScheme=""lang.english""><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=""licensor.indexing-terms""><classification classificationScheme=""licensor.subject""><classificationItem><className>trump-90-false-claims-final-two-weeks-2019</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=""indexing-terms""><classification classificationScheme=""legal""><classificationItem score=""50""><className>Business &amp;

A magistrate judge ruled Friday[4] that there was enough evidence to keep five out of six men charged federally with the kidnapping plot behind bars; the sixth man, Barry Croft Jr., was arrested in New Jersey[5] but has not yet appeared in court in Michigan. Eight more men face state terrorism charges[6].Scoping Out The Governor's HouseWhile it's sometimes difficult for prosecutors to prove the intent behind alleged criminal conspiracies, such as in the kidnapping plot case in Michigan, the group's willingness to be photographed and filmed — includingby an undercover informant[7]—certainly doesn't hurt the government's case. That's perhaps most evident in photos of the men casing Whitmer's house. </p><p>One picture released by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Michigan shows an alleged plotter using binoculars to peer across a lake at Whitmer's vacation home. Authorities say the men discussed escaping with Whitmer by boat and even mulled leaving her in the middle of Lake Michigan[8].U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Michigan Drive-By PhotographyThe men also allegedly documented themselves driving right by the governor's house on two separate occasions, taking photos as they went. As an FBI agent's affidavit[9] notes, the group allegedly performed the first of two drive-by stake outs of Whitmer's vacation home on Aug. 29 — when they allegedly 'took photographs and slow-motion video from their vehicle as they drove by it, and discussed conducting additional surveillance from the water at a later date.' Those photos and videos ended up in the group's encrypted messaging channel[10] — which are usually pretty secure, unless they've been infiltrated by a federal informant.U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Michigan U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Michigan Emojis And GIFs Still CountProsecutors allege that the men relied at times on coded language — such as referring to explosives as 'cupcakes' — but text message conversations released by prosecutors show a new level of buffoonery. In one instance, in a group chat[11] that involved an FBI source, the alleged conspirators used emojis and .gifs from 'Borat' and 'Inglorious Basterds' to illustrate their excitement at stalking the governor and, potentially, blowing up a bridge in order to slow police response.U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Michigan U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Michigan U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Michigan Cartographic Paper TrailDefendant Adam Fox, prosecutors allege, even hand-drew a map of Whitmer's vacation home that included estimated police response times. The FBI's source allegedly captured a picture of what the government says is Fox drawing that map, as well as the map itself.U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of MichiganVacuum Shop ShenanigansFox, the alleged ringleader of the kidnapping plot, lived for much of the past year in the basement of a vacuum cleaner repair shop, sharing the space with his two dogs and plenty of spare vacuum parts. The store's owner, Briant Titus, told TPM Wednesday[12] that Fox kept the alleged plot hidden from him — 'because he knew he'd be homeless' otherwise. But Fox appears to have filmed footage of himself training in that same shop basement. [embedded content] Training Videos From A PT CruiserPlenty of armed groups take part in training exercises, often involving target practice, medic training and the like.But the jabronis accused of plotting the governor's kidnapping managed to make even this look ridiculous, given their alleged choice of vehicle: A gosh darn PT Cruiser[13].BREAKING: Today @FOX17[14] obtained new FBI docs in an alleged plot to kidnap Michigan @GovWhitmer[15] - the docs lay out tactical training, surveillance, and violent threats against lawmakers and police officers.. pic.twitter .com/kYNkf0F5pK[16]; — Doug

US officials were even having meetings discussing possible assassination of the man who exposed so many secrets of American military and clandestine actions abroad. <br/> Dozens of US intelligence officials, including many who had served under the Trump administration, are now confirming the CIA considered 'options' for kidnapping and/or assassinating Assange and that plans were mulled over at the highest levels of CIA leadership. 'More than 30 former U.S. officials — eight of whom described details of the CIA's proposals to abduct Assange,' are sourced in the report, which further reveals the CIA targeted journalists who worked closely with WikiLeaks, including Glenn Greenwald. <br/>[60] <br/><br/><br/> Court Strikes Down Bans on Mask Mandates, Critical Race Theory and More[61] <br/> A Maricopa County judge struck down a ban on public schools imposing face mask mandates and a host of other policy changes that lawmakers inserted into the state budget, and with them, may have forced a fundamental change in the way the legislature does business when it passes its annual budget each year. <br/> The ruling comes two days before the mask mandate prohibition and various other changes to state law were to go into effect. <br/> Along with the ban on face mask mandates, the ruling strikes down several other laws pertaining to COVID-19 mitigation measures and the operation of public schools. That includes laws banning 'critical race theory' in K-12 schools, barring colleges and universities from requiring COVID-19 vaccinations or testing of students, prohibiting K-12 schools from requiring students to receive vaccines that have received emergency authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and barring cities and counties from requiring 'vaccine passports.' <br/>[62] <br/><br/><br/> Despite Over 95% Vaxx'd, Harvard Business School Shifts Classes Online After 'Substantial Outbreak' Of COVID[63] <br/> Is Zero-COVID come to the Ivy League? <br/> Poets&amp;#38;Quants has learned that Harvard Business School (HBS) has moved its first-year and some second-year MBA students to remote learning after an outbreak of COVID. <br/> 'In recent days, we've seen a steady rise in breakthrough infections among our student population, despite high vaccination rates and frequent testing,' Mark Cautela, head of communications for HBS, told Poets&amp;#38;Quants. <br/> 'Contact tracers which have worked with positive cases highlight that transmission is not occurring in classrooms or other academic settings on campus. Nor is it occurring among masked individuals.' <br/>[64] <br/><br/><br/> Dozens Protest Vaccine Mandate at P&amp;#38;G in Cape Girardeau Co.[65] <br/>CAPE GIRARDEAU COUNTY, Mo. (KFVS) — Dozens of people were in Fruitland on Monday morning to protest new COVID-19 vaccine rules at Procter &amp;#38; Gamble. <br/> In an email recently sent to employees, the company announced it will require workers to be fully vaccinated, get a company-approved exemption or undergo weekly testing for the coronavirus. <br/> We're told people at Monday's protest are a mix of P&amp;#38;G employees as well as family and friends. <br/>[66] <br/><br/><br/> Enrollment Drops at Seattle Public School That Houses Violent Homeless Encampment[67] <br/> Principal Tipton Blish of the Broadview— Thompson K-8 public school in Seattle admitted in an email that classrooms will need to be reorganized to due to plummeting enrollment.

Gaetz and Greene have been adamant that those who are being held on charges stemming from that January day should be treated humanely. <br/>[72] <br/><br/><br/> How Joe Biden Has Damaged Transatlantic Unity[73] <br/> by Ted Galen Carpenter <br/> Expectations were high on both sides of the Atlantic when Joe Biden won the U.S. presidential election that transatlantic comity and cooperation would be restored, and that Donald Trump's abrasive, destructive diplomacy soon would be merely a painful memory. Biden's initial statements as president reinforced those expectations. In his inaugural address, the new president stressed that 'We will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again.' <br/> A month later, Biden amplified that goal and applied it with special emphasis to Washington's relationship to its European allies in his speech to a virtual version of the annual Munich Security Conference. He stated that 'I'm sending a clear message to the world: America is back. The transatlantic alliance is back. And we are not looking backward; we are looking forward, together.' He added: 'The partnership between Europe and the United States, in my view, is and must remain the cornerstone of all that we hope to accomplish in the 21st century, just as we did in the 20th century.' In an unmistakable slap at his predecessor, Biden acknowledged that 'I know the past few years have strained and tested our transatlantic relationship, but the United States is determined — determined to reengage with Europe, to consult with you, to earn back our position of trusted leadership.' <br/> The sense of relief in European circles after the Trump years was almost palpable. 'Biden gave exactly the speech that many Europeans wanted to hear,' wrote Germany's influential Der Spiegel magazine. It was a widely shared sentiment on the Continent. <br/> In the aftermath of the chaotic and humiliating departure of U.S. forces from Afghanistan, and the reaction of European governments to that episode,' the president's promises and confident hopes of transatlantic unity have been shaken to their core. Armin Laschet, a leading German politician, described the situation in especially harsh terms. 'This is the greatest debacle that NATO has seen since its foundation, and it is an epochal change that we are facing,' he stated bluntly. <br/> [] <br/>[74] <br/><br/><br/>MasterCard Used Its Dominance to Dictate Online Platform Rules, Then Launched Its Own Digital ID System to Capitalize on it[75] <br/> Back in April, Mastercard, one of the world's biggest credit card companies, imposed a new policy on who can use its services, specifically around 'illegal adult content.' <br/> Sites that host such content as defined by Mastercard (which, critics said, conflates illegal with all adult content) are required to provide proof of identity and age of those appearing in the streams and videos — and have an appeals process that would let any person appearing in videos request to have them removed. <br/>[76] <br/><br/><br/> New Yorker Hosts Environmental Extremist Calling for Eco-Terrorism, Pipeline Bombings[77] <br/> In the name of climate activism, The New Yorker has provided a platform for a far-left environmental extremist on its weekly podcast show. <br/> 'How To Blow Up A Pipeline' author Andreas Malm, an associate senior lecturer of human ecology at Lund University, was invited on Friday's episode of The New Yorker Radio Hour, where the professor's impassioned calls for eco-terrorism were amplified by the establishment outlet's radio program. <br/> Pontificating on how to save the planet from the fossil fuel industry, The New Yorker guest implored the environmental movement to embrace violence. <br/>[78] <br/><br/><br/> No Local Delays Monday Morning After Social Media Call for Nationwide Highway Protests[79] <br/> Videos on some social media platforms last week called for a nationwide protest on major roadways during the Monday morning commute, however it didn't come to fruition in the Miami Valley. <br/> Videos that appeared on TikTok last week called for the #PatriotShutdown, a planned protest by truckers in the name of medical freedom.

The region is struggling to deal with a wave of migrants sent to the European Union by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, and despite police efforts, there is no sign that the wave is letting up. <br/> Groups of Iraqis, Syrians, and Afghans are now coming to Germany via Poland, and <br/> 'There were 40 on Monday, 69 on Tuesday, and 80 on Wednesday,' said Olaf Jansen, head of the reception center in Eisenhüttenstadt. <br/>[150] <br/><br/><br/> Macron, Liberal French Government Allocate €1 Billion to Healthcare for Illegal Migrants in 2022[151] <br/>French President Emmanuel Macron's France announced last week that the state's 2022 budget will reserve €1 billion in medical aid for 'free' healthcare to illegal immigrants.

Neither party has seen the benefit of training and retaining UK workers rather than taking the cheaper option of foreign drivers,' lamented Alp Mehmet, chairman of the migration sceptic think tank, in comments sent to Breitbart London, of the shortages, which have caused widespread panic-buying of fuel despite industry assurances that there is enough supply to meet demand at British refineries and terminals. <br/>[160] <br/><br/><br/> Video: Texas Students Agree With Biden Border Policy, Until They See the Pictures[161] <br/> Video shot by Campus Reform reveals students at the University of Texas campus in San Antonio lauding Joe Biden's immigration policies, right up until they are shown pictures of thousands of migrants living in squalor under a bridge in Del Rio. <br/> 'That's more than I was expecting', one student said, with another proclaiming 'That — I do believe it's a problem.' <br/>[162] <br/><br/><br/> Video: Even CNN Calls Out 'Patently False' Border Patrol 'Whipping'[163] <br/> After a week of the Biden administration and Democrats pushing fake news that border patrol agents whipped migrants, and even removing them from duty, even CNN's Jake Tapper described the story as 'patently false' during an interview with DHS Chief Alejandro Mayorkas. <br/> 'Some of the initial descriptions of those images were just patently false,' Tapper said, adding 'There's now video out there that provides more context.' <br/>[164] <br/><br/><br/>Swiss Voters Approve Same-Sex Marriage in Referendum[165] <br/> In a Sunday referendum, the Swiss voted to legalize same-sex marriages, the DPA reported. In total, 64.1 percent of the Swiss agreed to 'marriage for all,' with the proposal receiving the support of more than half of the citizens in all 26 cantons.

That same year, Michigan native Christopher Schurr traveled to Kenya for a mission trip, where he and his then fiance (both white Americans) married. On the morning of April 4th, 2022, the two men would meet for the first and last time. </p><p><br/>Early that morning, Lyoya was pulled over by Schurr—now a police officer in Grand Rapids, Michigan's second largest city—allegedly for driving with an unregistered license plate. In a matter of minutes, the traffic stop turned into a foot chase (a high-risk behavior increasingly discouraged in police reform circles), a struggle, and ultimately, an execution. While pinning Lyoya down and kneeling on his back, Schurr fatally shot Lyoya in the back of the head[1]. <br/>More than two months later, on June 9th, Kent County prosecutor Chris Becker announced murder charges against Schurr, in a rare[2] but welcome turn of events. This is an important development in the fight for greater accountability for police use of deadly force. Over the past two months, local leaders and activists have kept up the pressure. Groups like the Grand Rapids Association of Pastors, which includes the support of nearly 70 local pastors from across denominations[3]; the Grand Rapids NAACP, the Black civil rights organization; and other local leaders have been pressing authorities for transparency, accountability, and police reform in Grand Rapids. The police department there has been under investigation since 2019 by the Michigan Department of Civil Rights[4]. In his statement[5], Becker argues that Schurr's use of deadly force cannot be characterized as self defense. The defense disagrees, saying Lyoya's murder was 'justified.'[6] The Lyoya family will now have to endure the lengthy and painful legal battle ahead. <br/>Perhaps Schurr's mission trip to Kenya[7] is irrelevant to this latest example of America's lethal problem of over-policing of Black communities. But we should acknowledge the cruel irony of a White Savior dressed in blue—who dressed 'like an African' for his Christian mission wedding—pinning down a Congolese refugee and fatally shooting him in the back of the head in the name of self-defense. Not only was Patrick Lyoya the victim of a violent reality in America where Black people are nearly three times as likely to be killed by police than white people[8]. He was also the victim of American austerity economics where policing stands in as a response to the defunding of social services[9] and resettlement means acculturating to the impossible mathematics of pulling oneself up by their bootstraps without a safety net. <br/>Born in Uvira, Democratic Republic of Congo, 26-year-old Patrick Lyoya lived for over a decade in the Dzaleka refugee camp[10] in Malawi (the camp receives 300 new arrivals on average monthly, the majority from the DRC) before being resettled with his family in Lansing, Michigan's state capital, at the age of 18. According to The Washington Post[11], Peter and Dorcas Lyoya worked 'odd jobs,' and the family of eight shared a small apartment when they first moved to Michigan. Patrick Lyoya later moved to Grand Rapids where he moved between family and friends' homes and where he most recently worked on the factory floor of an auto manufacturing plant. Not long before he was killed, Patrick had just moved into his own place, a milestone for the 26-year-old refugee. <br/>According to people close to him, Lyoya worked hard to take care of his family. He wanted to buy or build a home for his mother as part of his quest to achieve a comfortable middle-class American life. He was also a father of two and an active member of the Congolese community, where he was known to help new arrivals find their footing. Lyoya attended the Restoration Community Church of the United Methodist Church, where Pastor Banza Mukalay, also a refugee who resettled in the US, remembered him as a hard working young man who 'tried to make his future better.'[12] <br/>As much reporting has highlighted, Patrick's life was complicated. According to Pastor Joshua Munonge Kibezi of Kalamazoo, MI,[13] who lived in Malawi as a refugee with the Lyoyas, Patrick sometimes worked three jobs to support himself and his family. But existing media profiles have highlighted Patrick's legal troubles dating back to 2015 without meaningfully reflecting on the ways in which resettlement policies intersect with anti-Black biases in America[14] that place refugees like Patrick firmly into a violent cycle of over-policing and under-resourcing of Black immigrant lives. <br/>In recent years, Grand Rapids, MI, has become an important place of resettlement for refugees from the DRC. According to one source[15], between March and October of 2019, 319 out of 490 refugees who resettled in Michigan were Congolese. And according to resettlement agency Bethany Christian Services, Grand Rapids was becoming the 'no. 1 place'[15] that Congolese refugees requested for resettlement as part of the process of 'secondary migration' by which refugees seek to follow or reunite with family members through the resettlement process. As of 2019, Grand Rapids was home to about 8,000 refugees from the DRC and 11 Congolese churches. <br/>However, national resettlement numbers have significantly declined in recent years, particularly under the former Trump administration. This has meant that social services have also been slashed. Resettling in the US is exceptionally hard, as sociologist Heba Gowayed[16] shows in her new book that details American resettlement policies and their implications for Syrian refugees. Resettlement in America relies heavily on the notion of 'self-sufficiency,' treating newcomers as 'American low-income workers' and denying them crucial services for integrating into American economic and social life. <br/>But the story doesn't end there. Where state and federal support services fall short, the growing Congolese refugee community in Michigan has been working hard to uplift and support its members. Pastor Kibezi (who was close to Patrick) runs a nonprofit called African Community Kalamazoo[17]. It gained official nonprofit status in 2019, formed to 'cater to the needs of all Africans, African refugees in Kalamazoo County, Michigan and by extension, the United States. Also, we promote the unity of Africans, and support the development of our host community.' Among their services, African Community Kalamazoo works to ensure members of the community have adequate access to food, translation, and interpretation services for non-English speaking immigrants and refugees within the community. (You can make a donation to their cause here[18].) According to their website, they are currently working to open a childcare center and provide help with finding affordable housing solutions for its community members. They are also looking for volunteers and donations of household goods, including food and diapers. Patrick Lyoya was involved in this work, too[19]—work that the refugee community is doing to improve the lives of those whom American resettlement practices have failed to protect and uplift. <br/>Now, in light of the recent tragedy that has struck the refugee and Black community of Grand Rapids, Patrick's father, Peter, cautions[20] those who may be thinking about seeking asylum in the area: 'I want to say for those people who are seeking asylum here, refuge, I don't want you to think this is a safe place. I thought it was a safe place, but it seems like we are in danger even when we come here.' As Swahili speakers, the Lyoyas have relied on translators for interviews. It is unclear from media reports how strong Patrick's English skills were—but New York Times reporting[7] indicates that language was a barrier for him, possibly even in his encounter with Schurr on April 4th. <br/>Earlier this month, Michigan banned Swahili (and Spanish) dictionaries in its prisons, claiming that the 'books' contents are a threat to the state's penitentiaries.'[21] But this move begs the question: how many among the growing Congolese population in Michigan are landing in the prison system? Statistics are not readily available. However, data compiled by the Vera Institute of Justice[22] shows that while Black people make up 15% of Michigan's population, they make up 53% of the state's prison population (and 37% of its jail population). According to The New York Times,[7] Patrick Lyoya had spent some time in and out of jail. And according to some readers' comments, Patrick's legal troubles seem to justify his murder, which is a sad reflection of how too many Americans uncritically think about crime—violent and nonviolent—as a reflection of the individual more than as a reflection of America's austerity economics and deepening social divides. <br/>Patrick Lyoya's case has drawn national attention. The Reverend Al Sharpton eulogized Patrick at his funeral on April 22nd, and Patrick's parents hired well-known civil rights attorney Ben Crump. Davionne Smith, a Black Lives Matter activist and cousin to Breonna Taylor (a Grand Rapids native), has helped organize marches calling for justice for Patrick and his family. <br/>Patrick Lyoya's life mattered.

As the nation takes a day to memorialize its military dead, those who are living are facing a deadly risk that has nothing to do with war or conflict: the coronavirus.Different groups face different degrees of danger from the pandemic, from the elderly who are experiencing deadly outbreaks in nursing homes[2] to communities of color with higher infection and death rates[3]. Veterans are among the most hard-hit[4], with heightened health and economic threats from the pandemic. These veterans face homelessness, lack of health care, delays in receiving financial support and even death.I have spent the past four years studying veterans with substance use and mental health disorders who are in the criminal justice system[5]. This work revealed gaps in health care and financial support for veterans, even though they have the best publicly funded[6] benefits[7] in the country.Here are eight ways the pandemic threatens veterans:   1. Age and other vulnerabilities Vietnam War veterans at the Memorial Day observance at Arlington National Cemetery, May 30, 2016. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas In 2017[8], veterans' median age was 64, their average age was 58 and 91% were male. </p><p>The largest group served in the Vietnam era, where 2.8 million veterans were exposed to Agent Orange[9], a chemical defoliant linked to cancer.Younger veterans deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan were exposed to dust storms, oil fires and burn pits with numerous toxins[10], and perhaps as a consequence have high rates of asthma and other respiratory illnesses[11].Age and respiratory illnesses are both risk factors for COVID-19 mortality. As of May 22[12], there have been 12,979 people under Veterans Administration care with COVID-19, of whom 1,100 have died. 2. Dangerous residential facilities Veterans needing end-of-life care, those with cognitive disabilities or those needing substance use treatment often live in crowded VA or state-funded residential facilities.State-funded ""soldiers' homes"" are notoriously starved for money and staff. The horrific situation[13] at the soldiers' home in Holyoke, Massachusetts, where more than 79 veteran residents have died from a COVID-19 outbreak[14], illustrates the risk facing the veterans in residential homes. 3. Benefits unfairly denied A transition clerk assists a Reservist with his Department of Defense Form 214 as part of the demobilizing process, at Fort Bliss, March 6, 2015. US Army/Adam Holguin When a person transitions from active military service to become a veteran, they receive a Certificate of Discharge or Release[15]. This certificate provides information about the circumstances of the discharge or release. It includes characterizations such as ""honorable,"" ""other than honorable,"" ""bad conduct"" or ""dishonorable."" These are crucial distinctions, because that status determines whether the Veterans Administration will give them benefits[16].Research shows that some veterans with discharges that limit their benefits have PTSD symptoms, military sexual trauma or other behaviors related to military stress. Veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan have disproportionately more[17] of these negative discharges than veterans from other eras, for reasons still unclear[18].The Veterans Administration frequently and perhaps unlawfully[19] denies benefits to veterans with ""other than honorable"" discharges.Many veterans have requested upgrades to their discharge status. There is a significant backlog of these upgrade requests[20], and the pandemic will add to it, further delaying access to health care and other benefits. 4. Diminished access to healthcare Dental surgery, routine visits and elective surgeries at Veterans Administration medical centers have been postponed since mid-March. VA hospitals are understaffed[21] - just before the pandemic, the VA reported 43,000 staff vacancies out of more than 400,000 health care staff positions. Access to health care will be even more difficult when those medical centers finally reopen because they may have far fewer workers than they need.As of May 4, 2020, 2,250 VA health care workers[22] have tested positive for COVID-19, and thousands of health care workers are under quarantine. The VA is asking doctors and nurses[23] to come out of retirement to help already understaffed hospitals. 5. Mental health may get worse Veterans and military personnel at a military job fair in Sandy, Utah, March 26, 2019. Reuters An average of 20 veterans die by suicide every day. A national task force[24] is currently addressing this scourge.But many outpatient mental health programs are on hold or being held virtually[25]. Some residential mental health facilities have closed[26].Under these conditions, the suicide rate for veterans may grow. Suicide hotline calls by veterans were up by 12% on March 22, just a few weeks into the crisis[27]. 6. Complications for homeless veterans and those in the justice system An estimated 45,000 veterans[28] are homeless on any given night, and 181,500 veterans[29] are in prison or jail. Thousands more are under court-supervised substance use and mental health treatment in veterans treatment courts[30]. More than half[31] of veterans involved with the justice system have either mental health problems or substance use disorders.As residential facilities close to new participants, many veterans eligible to leave prison or jail have nowhere to go. They may stay incarcerated or become homeless.Courts have moved online[32] or ceased formal operations altogether, meaning no veteran charged with a crime can be referred to a treatment court. It is unclear whether those who were already participating in a treatment program will face delays graduating from court-supervised treatments.Further, some veterans treatment courts still require participants to take drug tests[33]. With COVID-19 circulating, those participants must put their health at risk to travel to licensed testing facilities. 7. Disability benefits delayed US Army veteran Kenneth Fuller, 92, shakes hands with Filipino World War II veteran Jose Kilatan, 100, during Veterans Day ceremonies at the American cemetery in Taguig city, Manila, November 11, 2015. REUTERS/Ezra Acayan In the pandemic's epicenter in New York, tens of thousands of veterans[34] should have access to VA benefits because of their low income - but don't, so far.The pandemic has exacerbated existing delays in finding veterans in need, filing their paperwork and waiting for decisions. Ryan Foley, an attorney in New York's Legal Assistance Group, a nonprofit legal services organization, noted in a personal communication that these benefits are worth ""tens of millions of dollars to veterans and their families"" in the midst of a health and economic disaster.All 56 regional Veterans Administration offices are closed[35] to encourage social distancing. Compensation and disability evaluations, which determine how much money veterans can get, are usually done in person. Now, they must be done electronically, via telehealth services in which the veteran communicates with a health care provider via computer.But getting telehealth up and running is taking time, adding to the longstanding VA backlog[36]. Currently, more than 100,000 veterans[37] wait more than 125 days for a decision. (That is what the VA defines as a backlog - anything less than 125 days is not considered a delay on benefit claims.) 8. Economic catastrophe There are 1.2 million veteran employees in the five industries most severely affected[38] by the economic fallout of the coronavirus.A disproportionately high number of post-9/11 veterans live in some of the hardest-hit communities that depend on these industries. Veterans returning from overseas will face a dire economic landscape, with far fewer opportunities to integrate into civilian life with financial security.In addition, severely disabled veterans living off of VA benefits were initially required to file a tax return to get stimulus checks[39]. This initial filing requirement delayed benefits for severely disabled veterans by at least a month. The IRS finally changed the requirements[40] after public outcry, given that many older and severely disabled veterans do not have access to computers or the technological skills to file electronically.There are many social groups to pay attention to, all with their own problems to face during the pandemic. With veterans, many of the problems they face now existed long before the coronavirus arrived on U.S. shores.But with the challenges posed by the situation today, veterans who were already lacking adequate benefits and resources are now in deeper trouble, and it will be harder to answer their needs.Editor's note: This is an updated version of a story[41] that originally ran on April 16, 2020.[Deep knowledge, daily.
