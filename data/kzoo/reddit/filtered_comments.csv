I am a lawyer in Michigan. Fair warning, this is not legal advice, feel free to reach out to me directly if you are having issues and we can discuss your personal situation.

On September 1, 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued an [order](https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2020-19654.pdf) that halts certain residential evictions through December 31, 2020. (The CARES Act eviction moratorium expired on July 24, 2020. Pub L 116-136, 134 Stat 281 (2020).) The order cites the Public Health Service Act, [42 USC 264](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/264), as authority for this order. The order notes that “COVID-19 presents a historic threat to public health” and that eviction moratoria can be an effective public health measure used in the context of a pandemic to prevent the spread of disease.

Under the order, a landlord or owner of a residential property may not evict any “covered person” from any residential property. A “covered person” is any tenant, lessee, or resident who provides to their landlord a declaration that

* they have used their best efforts to obtain government assistance for rent;
* they expect to earn no more than $99,000 in 2020, were not required to report any income in 2019, or received a stimulus check under the CARES Act;
* they are unable to pay the full rent due to a substantial loss of income, reduced work hours, layoff, or extraordinary out-of-pocket medical expenses;
* they are using their best efforts to make timely partial payments as close to the full payment as circumstances permit; and
* eviction would likely render them homeless or force them to move into and live in close quarters in a shared housing situation.

If you are in a place where you may be evicted because of the COVID 19 shutdown, you may wish to consider following the guidance the CDC put out in their moratorium.

And the problem isn't the landlords themselves. for the most part, they are simply trying to eke out a living. the problem is Corporate ""landlords"" that buy up available land for the express purpose of being able to charge a premium for a necessary but limited resource.

I am asking genuinely. I am a homeowner for the past 5 years, and it seems to me that annually, my maintenance costs are ***significantly*** lower than what my rent was prior to buying a larger house in a better neighborhood. Even if I ended up replacing every single appliance and fixture in my house over the course of a year, I don't think it would even come close to the annual cost of rent. I concede that I may be outside of the norm in terms of cost, hence the question.

>who's going to pay for it?

The community, but more to the point, land and housing costs are artificially high for reasons I stated in my original comment. Abolish (at the least) corporate landlords and see where the chips fall. I suspect the cost of living would be much better for everyone, myself a homeowner included. 

>Who's going to maintain it

The same ones that maintain it now - contractors. at best, landlords serve as a (very expensive) middleman between the tenet and the contractor. 

>Who's going to accept liability for the property?

The community. we pay more taxes keeping our homeless population alive than we would maintaining housing for them.

Not to be obtuse, but...why? In the US alone there are approximately 31 vacant homes for every single homeless person in the country. they are empty and serve no purpose - less than no purpose because we criminalize ""squatting"", so people that could actually use them are driven away.

This is almost certainly a penny-wise pound foolish move as most people are going to be underwater if they have a financed vehicle. In this case my friend has a 2008 Hyundai elantra so there isn't really anywhere down to go

>most importantly YES GET WHATEVER JOB HE CAN

Yeah no shit. Nowhere did I say that folks shouldn't be getting what job they can. But that getting such a job will still VERY LIKELY NOT COVER THEIR BILLS Even with reducing expenditures. 

>What does how much he was making before matter?

Because most people base their finances off how much money they're making? Idk. Something like that. They base what car they get, how much their housing is etc off how much they make. Sure there are places to cut corners when you have to tighten the old belt, but there are relatively fixed expenses that can't be avoided. Student loan debt, Rent/Mortgages, Car Payments, utilities, insurance, etc. are all things that you can't just drop. And if you had a good financial plan before and had your proper savings you're still going to be suffering after 6 months of being out of work.

>Again, once all the help wanted signs are gone, then we can start issuing general proclamations, but until then, you're asking me to subsidise pride (too good for ""that"" job) and sloth (easier to be on government programs than work). I will do neither.

No No I'm not. That's a completely irrational argument and not at all what I said. What I said is it's entirely possible for folks who were very recently middle class and living within their means to now be in a position where even if they get 2-3 jobs they still won't be able to make ends meet. I'm not saying they shouldn't get a job, I'm saying they'll still need help even while working. 

>I fought quite loudly for them to open the damn schools, given all the science that says that if you're under 20, covid is less deadly than the flu, and if you're between 20-45 it is roughly as deadly.

Yeah and that's illogical because it ignores the health of the teachers, administrators, parents, caregivers for the children. Sure kids may no die, but shit I just turned 30 and COVID gave me a goddamn heart condition that I'm now on medication for. We do not know the long term effects of COVID. But let us say for the sake of argument that kids are relatively unaffected and have no long term issues. The teachers, ranging from early 20's college graduates to early 60's close to retirement teachers are not immune. Neither are the parents or grandparents that the students live with. 

> But I'll be god-damned if I'm working, and the whole fast food industry, grocery industry, farmers, factory workers, cops, ems, firefighters, etc,etc are working, many with reduced hours, but your ""friends"" are too good to work!

So glad I quit my job. Nah They all got shit canned when this kicked off and their industries haven't recovered. My brother is a journalist and got laid off during this because subscriptions dropped because folks don't have enough money to keep paying for a paper. They laid off like 30% of his office. Luckily he's lower income so it'll be easier for him to find something to sustain his finances.

We all understand what it means for something to be illegal, probably better than you. The fact that you don’t understand this argument is about the constitutionality and morality of of the drug war is abundantly clear—so let me lay this out for you:

Here in America, we have the freedom of speech  and the freedom of religion. Freedom of speech necessarily requires that you have freedom of thought—to decide how you think. Consuming any mind altering substance is an adults choice to choose how they think. We already regulate alcohol—tobacco—pharmaceuticals—we have a precedent for taxing and regulating drugs.

In the 1970’s the Nixon administration was facing all kinds of civil unrest from the civil rights movement. With no recourse—they specifically chose drugs popular with the poor and impoverished—and they made the punishments as extreme as possible. By this mechanism—they cleared out all the adult-aged makes, political dissidents, intellectuals. And they still do to this day.

As far back as human history goes, human beings have consumed mind-altering substances—be it alcohol for social situations, relaxation—or the spiritual peyote, mushroom, cannabis ceremonies.

We know from every instance in history—most recently alcohol prohibition—that prohibition does not work. Particularly in the case of addiction, which we now recognize for what it is—a medical condition, these people will always seek these substances. If you’re in the jungle, the arctic, an American upper-class household.

So, knowingly taking money and grants to enforce laws that were specifically intended to target human behaviors that are universal—and deeply ingrained is the new racism. And they leveraged it as planned. They used it as an excuse to arrest nearly any person they could ever want.

Now here we are, 50 years after the start of the drug war, and things are worse than when we started. Who else would be allowed to lose a war for 50 years and continue.

And as a result, we have the largest prison population per capita of any country. And that large prison population is predominantly non-violent drug offenders. People who were arrested for possession and nothing else.

But most of these people being sent away for exactly this are minorities, African Americans, the poor, the homeless. While they’re in prison, they’re not home to be a role model, they’re not there to keep their kid in school, keep them out of gangs, keep their kids away from drugs and alcohol.

I agree with you here. Like 100%!!! You are dead right, so we need to lock down our southern border.

There are exactly zero people on the street because they needed space.  There is no housing crisis here, there is an addiction and mental illness crisis.  Giving homes, specifically under your argument, someone else's home, to the mentally ill and/or addicted isn't going to do anything but trash the house.

> People need houses, and there are an abundance of homes sitting vacant all across the country.

Ok, well, shouldn't we just give the unemployed jobs building homes for the homeless then? That's the kind of logic a 8th grader might think is deep.  We have resource, so let's just give it away!!!!!  That won't work.  Nobody is homeless because they lack a home.  They're homeless because they're addicted and/or disabled.

> Look I don't want to fight,

That makes a LOT of sense.  What you are suggesting is indefensible.

> just try view this in a kinder light.

Yes, there are those of us who know that stealing is wrong, and people who advocate stealing from person ""a"" to give to person ""b"" is extremely unkind to person ""a"" while wanting to take credit from person ""b"".

> I know these issues can make people uncomfortable or even afraid

Nah, I'd say pissed.  I pay my goddamn taxes.  I mow my goddamn lawn. I own my goddamn house and my goddamn car.  The city/state sees me as a piggy bank they can extort funds from.  For that, I goddamn expect my shit not to get stolen by you.

> They deserve basic human kindness, and housing IS a necessity.

Something I agree with 100%. It's just that stealing a house isn't providing housing, and nothing you've suggested is kindness at all.  Treatment and actual help would go a long way.

> Troubled as they might be, imagine they needed a place to live, not that they're here to make trouble.

Hey!!!! That's my suggestion to you when I drop a few homeless off at your place.  How many sqft do you have?  I want to make sure I'm not overcrowding you.  We'll say 1 homeless per 80sqft, that might be cozy, but

I do not go through downtown a lot and was stunned at the number of homeless people hanging around on the sidewalks, corners and in front of gas stations. There were so many people. Also people standing in the road either with signs or people who were obviously not mentally stable who were dancing and singing in traffic. 

I did not mention this abundance of unhoused people to my dad as we were driving but instead picked conversation topics that were light but I could tell the people standing in traffic made him uneasy because they were standing IN traffic.

I just say on Friday will  chill couple by the Kalamazoo River who honestly- I didn’t know they were homeless until we got to chatting. Talked all about the good, bad, the ugly, the scorching summer and the frigid winters. Talked about having to sleep in his car and she at the Mission.
Street Meds of Kalamazoo comes downtown every Wednesday 1pm. It’s a mobile medical team that comes down to help that population: vaccines, care for diabetes, high BP, injuries, sick adults and kids- they help make other medical appts if needed, connect them with social workers etc. 
Many of the homeless population were really counting on Kalamazoo to follow through with the proposed pod community- they dropped the ball too. Unreal.

You’re very right. There ARE a subset that don’t want to be inside or have any responsibility what so ever, engage in public defecation, violence and theft. It’s becoming more pervasive.
But there are a group of really cool, kind, respectful of nature type humans out there. Several moms with kids…extended family cousins etc
This city needs to get its shit together. And fast.
Housing and assistance needs to be made available for those that should have  interview and pass into a spot and those that don’t qualify need to be moved along to rehab. Ordinances need to be put in place to keep areas safer for residents. This is driving SO many people out of and away from downtown. 
Thank you to the Republican Regime who closed all the psychiatric hospitals and flooded the streets. 
These things need to change… resident of this city shouldn’t be afraid to use their own parks and nature trails.
This isn’t the Kalamazoo that’s going to attract talent and retain it: professors for the med and nursing school, healthcare providers and teachers…engineers and other skilled trade workers. Employees that WANT to come here for Stryker, Pfizer & Zoetis.

The ecosystem has healthy and unhealthy parts as a whole. An oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico doesn't make that much of a difference to fish living in the Great Lakes.

There's a reason shelter is at the base of the hierarchy of needs.  So much in our society requires a permanent address, and so much becomes impossible if you don't have somewhere safe and consistent to sleep.

Most of these people ARE capable of taking care of themselves.  And those who aren't can't exactly get services when they're sleeping in a hedge; housing gives them a place they can keep medications, a place they can bathe, a place they can keep more than the food they can carry.  A place they don't have to worry about some well-meaning person ""cleaning up"" their belongings, or the city coming in and wiping their home away.

They can't be assisted with mental healthcare, therapy, medications, physical healthcare, job training or placement, nothing, without a place to live.

And remember, not every homeless person is a drug addict or schizophrenic or what have you.  There are plenty of people out there who are homeless because they were injured and lost a job, or a landlord cranked up rent and evicted them and they lost a job because they had to deal with it, or a spouse died during the pandemic and they couldn't handle without the income.  These people aren't incapable of taking care of themselves.

I would argue that the public impression of homelessness comes from the people who are most desperate and most driven to be aggressively begging or who have mental health issues; plenty more spend time at the library applying for jobs, or are otherwise just aware that being aggressive is unlikely to help and just don't.

A functional alcoholic is still an alcoholic, re: an addict.

It’s not irrelevant at all. It’s in fact quite relevant. Most of America is addicted to *something.* So addiction isn’t a cause of homelessness for sure. Certainly, it doesn’t help to have a maladaptive coping mechanism like getting so fucking zooted you don’t know where you are when you’re trying to get out of homelessness. But if you know what its like to hit that relaxing buzz as you finish your third Busch Lite after a long hard day of work, then you maybe have an idea of what its like to get high to escape The Horrors of the Street.

I was close at one point and only avoided it because I had family that was in a position to help me out. Not everybody had that support system. For most average people these days it only takes a few bad months to lose everything. 

A large amount of the unhoused population has physical or mental illnesses that are difficult to deal with. When they get meds to treat those illnesses they are often stolen because resale value is so high. Addiction treatment in this country is also a joke which lead to people losing everything and stealing from others (such as above) to be able to afford their next fix. Even those who just fell on hard times (no illness/addiction) have difficulty struggling out of the cycle. Trying to look for a job when unhoused is very difficult. Most places require online applications so you have to find a public access computer to apply with. Even if you get an interview generally you and your clothes are dirty because there is nowhere to clean up and clean your clothing. You will be judged harshly if you show up to an interview that way. Also you have to get the call for the interview in the first place and since phones are one of the first items stolen on the street you may not have ready access to a phone. There is also the problem of getting to the interview. What happens if the interview is not near public transport? Reliable transport to work is often a question on an application or in an interview. I have even seen the question “do you own a car?”. If you have two candidates that are equally qualified you would probably pick the one with reliable transportation. There are so many other issues the unhoused deal with when trying to become housed so a little compassion goes a long way. 

Also food for thought… the places that make homelessness illegal just end up sending their unhoused to jail… where they pay for their housing, food, medical bills, and to be monitored. Basically they pay for all the things they are asking for help with but saddle them with a record that then makes it harder to find a job and find housing when they get out of jail. It creates a cycle of homelessness to incarceration that is extremely difficult to escape.",4,2024-01-10 18:52:14 UTC

This is actually straight up the way to solve homelessness. It is the most direct, most applicable solution to the problem of people not having shelter. This statement needs to be supported. Housing the homeless “doesn’t work” how? What “doesn’t work”?

>“American society in general provides ample opportunity despite what some may tell you to provide first yourself”

American society actively maintains homelessness as a stick for the capitalist system we operate under. The majority of people are one or two bad months away from homelessness ***BY MEANS THAT AN INDIVIDUAL HAS NO CONTROL OVER***. When the majority of American workers cannot afford a $400 emergency expense, you’re looking at a workforce that’s two bad events they have no control over from being homeless.

This is, of course, before we consider the number of unhoused people who are in the workforce, earning an income, and not being able to afford shelter in the area in which they work.

The difficulty with an issue like homelessness is not that money is an inefficient nonsolution. The difficulty is that our society is constructed in a way that uses homelessness as a threatened outcome for nonparticipation in capitalism, and a punishment for those deemed as unable or unproductive. The difficulty is that solving homelessness is actually simple, but that simplicity doesn’t include an ability to profit off of that solution.",1,2024-01-13 14:59:44 UTC

However i have to disagree. Since there is so much information available on why throwing money at homelessness doesnt work accessible with a quick google or chatgpt ill just hit on some basic reasons why just housing the homeless doesnt work though it seems like it by definition should work as you mentioned. Housing the homeless has been shown to be a futile endeavor that is not only unsustainable but causes irreparable damage to the communities that embark on this foolish task. Much part due to incentive structures . 
One of the issues with well intentioned ideas based on kind simple feelings is that one, it makes naive assumptions about people and how they operate and two they many times fail to take into account the complexity of issues. Some system
 may exist that could solve homeless, but if it does it has not been figured out despite the billions of dollars thrown at this issue. You see id say homelessness is not a weapon used against those poor participants of capitalism, but is rather a threat to capitalism itself, hence the large spending to try and solve it! (It seems this is mostly due to the nature of humans) Many people who are anticapitalist seem to suggest the system exploits people to the highest degree possible (which in a game theoretic view should be expected). There is evidence for this, but it is not as simple nor as sinister as one might believe. Maximum exploitation exists in everything humans do(those poor poor naive communists). Economics in its wild multivariate web sometimes has unintuitive consequences. Capitalism in a negative sense can seem harsh, but not only is it the best proven system, in reality it is just a system that incentivizes productivity and removes the hinderances. Maybe not perfect, there will always be people who are not well off, but it is also the system that has quickly brought up the standard of living of the entire world very quickly. Oh also, to say solving homelessness is a net zero or negative EV endeavor is not correct. You say capitalism is predatory and seeks to maximize profits.

Suppose you house all the homeless. Not considering where this money comes from, now you have created some income threshold where in which being homeless and getting free housing and government funds is better than being independent. This area is now a newly created issue. Now those people will be incentivized to seek government housing creating more issues. (Maximum exploitation! John Nash save us with your beautiful mind) Another thought experiment, suppose of those who seek government shelter an optimistic 1 percent of them do not have any motive to ever move out. Overtime this number obviously will grow since that one percent will stay and 1 percent of the next wave will stay now causing a large unsustainable homeless population that is being housed with tax payer money who have no incentive to ever stop burdening the community.

Where I take issue with your position is your lack of sources (google and chatgpt are not sources), and the fact you point at incentive structures as being part of the issue when the incentive structures cited are informed explicitly by their existence within capitalism. Citing “human nature” is also trash, since human nature includes both the altruism to ensure people are taken care of as well as the want to exploit or self destruct. Human nature as we take it is informed by the kind of societies we’ve constructed for ourselves.

If housing the homeless “irreparably damages the communities that embark on this foolish task” i have to ask how much work that community has done on folding those people into the community rather than continuing to treat those housed this way as social pariahs.

I think the idea that humans are exploitative (in a derogatory sense) is a gross misnomer, as humanity has managed to exploit the relationships that exist within nature to the benefit of both humans and nature. Our society today would not exist were it not for the strength of the human social instinct. Our strength is our numbers, our sociability, and our ingenuity.

Capitalism incentivizes self centered self interest at the expense of those around us. It incentivizes competition in areas where cooperation is a more effective approach. It incentivizes the collection and sequestering of resources away from those who might need those resources. It incentivizes creating gates around things that do not have to be gated in order to construct a path to profit.

At the end of the day, solving homelessness is a socialist and communist project, and not a capitalist one.

Yes, we agree on this. This is *the* barrier to addressing macro social issues like homelessness. We *have* to accept that it is actually unquantifiable for how expensive it is to house everyone and integrate them into society in a manner that addresses their needs and their health. This is quite literally not about altruism, but about maintaining a healthy environment for all of us, which we should all be incentivized to do as a matter of continued self existence. You speak to capitalism’s incentive to house as many as possible within inescapable economic zones, but do not consider that one of those zones is homelessness, which is maintained as a function of capitalism.

You continue to argue from a perspective of the capitalist. Independence as a function of beneficial existence to the system of capitalism is not actually independence. You seem to think I want to draw an arbitrary line on provided housing and stipends. I would ask you to point to where I suggested that, because I didn’t. Those things should be universal.

The three major cities you point at have all failed at addressing homelessness the same way we’re failing to address it here, because we’re all approaching this from a capitalist framework that insists that *someone* has to make money off of the solution at the end of the day, and until we can collectively reconcile that that *will never happen* we **will** continue to fail to address the issue.",1,2024-01-13 17:48:08 UTC

Portage chips in $500K to turn Kalamazoo County hotel into homeless shelter,147,https://www.reddit.com/r/kzoo/comments/1fedtwn/portage_chips_in_500k_to_turn_kalamazoo_county/,2024-09-11 16:04:10 UTC,"This article is paywalled, but here's what it says:

PORTAGE, MI -- The city of Portage is contributing $500,000 to a countywide effort to establish an emergency shelter for families experiencing homelessness.
The money must be used for the “acquisition and/or construction of a shelter for families with children in Kalamazoo County,” per city documents.
The county has acquired a hotel in Kalamazoo that will be used as a shelter, Councilmember Terry Urban said. Further details about the project are not available at this time ― including which hotel this is.
Portage officials have been meeting with the city of Kalamazoo, Kalamazoo County, Southwest Michigan First and the Continuum of Care on a monthly basis to discuss housing challenges in the area for about five months, Portage City Manager Pat McGinnis said.
The city of Kalamazoo committed $1.2 million in COVID-19 relief funding to the same project a few weeks ago. Money from the county housing millage could also be used on the project, per Portage documents.

Though homelessness is most visible in the city of Kalamazoo, McGinnis said families and children are coming from all over the county -- including from Portage.
“In 2022 and 2023, we had 132 homeless kids in our public schools,” McGinnis said. “They need somewhere to live, hopefully with their siblings, with their parents.”

While housing projects for those who make 80% to 120% of the area median income are often presented to the council, this project will help people in the lowest income ranges, McGinnis said.

The project also comes as a response to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s decision to close Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) waiting lists for the foreseeable future.

With family homelessness on the rise and the housing voucher system closed, there will be an immediate need for emergency shelter space to prevent families with children from seeking shelter in substandard housing, according to city documents.

Earlier this year, the county’s Continuum of Care program counted 664 people were experiencing homelessness on the night of Jan. 23 in Kalamazoo County. That’s a 13% increase from 2023 and the highest mark in five years.",55,2024-09-11 16:06:27 UTC

You have the homeless who are mentally unwell, those that are addicts, those that have mental health issues AND are addicts, those who are capable of becoming employed and leading what we’d consider to be a normal life and those who are going to continuously find themselves in trouble with the law. 

There almost needs to be a social worker assigned to each individual or family to seek out a path to improve their situation, but even then there needs to be an alternative for when that fails. I think when that fails it’s either because of addiction, or if someone may just be so far gone mentally, or again someone just cannot stop committing crimes lol. IF we were to provide free medication to them there’s still no way to ensure they keep taking it. There has to be something like an institution where people can be supervised and cared for. Though idk what lands you in a state mental institution or if it requires like a family member admitting you? Hard to think of a solution that doesn’t in someway infringe on people’s freedoms, either way I think this requires so much individual attention than we’re giving it that it feels like just a scratch in the surface to get at least one category of homeless situation/cause under control, but it is better than nothing so generally I’m not even against what’s being proposed here.",3,2024-09-11 21:28:19 UTC

Kalamazoo had a reputation as being full of resources for homeless. Other cities and homeless elsewhere said “i want some!” They arrive and the resources here, meant for Kalamazoo homeless, are now depleted by homeless from the entire region. 

To fix the issue, they need to limit resources to native Kalamazoo homeless and make sure everyone knows it. But that sounds ridiculous, and will never happen, so Kalamazoo will continue to shelter and feed other cities’ homeless. 

Maybe the City folk and the shelters don’t realize this? Ask every homeless person where they are from, I bet 1/3 or less say Kalamazoo.

What's the deal with all the crazy homeless people at the train station?,67,https://www.reddit.com/r/kzoo/comments/1duy60k/whats_the_deal_with_all_the_crazy_homeless_people/,2024-07-04 04:29:07 UTC,"THANK YOU. Yes! I work in mental health and run an ACT Team, which basically works with exactly this population and other folks who struggle to live independently or go in and out of hospitals a lot due to severe, chronic mental health issues. I’m going to just enhance your already wonderful answer real quick for the folks that need to hear it. 

a) people do not realize the mental energy it takes to just survive when you’re homeless or about to be and that’s before you factor in any pre-existing mental disorders. 

b) my job is to help people stick to treatment, but often they have to seek out that treatment first, so see the first point above. 

c) I interned at the Mission for a summer and can confirm that it can feel very uncomfortable for non religious folks. Plus, with any shelter, they often can’t bring all their many bags of belongings in with them. Imagine losing your whole life and all you got is the stuff you can carry or push in a cart - clothes, family photos, your mom’s urn- and then being told you gotta leave it outside where anyone can go through it or steal it overnight. Also no pets allowed. Other people have trauma from being assaulted in similar shelters. I would choose the tent at that point. 

d) TicToc is making this worse. Every time I see a cute blonde girl showing what life is like living in her car, parked outside a Walmart with all her little privacy and safety gadgets, when it’s clear this is 100% by choice, I want to scream. 

e) What I tell people is if I’d lost everything and was living like that, I’d probably use some meth too. You can’t ask people to get sober when they are in an unimaginable situation where they don’t feel that they even have a life worth living. Help first, then healing. 

Thanks for letting me tag on to your comment. I have some very strong feelings about this subject, as you can see.",17,2024-07-04 12:09:08 UTC

This resulted in the gradual deinstitutionalization of long-term mental health programs starting with the 1963 Community Mental Health Act and 1965 reforms to social security.  This process really took off in the '70s with several court rulings which made it harder for institutions to confine someone and required institutions to pay the mentally handicapped for labor.  This progressive trend resulted in the closure or restructuring of a lot of long-term mental health facilities and the release of a large portion of those individuals back into public.  This resulted in a lot of strain of the existing mental health system, and reforms were obviously needed.  These too the form of a comprehensive [Mental Health Systems Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_Health_Systems_Act_of_1980) in 1980, signed by Carter.  However after Regan's taking power in 1981 most of the provisions of the Mental Health Systems Act were cut from the budget resulting in a very permissive system in the US (mentally ill patients can't be confined in most circumstances)bwhich does not have the funding to provide an adequate level of outpatient services to the population.  This combination of a poor social safety net plus a ""catch and release"" policy towards the mentally ill results in afflicted individuals disproportionately ending up in homeless shelters and jails.  Comprehensive reform risks expanding ""entitlements"" and social spending, which has been virtually impossible since the 80s due to increasing partisan gridlock and a hawkish Republican party on budget issues. This isn't to blame the Republicans exclusively, but to show how partisan gridlock and changing priorities leads to gutted and wasteful programs that don't serve their original purpose.  Even if one party took power in the senate and house and passed reform, the parties are so entrenched that it would likely be gutted by the next administration in 4-8 years.",45,2024-07-04 06:37:34 UTC

Which, in actuality many do get some kind of disability or social security. The problem here is that Michigan is a state where it is not mandatory for landlords to take section 8 housing vouchers and so there aren’t units available to this population due to landlords not wanting to participate in the section 8 system. The vouchers are only valid for 60 days and then expires and they have to start the process over again and hope they can get a voucher again. The problem with the in between ks all the waiting because in that time things get stolen, medications aren’t gotten, etc. 

Then the housing that the city built, the hotel they converted, which was suppose to be open in April has yet to still open and allow people to live there. The city isn’t using the pods again this year due to no location for them to be placed. There are many layers to the homeless issue here and everywhere else.

If we could just allow them to camp in one place, connect them with services, we can save tax payer money by the police and city coming to clean multiple sites and kicking people around the city when instead one location, a dumpster, port a potty and security would be easier and more contained until we figure out a better system.",56,2022-09-13 20:02:29 UTC

There’s been a lot coming out of the western cities lately about what is actually driving the “homeless” population. In reality, and there’s a great book called Sanfransicko written by someone actually in the “homeless” scene there, that describe the “homeless” encampment as actually being an Open Drug Scene. Now these ODS are more apt descriptions of the encampments, which is why I air quoted homeless. The term homeless is a misnomer and kind of implicitly innocent. We hear homessless and immediately think these are just friendly people on tough times. Don’t get me wrong, they are in need of state intervention AND financial support. But they also need to be held accountable. The reality is most are likely on drugs. That’s not stereotyping it’s again a fact they’re studying and finding in these ODS. The usual progression of people living in ODS goes something like poor background, high chance of sexual or physical abuse in childhood, mental disorders, etc. leading to eventual drug usage. Drug usage gets out of control and eventually lose job, place of residence, burn all bridges couch surfing and eventually end up on the street. Drug usage worsens as individual has no money because it solves 2 problems: 1) what will you do with your time 2) what will you eat? Hard to be hungry on amphetamines or opioids. 

Where the problem gets complicated is the solution most often offered is just give them things and they’ll be better. This is the liberal mindset, but it leaves out the portion where they need to be given things AND held accountable to have a job, stay clean and in general make good life decisions. The other mindset is they made the choice and their proverbial bed, so they can either pull themselves up or fuck em. This is the more conservative perspective. The problem is when you’re in ODS and hooked on these crazier drugs, they really fuck with your cognitive abilities. So the chance of boot strapping your way out of an intense drug addiction is like next to nill.

The last problem is the police and the justice system in general. With all the push back on police they really don’t need the PR of picking on bums, particularly of minority descent. But that means the consequences for the ODS actions aren’t checked either. Furthermore, if the cops do in fact arrest someone in ODS likely on drug charges, they’re charged as felons and just totally fucked. We have shit diversion problems because echoes of Tricky Dicky (Richard Nixon) and Regan’s war on drugs makes all this shit way too illegal. Using drugs in public should be a slap on the wrist and cause to put you into intense drug diversion program and therapy. If you use and live on the street you should be arrested and *charged with a misdemeanor* where you have to go in front of a judge with your family (if any exists) and try to do better. 

But we can’t solve any of this because we can’t even frame the narrative around the discussion or problem correctly in the first place.

If I’ve lost you I assume it’s cuz you’re too boot strappy to offer aid or too empathic to hold accountable. Cheers 🍻",39,2022-09-13 22:06:37 UTC

Yet I never left litter anywhere, disrespected anyone, asked for handout, or caused as much as an eyesore with my camp. It is a horribly difficult way to live, but it's easy to be respectful.

Because It's a choice for most. Look what happens when you see those viral videos of people giving the homeless a bunch of money. They almost 100% of the time waste it.. Or get worse. Addiction is easily the cause of 75% of the homeless population. If not more. We can't ignore the addicts. It's a mental illness in its own right. But I'm telling you that you cannot help an addict who doesn't want to quit. The only solution is to consolidate it into designated trailer parks, camps, or apartments like we always have. More ghettos. There are some nice camps out in California that cost millions to run annually but there will never be enough. They need to be where everything is (especially the drugs) because they don't have transportation. Otherwise I'd say move them out where there's cheap land in the country. The tax increase may be worth it to make some kind of camp in a city like ours. But it's still just a bandaid.

Even then people can’t afford the 30% of their income plus utilities plus food and necessary item. There are charities all around that help with those things but also require applications and meetings all around town. It becomes a full time job just to be able to afford a place to live.

2) better access to mental health services - I know out city does have services but it still isn’t enough. So many homeless have mental health issues that are not well controlled. Many who have had help have meds are constantly stolen and then they once again are without meds. Others need to work with mental health professionals to simply work through the trams they have been though. 

3) jobs- it sounds easy but is far from it. Many have difficulty even applying for jobs now that applications are primarily online. In addition it is difficult to apply without a primary address and phone number. Even if they get through to an interview it usually doesn’t present well to come in old gross clothes and dirty. Having a place to clean up and get interview clothes is important. Again, there are some charities that help out but they need to know about them and often the hours are not consistent.


I wish the city could start a tiny house initiative that some other countries have done. They build very simple/utilitarian tiny houses and rent is free. There are conditions to living there but in general they are pretty mild. Usually it is something like: You have to maintain your tiny house. You have to go to mental health appointment.

1. It costs less to house a homeless person and provide them with a caseworker than it does to pay for the average cost if they remain homeless (in unpaid medical bills, court expenses, policing, etc.). So, it is economically more viable to support the homeless community even if they don’t find employment or stay clean or “make good life decisions”. 

Source: Central Florida Commission on Homelessness, referenced in this article (https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/2014/5/30/5764096/homeless-shelter-housing-help-solutions).

2. The “in general make good life decisions” requirement for helping homeless people is problematic because everyone else has a different metric for what a good life decision is. By allowing these sort of things to make their way into legal policy we would be disqualifying homeless people from aid for often times arbitrary reasons. Means or ability testing for government aid has always been wildly problematic and unsuccessful. Just look at people on Medicaid who are unable to take better paying jobs because they would loose their health insurance and become financially ruined. Again, housing homeless people saves you money even if they don’t “clean up their act,” so by denying homes to homeless people who can’t work or won’t make the decisions you like you are actually spending money to make their lives worse just because you don’t like their life choices.

3. Painting all homeless people as drug addicted mental health patients is not fair to those who don’t have substance abuse or mental health issues and misrepresents the homeless community. About 30% of homeless people have mental health conditions and about 50% of homeless people have substance abuse problems. While this is higher than the percentages for non-homeless people this is not representative of all homeless people. Calling homeless communities open drug scenes doesn’t help the problem or conform to the reality of the situation. 

Source: Us Department of Housing and Urban development’s 2010 Annual Homelessness assessment report to Congress.

4. While mental health is seriously underfunded in the US painting this as primarily a mental health issue is not representative of the homeless community. 70% of homeless people do not have serious mental illnesses. This won’t be fixed by approaching it as a mental health issue.

5. There seems to be a misconception that Homeless people don’t work or can’t work. Over half of sheltered homeless people and 40% of unsheltered homeless people have formal employment. It just isn’t enough to afford rising housing costs.

6. It seems wildly unfair to charge homeless people with a greater crime for drug use than a housed person because of their living situation. I agree that drug use should be decriminalized and while making drug use a misdemeanor would be better than a felony I don’t see how charging anyone for non-violent drug crimes helps anyone.

I do want to ask a couple of follow up questions: 

1. What is your solution for homeless people that are unable to meet your standards? Do you want them to be left on the street to freeze, starve or die of heat exhaustion? 

2. Is the goal of homeless aid to better the public wellbeing or is to hold people accountable for their actions?",3,2022-09-14 14:17:30 UTC

The problem with homelessness is people who wish the problem were simpler to solve then it is. Like the people who comment that we should just give free homes away. First of all, they don’t exist. Second of all, there is no federal or state or local program to just straight up - give away houses, pay their utility bills, and maintain their houses forever. And lastly - it isn’t just a home that is needed, it is utility costs, lawn maintenance, property taxes - all things that add up. It isn’t just a one time lump sum of cash and the problem disappears.

It’s also painting broad strokes based on one study done in 2010 before the homeless problem really escalated. So citing one study and applying that to the current situation, when more recent studies of the actual encampments particularly San Francisco’s and LA are showing much higher rates of drug usage than you’re saying, seems a little misguided.

I appreciate the thoroughness of your response, but I just disagree with a lot of what you’re saying.

1) I agree we need to house them and I understand it costs more in all the unpaid expenses, policing, etc. I agree where it’s more economically viable. I disagree that it’s better for a person to just give them things and expect that to make them better. That just goes against everything I believe and know to be true about human nature. So I guess we agree to disagree. I think if they can’t participate to a set standard of behavior, then they’re on their own and we eat the costs as a society.

2) Again giving people things with no consequences doesn’t solve their problems. A good benchmark is don’t be using, or be in a diversion program if you are, and don’t conduct criminal behavior. Not exactly the highest bar to clear…

3) Disagree that your study is accurately representing the current problem

4) Same as 3 except that I think giving people access to psychological services helps even if you’re not clinically mentally ill. Caseworkers, psychologists and physiatrists are really just people trying to understand people and help give them the tools to better their life. Not really sure why you’d be advocating for less help given the premise of the rest of your arguments.

5) location, location, location. Sure they might work, but can’t afford housing? Yeah, in the most expensive parts of the country where the homeless populations are largest. It’s actually quite affordable when you move out of those areas. Sometimes even an hour or two.

6) what would you do then? Have shooting up on the street amount to a parking ticket that’ll never be paid? The whole point of a misdemeanor is to have it be of consequence enough that the state can intervene and put them into a diversion program without having a felonies on their record that’ll prevent them from ever having full rights and access in our society.

As for your question:

1) I don’t think a one and done system is what I’m advocating for. I know enough people who have recovered or did not recover from drug problems to know the road to recovery isn’t always a linear progression. There’s a reason these people are on the street, and it’s not easy to undo all those decisions overnight without any slip ups. But yes, if you go through a program for idk pick a number, say 6 months, and you’re still using, or committing crime, or just in general not making any effort whatsoever to try to meet whatever benchmarks are set forth by professional caseworkers, then I’m sorry but you don’t get free things. Unless these people can prove they are literally mentally insane and threat to society, it’s not the states responsibility to solve everyone’s problems, especially people who just don’t want to participate in society.

2) the goal is obviously to better public being via holding people accountable. It’s not an either or, I believe the way to better public good is to give them support and hold accountable.",2,2022-09-14 17:00:12 UTC

All I'll say is the war on drugs was created to divide and increase difficulty for the impoverished. Civil rights were empowering the black community and getting them more rights in the 60s. So they flooded the streets with heroin and crack into the 80s then Regan created the war on drugs to put them in jail for absurd sentences. 25-life for a little weed. They're still in there by the way. Obama started pardoning some of them finally. The irony of someone serving a sentence for a drug that's now legal. Those people in California, Colorado, michgan aren't pardoned just from the law change, though they should be. So yeah that's your war on drugs in a nutshell. If that's not convincing to you do some research. Stats don't lie. Czech, Portugal, Switzerland, Netherlands. Insane drops in crime and homelessness. And that's what this thread is discussing, correct?

And it makes perfect sense. The homeless and addiction problem has nothing to do with the legalization of weed so let's get that straight. It stems from the opiate epidemic sparked from the oxy contin boom in the early 2000s. Perdu pharma falsified documents about addiction statistics and incentivised doctors to over prescribe. Then when they got caught and took it away in 2008/2010 everyone went to heroin. The 3 billion dollar settlement against Perdue pharma only recently finished. And what a joke that was. Just a slap on the wrist and money allocation went back into other big pharma companies. Anyway, after that then China flooded the dark web with fentanyl and now sells the precursors to the cartel sinc they're better at importing. You legalize it, there goes the black market. There goes the cartel. There goes their numbers since they don't have the money to support the gang. Take away their numbers and the human trafficking and gang wars decrease. That on top of the increase in tax dollars and safe control of the harder drugs. Addicts getting safe drugs without the risk of overdosing. I'm not suggesting they put crack on the store shelves. But a safe and legal medical facility (like they've done in Vancouver as well) to safely get and use clean drugs. These facilities have rules in order to get access to them. And people follow rules to get their drugs. Unlike Methadone clinics and buprenoprphine which isn't effective on a large scale. It does not kill cravings and its harder to get off of. You don't give cake to someone who wants pie. They'll still want the pie. Stupid analogy but whatever. It's true. You get people into these facilities and stop throwing then in jail, you get a decrease in crime, overdoses, incarceration, and increase tax dollars. More tax dollars, more facilities to help the homeless and more resources to PROPERLY battle the addiction epidemic. What we have now doesn't work. It never has. It only fuels division. The thing they didn't plan on is now the rich white kids are homeless addicts too. I've been out in the streets. I fortunately got out. But I know what works and what doesn't. If you don't believe me, then do your research on what the other countries have done.",5,2022-09-14 09:48:26 UTC

Additionally, not housing the homeless costs money in the form of unpaid medical bills and the costs of running prisons (homeless people are much more likely to end up in prison and actually sometimes commit crimes specifically to go to prison so they are housed and fed). Additionally, there are 33 empty properties in the US for each homeless person. While these homes may not be in the same areas as homeless populations are it demonstrates just how solvable this problem is.

While one of the sources I choose was a national report to congress from 2010, the other was much more recent (2019) and in the context of long term problems like homelessness 10 years isn’t that long ago. Additionally, the sources I choose are from reliable government run studies both nationally and focused on an individual state. Keep in mind that large studies like this are done with years in between them. We only do a nation census every 10 years because gathering large amounts of data on a national scale is difficult.

In contrast the one source that you share “San Fransicko” has a very clear bias. First, one of the self proclaimed goals of the books is to show “How and why,” he wonders, “do progressives ruin cities?” (Quote taken from the New York Times review of the book, link at the bottom). This is a pretty clear political bias. Additionally, he focuses on one city which has not conformed to national homelessness trends (while homelessness number have fallen nationally they have risen in San Fransisco). This seems like much shakier ground to stand to base your opinion of all homeless people nationally and solutions to the homelessness problem on.

In response to numbered replies:

1. So, just to be clear, you recognize that it is cheaper to house the homeless than it is to leave them unhoused, but you believe we should leave some people homeless for their own good? Giving shelter to someone who is homeless makes their life significantly better. These are people with no shelter is winter, unreliable food and water sources and no permanent address for receiving mail or to list on job applications. Giving them shelter, food and water solves these problems in a way that no behavioral incentives will. Again, it costs money to withhold these thing, which are essential to human life, from these people, but you want to just because it goes against what you specifically think about human nature. Human nature requires food, water and shelter before anything else which you, by your own admission, would pay to withhold from people “for their own good”.

2. This seems at direct odd with some of your original claims. You said in your first post that it can be impossible for homeless people to get off drugs, yet you require them to be off drugs or actively trying to get off drugs in order to help them. This “not a high bar to climb” was presented as extremely difficult in your original post.

3 & 4. I believe that the sources I have shared which are national and statewide run investigations into homelessness present a much clearer picture of the problem than the source you shared. Additionally, homelessness numbers have actually dropped nationwide since 2010 by around 20%, so again your source is less representative of the issue.

I am not advocating against improved mental health or drug abuse treatment. I am saying that you are misrepresenting the situation. While improved mental health and drug programs would help the situation there are also other causes of homelessness and it isn’t the fix you believe it to be.

5. Suggesting that homeless people simply need to move is not a reasonable fix. If they are struggling to survive how do you expect them to move to a new city and leave behind everything they know? How do you expect them to find new employment in more rural areas when they have no home address and there are significantly less job opportunities? How do you expect them to afford transportation?

6. I was pointing out how unfair it is to give different penalties for a crime based on housing situations. Public using should still be illegal, but basing the charge on the housing situation isn’t a fair position. If a homeless person uses in a private location (safe injection site, friends home, etc.) they shouldn’t be punished for it just because they are homeless. Let me know if I have misinterpreted your position here.

Replying to the question responses:

1. The statement “there is a reason these people are on the streets” sheds a lot of light on your opinion of homeless people. Many people become homeless because of medical debt or being laid off or having ptsd from being in the military. Many people are homeless because they were unlucky and didn’t have a family to support them. And many are homeless because their parent kicked them out of their home. It’s not always bad decisions. Many homeless develop their drug habit in response to their situation instead of it causing their homelessness in the first place. 

It really seems like you believe that some people are worthy of saving and some people should just roll over and die. This attitude doesn’t solve the homeless problem because some people believe “there is a reason these people are on the streets” and that they deserve to stay there. 

Additionally, you admit that it saves us money to house people even if they nothing to better their situation for themselves. Doesn’t this seem like the exact kind of action the state is supposed to take for betterment of everyone. Saving us money and helping the downtrodden.

2. Holding people accountable for their actions isn’t the solution to homelessness. They are homeless in the first place because they have been held accountable for their actions, the actions of others or simply being unlucky. In your original post you said that believing people could just pull themselves up by their bootstraps is not a reasonable position. Why has your stance changed?",2,2022-09-14 18:52:08 UTC

* When people don't have housing, it's much harder for them to actually spend time finding a steady job or other source of income

You can see evidence of this on an individual scale in those who have even just small levels of distressing anxiety, depression, adhd/add, and some compulsive disorders. When your brain is functioning in survival mode, its primary focus is on what it needs to do in order to keep you alive and as stable as you need to be to remain so.

When people come out of their depressive episodes, they often wonder how they let themselves and/or their environment ""get to such a point. "" Or you may see someone with adhd experiencing high stress who simply cannot keep their space clean, stick to one task or priority, and the stacks of ""organized chaos"" begin to accumulate before they're beyond overwhelmed, frustrated, and giving up. Or maybe there's an individual grieving the recent loss of a loved one who suffers from a compulsive disorder like dermatillomania that you see with many more visible scars and pick marks than usual - or you stop seeing them at all because of the stigma and shame that surrounds their disorder...

All I'm trying to say is that, yes of course, we all want nice clean public areas to enjoy together in an ideal world.

The temporarily homeless, the people who lost a job, got divorced, had to leave a horrible situation, or kicked out of their housing are comparatively VERY EASY to get off the streets, their brains work, and the system, as crappy as it is, gets them into a home.

  
The real problem is the people who have brains that just don't work either due to addiction, mental illness, or sadly both.  

Ansognosia prevents these people from even realizing just how badly their brains don't work, and then you get the (hopefully) well intentioned people who idiotically promote laws that ""allow"" people with horrible mental issues the ""right"" to sleep on the ground, in parks, under overpasses, under the misguided belief that it's their ""choice"" to do so, rather than their illness (addiction or mental illness) that is compelling them to die.

People with the ideology that sees immigrants as just receiving government handouts, or that all homeless are drug addicts, and so on would be seen as so extreme that it would potentially require institutionalization rather than just being a slightly right leaning political view.

You aren't individually responsible for a culture that breeds people like Trump and his followers, but when you buy into everything Alex Jones pushes and put people like that in power, you do bare a small amount of responsibility.

Mass propaganda and the reduction of investment into education and infrastructure in favor of increased military, police, and incarceration spending as well as the privatization of these things are some of the main causes of our current situation.

Without social programs to help people keep shelter, our streets would be flooded with the unhoused. 

With rent and real estate pricing continuing to sky rocket, families need help just to stay afloat. It's not like it was 10-15 years ago when a 1bd apartment was around 500, high end 3 BD apartments didn't go above 1k. Now, 1 bedrooms hoover around 1k and 3 bedrooms are closer to 2k. 

People as a whole need better wages. This isn't the 60s and 70s where the chances of upward mobility sky rocketed for a lot of families. Instead, it's reversed and the economically disparaged barley have enough money to cover the necessities. 

Yet the government thinks they can step in, and tell women and girls that they should have children they can't perhaps afford. Then they get mad when they have to rely on the state or federal government to help them survive. 

When did we stop caring about people? Not everyone who is unhoused made the decision that this is how they wanted to live their lives. Not everyone who's financially disparaged asked for it either. It literally comes down to corporate greed and the government's failure to protect the backbone of this country's workforce. 

Yet we punish and abuse the working class and the impoverished by keeping them in the financial bracket they were born into, without any chance of upward mobility. 

There isn't a simple solution. But there has to be a way to stop the never ending circle of poverty. I'm tired of hearing boomers tell people to find better employment, or you should've made better life choices. Especially when they had their lifestyles handed to them on a silver platter, stripping away the chances of those who were born after them from attaining the same chances of upward mobility. 

Kalamazoo wouldn't have the be the hub, if other states would have the capacity to help their own citizens more. 

Have a heart, heaven forbid you have to donate plasma to pay your electric bill, or even for a decent meal for you and your family. Or take a serving job where you are forced to split tips with the team, despite the fact that you were the ones who waited on the people who tipped nicely.

Is it education...is it infrastructure?  I agree these would be the two most nessasary  and beneficial places to use tax money... but to negate the importance of law enforcement is to contradict the desire or a more civil society. It's unfortunate but true. The cities where funding has been cut and forces reduced have seen insane increases in crime....and the courts who hold the same sentiment about incarceration are letting violent theives back on the street in no time at all. I've experienced and seen this first hand. Maybe it will take, God forbid, such a crime to affect you directly before you might agree. Then you'll have wished there was another police officer on duty who may have helped sooner, or wish the court would have kept that criminal behind bars for another 6 months because not even 5 months after being let go he did something drastic to someone you care about. I agree there are certain ""crimes"" that should absolutely have the consequences altered to something less harsh then being incarcerated for extend3d periods of time, but not for crime across the board like what is happening in left ran cities.
And the amount of taxation we are subject to is absolutley ridiculous...Look at retirement accounts in which a majority of them has your money taxed prior to going in one, and then of course taxed again when it's time to take it out... not to mention you're forced to keep it in the account unless you want to suffer high fees for just wanting or needing to use your own money. That sounds like theft by use of an entities power over an individual. Something like the mob. Especially when you consider how much government personnel wages have increased over the recent years. Maybe if most of the Mr. and Mrs. HouseReps weren't making high 6, or up to 7 figures a year, taxes could be lowered and more could be used for things that would benefit all the folks whose money is being used for all these things in the first place...like their children's education, or the roads they drive on to their place of work, where they have to go to make sure they are giving the government  their ""fair"" share....
And also...not all, but a good majority of the homeless are drug addicts who do not work, and do not want to utilize help that people are already kindly offering them. That's reality, not biased thinking by a certain group of people. Only a naive idiot would say otherwise... It may not be someone's fault they ended up homeless because of uncontrollable or overbearing circumstances they endured...but there's a reason a person stays in that position for an extended period of time...and that is their choice.. if nothing else there are shelters they could stay in. But many don't want to abide to the structure and requirements put in place at the shelters. They would rather be on the street doing what they do. That is what it is.

In your life, who do you know who isn't an addict or mentally ill that if their home burned down today, and they had no insurance, doesn't have a friend or family member to take them in for a few weeks while they get stuff in order?

Even those who are jobless but capable of working should be looked at as long term investments rather than viewed as immediate on a loss/gain scale. Reducing or elimination homelessness, treating drug and alcohol addictions, and so on may take months or years, but those capable of gainful employment will then reenter the workforce and begin paying taxes. This in turn allows for a positive net cycle of increased investment into social welfare leading to increased tax revenue.

I hate the fact that we just look at another human being and have to assign value to their existence, but that's the world we live in. That is also my biggest issue with conservatives no matter how close to center they are, they are very short sighted.

People sleeping next to the tiniest tree on the shoulder of Michigan ave in front of businesses just looking for shade, people laying in piles of their belongings in garbage bags in the middle on the sidewalk with 5 or 6 other people, dozens of people missing limbs or asleep in their wheelchairs, so many people.

One in particular was a hobo (his preferred term, I’m not using it as a pejorative) who spent his 20s and 30s hopping trains around the southwest and northwest. In his 40s came this way as his brother had moved to Ohio and was sick. He bounced around the Midwest for a few years eventually hitting Kalamazoo.  This was in ‘96. I met him in 2005 I believe. 

He told me that there were decent support structures around here if you weren’t a degenerate and he could always find enough work to get by. He didn’t plan on staying here but before he knew it 8 years had passed. He was close enough to get down and see his brother fairly quickly when he wanted to and back.  He was getting older and this felt like a good spot.

He also told me that he knew about Kalamazoo before leaving the west coast from other hobos talking about it. I believe it’s a known supportive community amongst the crowd from my discussions with him.",20,2024-11-21 23:39:37 UTC

My personal anecdotes:   
  
1. Attending a housing conference in Portland OR in 2013 and meeting a stranger from Wisconsin. Upon me telling him where I'm from, he said that they send their unsolvable worst cases here on the train with one way tickets. This is not a hearsay story. This was a stranger who directly told me he did this in his line of work. He also said it was a common practice. 

2. Witnessing local activists reach out to homeless people elsewhere in the state to come to Kalamazoo for encampments. Again, not hearsay. I personally witnessed this happen, though I could not speak to how common or prevalent it was.

It’s certainly an oft repeated narrative based on anecdotes that are repeated among people, but this is also a narrative that virtually every other city tells about themselves.

The research done in other places has shown that the majority of people experiencing homelessness in a given city are from the region (from that city and the surrounding suburbs, exurbs, and/or rural areas) but there are always some portion who migrate to that city because they either had family or some other connection to the city that led them to hope things would be better there or because they heard there were more resources/opportunities. Keep in mind, that’s one of the biggest reasons people with more economic means move too! 

Many people having a hard time in one place are going to migrate to different places to try to start fresh. Most of them have enough to get housing in that new city, so we don’t think of those moves in the same way.

The other thing that I think is rarely considered is that some people are also leaving the city, but they are never considered. People get those one way bus tickets going out of the city too. What is the net population shift? I don’t pretend to know.

The fallacy that really pisses me off is that a rise in the number of people experiencing homelessness in Kalamazoo is just more people coming from out of town. Homelessness is on the rise across most of the country for a number of factors (the biggest of which is housing affordability). Saying the PIT went up, ergo they all just came on the bus, is just stupid.",6,2024-11-21 23:39:02 UTC

Bigger cities have better resources and a much better chance at having a shelter. Public transportation is a big one. Not a whole lot of great city bus lines on this side either.

BC closed and is trying to find funding to stay open. Kalamazoo has the Gospel Mission. The YWCA is not a homeless shelter, you can't just walk in and ask to be there. Holland has one shelter. Grand Haven & South Haven don't have shelters. There's Keystone Place in Three Rivers, the Decatur family shelter, then Jackson and Lansing. That is not a lot of shelter, of course they flock here. 

Lastly, if one mission is done with you. Yes they will bus you. This doesn't mean they are the worst homeless person ever, it could also mean that that person wasn't of use to that Mission. Gateway & Mel Trotter expect the residents to work for the mission in some capacity. If you can't work with minimal accommodations, for free, then you may not be a fit for their program. If you're not banking SSI in the Missions account, allowing them to nickel & dime you with fees, you may not be a fit for their program.

However, I'm making an exception because you've basically created a bullet point presentation and I \*do\* have thoughts about each one.  In penance, despite my disagreement with you, I've up voted your post.  Anyway, here's my responses:

  
\>Man fuck yall.

\>You guys didn't even read the article. You just left a comment hating on people who literally don't have a warm place to sleep.



I'll do these two together, because IF you were correct about the second part, the first part would be an understandable position to take.  That said, I don't think anyone here is hating on the homeless, they generally want the people to get help, even if they don't know the best way for that to be done.

\>If you are so aware of the homeless why don't you help them?

  
This goes back to your definition of help.  We can feed them and we can offer them beds, but that is a short term solution that will will never resolve the problem.  I am with you, 100%, that we need to make sure people have food and shelter, the form that help takes though MUST include a plan to actually help these people long term.



\>You can donate to the resources mentioned in the article.

  
Yes!!! But those donations pale in comparison to the value of applying political pressure to actually solve the problems of mental illness and addiction.  Despite what many people here may believe, the overwhelming majority of the homeless are addicts and/or mentally ill.  MOST of these people can be brought to a level where they can function in society, but it will require nonconsensual custodial activity that will benefit them, but will also be met with resistance from the A(L)CLU and local hand wringers whining about ""it's their choice to do drugs and not treat their mental illness"".

\>Don't have the money?

\>Volunteer. Take your family to the food bank and volunteer this Thanksgiving



I would encourage people to volunteer, and while Thanksgiving is important, a better message would be to call and ask the local shelters what day or days they actually need the help, rather than end up with more volunteers on a specific holiday and nobody during the rest of the year.

\> Yall need to do some reflecting.

The problem is that we don’t have a coordinated effort that addresses the things that cause homelessness, like substance abuse, transportation, mental health, jobs, etc. (Yes, I know those things exist here. Coordinated efforts look totally different than just having services.)

If you want a local example of what effective service delivery would look like, look at the Rickman. The residents there are at high risk of being homeless; most have been homeless in the past. In order to live there they have to meet criteria: be engaged in authorized services including case management and meet standards for compliance with the rules in the building. With all of the homelessness, crime and drugs around in proximity to that place, they have not a ton of problems with it and their residents stay housed there because there are coordinated efforts to keep them safe, supported, and housed. There is a TON of help in place to help them meet their needs and support their safe housing. The services are what keep them housed, not the buildings that they live in. 

Those supports and services are scalable, but they need to be coordinated in order to be effective. That is a totally different issue than housing and can’t reasonably be implemented at the service delivery level.

The issue is wether or not you feel that any of the homeless in Kalamazoo have any responsibility within their own lives. Free, unconditional housing does not tackle the negative behavior that leads to homelessness in the first place and poverty being a trap cannot be solely blamed for this issue. I personally know at least one person in Kalamazoo that was a literal slave in Dubai and is now a prominent business owner in the area. There needs to be carrots and sticks in place. It is immoral to allow these camps to continue, and that means making it illegal to camp on public property inside the county outside of designated camp grounds. People are not flourishing in these camps and there has been violence and death. Not to mention the sanitary conditions or littering. People overdosing and living an addicts life in squalor is not preferable to jailing. What we also need in conjunction with these measures are options. We can 100% offer opportunities to stay in shelters as opposed to jailing. To then transition to some form of independent subsidized housing, people need to be required to make positive changes in their lives, such as sobriety. Offering free housing without enforcing any type of conditionality will just create new issues. Altruism can become pathological, and you can destroy peoples lives by offering them too much. Michael Shellenberger just wrote a book called “San Fran sicko” about this very subject and it highlights how endless compassion isn’t the answer.

But when I try to politely get a seemingly mentally ill individual on the street to leave me alone, for example, by saying ""I have lunch plans and I have to go, but nice meeting you"" I was followed as far as 3 miles and had to text a friend to come get me cause I didn't want to lead the man back to my house.

While I could pick them up as early as I'd like, some times 4:30 if we had concrete at 6 as I'm the owner and have to be there before all my other guys if they're riding with me, I've got to leave early to get then, and get to the job.

It's tricky. This blog is interesting and talked about it in san fransisco, and I think there's some important distinctions. 

>Some thoughts below. My background: SF Bay Area resident for 20 years, frequent visitor for 10 years before that. Spent 3-4 years from 1998-2003 doing weekly food distribution to homeless in southern California.  
>  
>There are (at least) three ""sub-classes"" of homeless and confusing or conflating them results in total confusion regarding solutions.  
>  
>A. Subclass A are the ""lifestyle homeless"". Vagabonds, drifters, gutter punks, street musicians, beach bums, craft stall vendors, ""van lifers"". A number of these folks I know by name, and consider to be friends. They could hold straight jobs in theory, and often come from more conventional backgrounds. The tradeoffs inherent in living the straight-and-narrow are too much, and they cannot or will not do it. Sometimes drugs and mental illness are an issue, but not overwhelmingly so.  
>  
>B. Subclass B are the ""down on their luck homeless"". Living in car, van, or RV temporarily due to job loss, bills, bad luck, or poor choices coupled to above. Will actively seek out shelter, come to social services and adhere to plans to improve the situation. Aiming to get back on their feet. Overwhelmingly working class and not happy or proud of their current condition.  
>  
>C. Subclass C are the ""wretched homeless"". Sorry about the moniker but it fits. Extreme mental illness or drug addiction. Limited ability or agency. Suffering in many dimensions. Selling body for drugs. Crime and violence -- both perpetrators and victims. Passed out on street in own fluids. These cases are extremely sad, and my heart breaks for them. A test: if you ask them their name or their story, you most often cannot get any kind of comprehensible reply.  
>  
>The wretched homeless are the ones that are most obvious in many ways, and seemingly what the book focuses on. They will not be helped by marginal changes in housing markets: rents dropping from $1500/mo to $1250/mo are not their issue. On the other hand, the ""down on their luck"" \*WILL\* be helped, and mightily so, by more affordable housing and/or social programs. NIMBY and 30 years of working class job offshoring are reasonable causes.  
>  
>Class C cannot be divorced, in any way, from changes in mental health policies, nor from the flood of ever-stronger drugs in the last decade. Drug induced psychosis and/or willingness to do almost anything for the next hit create a massive hole that is very very very hard to pull out of. Many (most?) die in that condition. Jail seems to be the only circuit breaker we have in the current system, and it does a poor job of interrupting the cycle.  
>  
>In the 30 years of my experience, the problem in SF Bay has gotten much worse. Some areas have improved (as I recall Mission district was very intense with heroin on the street in the 90s). Both classes B and C seem to be much larger overall.  
>  
>A major concern is preventing lifestyle and down-on-their-luck from becoming wretched. That is, how can we stop class A and B from becoming class C? Another major concern is tailoring programs and help to fit the person. A wretched homeless selling their body and dignity for the next hit is NOT going to fill out your paperwork, and will scare or harm others in a shelter.  
>  
>I think this review is too hard on Shellenberger. He seems to grasp realities of the problem that are glossed over by the homeless-industrial-complex.

Good question though. I moved here from Maryland specifically because it is so much more affordable here. I make the same wages I did in Maryland, and can afford much more here in Michigan.

It's simple math. The cost of living is higher than the amount a worker is compensated for their labor. Homeless people are not villains. They are people who need help and we refuse (as a society) to help them. 

Then some people have the nerve to blame the few people who do bother to help (Kzoo Gospel Mission) for causing the problem. Shame on you.

The answer is affordable housing and a living wage.

We should start with banning corporations from owning housing and creating artificial scarcity to drive up the cost of rent. 

We should also demand that any employer be required to pay an actual living wage for any work that is done at their business.

Homeless people leave areas where they don't have resources survive like a place to panhandle, a homeless shelter, budlings to use as shelter, etc. Also, other counties, cities and states do make homelessness more difficult with structures designed to harm them or benches with spikes, etc. Homeless people go where they can survive, that is why they don't go out into the country, suburbs or Republican counties in general.

I think another factor is that there are simply more jobs opportunities in high-cost of living areas, so it's a little easier to eek by. Whereas Kalamazoo, while not economically depressed, simply has few jobs on the whole available.

Also, there really is no reason for anyone to sleep on the street.  Especially in the winter.   There are plenty of available beds at the Gospel Mission and other shelters.

Let's assume $15 because I don't straw man. 

At a 15% tax rate for this low income the $2400 take home pay becomes $2050. A 3 bed house in the vine rents for $1600, assume $1900 with utilities. That is $633. 

$2050-$633 = $1377. 
Looking online, self provided healthcare is running about $600/ month in 2023, leaving $777 for personal expenses, or $25 per day, or $8.35 per meal. 

Is this an amazing life? Not quite. Could a person of sound mind probably up that to wage to $18 with some job hunting? Probably. There is another $3*160 = $480 per month of income. 

We live in a fairly affordable city. I think childcare, job training for mobility, and affordable healthcare are key issues to tackle. 

I think ""of sound mental health"" is a major issue for these vulnerable communities and probably a good start to tackle the problem. Affordable housing for those who want to buy is also very important.... which comes from adequate housing supply built by skilled labor.

What’s up with the insane increase in homeless people over the past 5-10 years here?,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/kzoo/comments/15sur08/whats_up_with_the_insane_increase_in_homeless/,2023-08-16 16:32:35 UTC,"Comparing minimum wage against the average (Can you clarify that this is statistical mean?) cost of a 1 bedroom is too problematic. This is poor methodology. Average income should be compared to average cost of a 1 bedroom unit. Minimum wage should be compared to minimum cost of a 1 bedroom unit, or some well-defined surrogate such as the 5th percentile. 


Census.gov provides the Kalamazoo County 2017-2027 medians for yearly household income, per capita income, selected monthly owner costs, gross rent as $61,739, $34,928, $560-1389, and $891, respectively. People earning $20,000 (approx. min. wage), $34,928, and $61,739/yr should not be targeting the same housing expenses. 

What separates me from a homeless person are circumstances and decisions. Both of which play equally critical roles.  
I lived with no savings off of $16,000 a year between 2017 and 2020. This was possible in part because I had an establishment upbringing (favorable circumstances), and in part because I sought housing that made sense for my income bracket (made good decisions). When thinking about poverty risk we can consider circumstances and decision making to be major points of entry. This is true everywhere; I think even though your fiscal analysis is flawed your conclusion is still mostly how I see it. It is a fiscal imbalance in the valuation of labor and cost of needs which precipitates poverty. This, however, does not provide OP with an answer to their question. 

OP is asking why the population is concentrating in Kalamazoo over a recent period of years. And the reason for that does indeed involve the services rendered to homeless people in Kalamazoo and the way the sheltered residents feel about homeless people.  They go where there are resources available and the culture is tolerate of their integration. Kalamazoo 100 % has an increasing homeless population because of the resources the homeless people can acquire and the sheltered residents lack of repulsion. Neither of these are necessarily bad things to have, but facts, they are indeed to blame for the uptick. 

This is not too different from the phenomena of homeless people migrating towards southern California. San Francisco is an incredible place to live, whether you’re housed or not. You can sleep outside nearly year round. The culture there is very tolerant of homelessness, and they have above average resources available there. This why they have a ton of homeless people. 

I’d argue that Kalamazoo is likely one of the best places for homeless people in the Midwest because of the exceptionally cheap housing opportunities. The lower the housing costs, the higher the likelihood that someone trying to get off the streets can actually make that leap. Any homeless person in the greater vicinity would be foolish not to come to Kalamazoo. It’s a real shot at getting up again. And if you fail, there are above average support mechanisms in place to float you along. 
I don’t get why people need to be so dogmatic and defensive about this. You made progressive changes to the society to help out the destitute and the destitute came for help. It’s not mass spectrometry in outer space, PCR based assay development, rocket science, or even accounting. You can be proud of the opportunities and outreach and still acknowledge that your efforts have second order effects that may someday require management.

Kalamazoo has lost a lot of it’s luster. So many other things to blame aside from the occasional homeless person IMO. But, the homeless population there has long included individuals who harm a portion of our economy by creating large amounts of discomfort in the shopping areas.  When individuals are roaming into restaurants and businesses to panhandle without some mechanism to disincentivize, you can expect to lose tourism. When homeless people follow you home in the dark and start demanding you feed them in your home, you will lose residents. Lose too much revenue, lose residents, lose too many residents, lose tax income and organizational support, lose those and you no longer can afford to assist the destitute people. The second order effects need to be balanced.


Once again, just want to clarify via illustration that there is no reason someone making minimum wage should be targeting something that costs over $1000 per month per bedroom. Kalamazoo is overflowing with listings like these:

Restrictive zoning is not what is holding back affordable housing in Kalamazoo.  


New construction affordable housing, in the private market, without government subsidies, doesn't exist. It's not possible to exist. The cost to build, even with the greatest economies of scale and building a large multi-unit made possible with no zoning problems, is simply too high. That's just the math of it. You can't build a new building and charge affordable rents.   


So, new affordable housing only exists with subsidies. Local government, HUD, MSHDA, or Low Income Housing Tax Credits. These sources are all limited, and only result in so many projects a year and most of those projects took 3-6 years to put together and finally get all of the gap financing needed to make SOME of the units affordable.

I've had multiple people tell me there are a lot of psychologically unstable and potentially violent people that will make their way into the shelters, and there's a very real fear of being assaulted or having your posessions stolen by other people. In that case, people feel safer on the streets.

One guy in particular told me he chooses to sleep along a street route outdoors frequented by KDPS police, and he feels safer knowing the police presence rolls by, compared to being in a shelter with limited staffing where he could get assaulted.

What I don't hear are solutions to the main issue, which is the lack of affordable housing in Kalamazoo. The city was donated 400 MILLION dollars that they are sitting on but then complain that it cost 18 million to build ONE affordable housing complex (Walnut and Park). There are so many abandoned buildings and facilities that could be torn down or repurposed to build affordable housing. Even if one building was efficiency apartments only would be a huge help. If people don't want encampments by their businesses, then again you could develop a piece of land that would allow for these people who chose to live there to live the way they want but in a place they don't have to worry about being evicted from.    


Going to the mission isn't an option for a lot of individuals and the mission isn't the end all be all. If you're transgendered, you will still be housed with your birthed sex and not the sex you identify as. If you're an individual you have no privacy and will stay in a room housed with several other individuals, which not only opens you up for sexual assault but also theft, illnesses, and other issues. If you do stay there, in the evenings you're expected to take part in bible study even if you're not Christian. Then you are to leave the building by 8am each day with no where to go.  These people who choose to live in encampments and refuse to go to the mission do so typically because of the prejudices they've faced there. Living in a tent may seem like a horrible thing to you, but to these individuals, it allows them privacy, safety, and the ability to have a place to be all day long if they choose. Also, many unhoused individuals have pets who are like family or have become a huge emotional support to them, what are they suppose to do with them? abandon them where they will either be in a shelter or euthanized?    


There isn't a solid way to fix this situation. It's not all one way or another, the city needs to approach it in a holistic manner and really start focusing on building up the community and not just downtown to earn more money.

Whenever I had visited they were keeping things tidy and making sure everyone ate, especially those who couldnt get out of their tent for medical reasons or they were quite elderly. They pooled their resources and helped one another. They seemed to be pretty close knit. I chatted with them for some time and there were a couple jerks like anywhere but the majority were so friendly and respectful. And they had bins, I cant recall if there were porta johns. But either way, there must be somewhere they can be in peace. Life is hard enough for them right now without having what precious things you can scrape together bulldozed to the ground multiple times. Many people worked also and had to walk a long ways to get to work. 

Idk. There must be a place in town for them to be, they need a place to exist where they can easily get to resources.  There has to be a vacant building that can be used or a vacant lot at the very least in town. We could all benefit from more jobs. Why not hire folks to be security, hire more social workers, hire more people to help these people. 

Even if the humanity aspect doesnt appeal to all, there has to be some tax incentives or grants out there to help. I know we got that 400m and I know it needs to be spread over 10 years. It might take more than we got but we could do something. Ask every business in town to put out a donation box, they often complain about the homeless community hurting business, so surely they want to help, have a special night at Wings Stadium and charge an extra ten to get in and let people post it all over social media. 

As for the issue of people coming from other cities, if we can help erase homelessness here or get close maybe we can lead the way for other citys to do the same s that they dont just ship out their own vulnerable citizens. We could do something big here. If not us, who? If not now, when?

Sorry for dragging on. People asked me today why I dont come up with a solution then? I have been thinking on it all day. It might not be the answer but its an idea and I am tossing it out there.

Yes our society has massively let them down and I want them housed as well.

But stop pretending you would be ok with a homeless camp near your house, there is rampant drug trading and usage in the open, lots of needles left around, plenty of prostitution and indecent exposure to the public. And lots and lots of violence.

We need to do better to get these peoole the help they need, because that's what they are, people. But it doesn't mean it's safe or ok for them to camp anywhere they want and essentially trash that area.

So yes, they can't live near public or private housing and businesses. Instead of trying to call people out for being uncomfortable about living near these camps. We need to be focusing our energy on providing more.

But more so on that point we need to get our neighboring cities to stop sending their homeless to us on the bus and start providing as much as kalamazoo does to the homeless.

We have a metric ton of shelters, kitchens and health programs to help these people. Not all of them take advantage of it and not all of them safely can interact with the people who run them.

The 2019 budget for Kalamazoo was like 250 million dollars. So 2020 or 2021 budget- with some inflation - is going to be like 300 million dollars. 

40mn is a great gift. With so many competing priorities; it is tough for city officials. Have you considered what it takes to “just have the government build some housing and hand the keys to homeless people”? Not only does the city need to find a neighborhood who will allow this (NIMBY), but the individual receiving the house will need to maintain the house until….their death. Many of these people do not have income. This means the city is not only on the hook for procuring land, construction labor, construction materials; but also the property taxes, utilities, maintenance, yard work, and repairs. The US government has a housing program to approach this issue - its the section 8 housing vouchers. 

Cities - especially smaller midwestern cities in the rust belt - are cash strapped. Thousands of miles of road to maintain, low population density everywhere, taxes that are too low - City of Kalamazoo is going to use that 400mn on the basic necessities that we’re already foregoing.",13,2021-10-14 16:30:33 UTC

It isn’t just costs related to housing that has to be considered; but also the costs related to mental health, physical health, transportation, food & nutrition, and…well - everything that you or I work to pay for.

Everyone of these people have unique circumstances - some of them might claim they cannot work at all, or some of them might be able to work some, and some of them might be able to work - but still fall short of affording basic essentials. So the financial cost is….massive. I cannot imagine how to budget for this - especially at the local level. The initial construction costs could be the smallest - with the recurring costs being even larger.

All this to say - it is complicated. I don’t see many people with solutions. The easiest solution seems to be if Federal HUD department offers grants for (or otherwise subsidizes) section 8 housing. Then if the section 8 housing program was expanded, more people would be eligible. It is a system that appears to work. Naturally, it seems the easiest way to reduce homelessness, and provide housing - without the government having to massively increase taxes.

There is something to be said for how society treats its poor and homeless. Everything has gotten so.expensive; that doing anything - and trying to solve anything, seems to cost millions - tens of millions, hundreds of millions - and billions…in no time.

Cities, unlike the federal government, have to balance their budgets. Cities literally declare bankruptcy if they can’t service their debt. Underfunded pension liabilities, endless road maintenance costs - these issues are just massive. Not to mention all the aging infrastructure that isn’t a road (like bridges, water treatment plants, waste treatment plants, pump stations, water pipes).

This is yet another dilemma. Not only are people unwilling to take homeless people in to their own house, but they don't support housing them nextdoor, or in their neighborhood. Basically, anything that could pose a risk to their children, spouse, or housing value...is not going to be supported. 

People know what happens to the neighborhoods that invite project housing in. Everyone that is homeless is not a murderer, but a not insignificant percentage are involved in criminal activity - or undesirable activity. 

This argument is an attempt to seriously, and creatively think of the issue, and how we could address it. Where can we find a community of people willing to let homeless people without any income live in project style housing?

Like, literally how? Is this raising the federal income tax bracket?

The most reasonable, and most likely to be implemented idea I’ve heard (this idea can be applied nationally, and is not exclusive to Kalamazoo) is; expansion of section-8 housing vouchers + subsidies/grants/tax exemptions for developers building section-8 housing

Lumber is at record prices. Construction labor has never been more expensive. Capital goods are not becoming cheaper to produce. 

Inflation, input costs, and labor all add up to make an incredibly difficult housing situation for those making poverty wages, or recovering from bad choices in life. 

Housing prices in Kzoo have been relatively affordable (and still continue to be...when reviewing national averages), and outsourcing production of consumer goods to third world countries has hidden this housing problem. Your rent goes up $50; but....you can still buy a $59 smartphone, a ten pack of socks for $7, a big screen TV for $199, and so on. That hides the problem, until the problem becomes too large, that even consumer goods produced by people who make $2/day, in factories that have zero pollution control or waste disposal will only go so far. 

Then add in the fact that more and more Americans depend on these low-skill service industry jobs that pay $10-11/hr - and the housing crisis becomes a slow moving trainwreck. 

We either need to lower input costs, convince construction workers to work for free (sarcasm), convince construction workers to work for less (or....automate their jobs to lower labor costs), or increase the minimum wage.

The world is so flat in 2021, that tech workers hoping to make six figures are competing with citizens from Eastern Europe, India, and Baltic states - who will gladly work for $15k USD/yr. Manufacturing workers are competing with frontier economies that have zero regulations for child labor or pollution. HR staff are competing with Philippino workers. Philippino workers are competing with chat-bots / voice recognition call center software - which reduce the staff needed to support a brand. 

What a whirlwind of a conversation.... I will wrap it up and remark that I can't blame those who want quick/dirty (dumb) solutions, like trump who sought taking protectionism to another level.

> Yes I'm a Communist. That's not how communism works. Going to the homeless shelter and starting communism is illegal, and would result in the police showing up.

LIAR. You can go and give away your wealth at any point you want.  You just don't want to.  Feel free to show me any law that prohibits you from distributing the fruits of your labor to anyone you want.  

> No, I'm in favor of ideals that support basic human rights. Ideologies that suppress those rights like Nazism or Monarchism are invalid. Your statements on the homeless show otherwise, and your defense of capitalism and hostility towards Communism says you don't want your ideology to work for everyone.

Hahahahahahaha!  Communism is evil. Communists are either slaves or masters.  Want to point out where Communism has worked? I'm guessing you do want to, but there aren't any examples, so... maybe they've just been waiting for the right person to lead them.

>That's not a truth, in the slightest. Even the people who came up with that figure said it is inaccurate. Besides, even if it was accurate, you need to count your ideology which has killed billions upon billions.

You are living in a capitalist society.  You refuse to enact your core beliefs on even a micro scale because it would inconvenience you.  Look around, our poor are fat, have tvs, mobile phones, air conditioners, access to clean water, and the list goes on and on.


But again, I offer you the opportunity to prove me wrong. Simply share your belongings and earnings equally amongst those who have less than you for a year.  When, at the end of that year, you and they have produced the next microsoft/facebook/google, feel free to brag to me. I'll eat crow gladly.

From each according to their ability, to each according to their need.  You have the ability to fit, what, 5-10 homeless in your room. Get to it comrade, they need you.

They also need detox and psychological help, but you are strangely oblivious to the world in which you live.  

By Stalin's pubic beard!!! Go ask those at the shelters what the real problems are.  Housing isn't on the list.",1,2021-04-03 04:25:57 UTC

However, because you've taken the stance of someone having an agenda I'll respond. KGM received by way of donation, approximately 6 times the cost of their new construction on the expansion. The money is mostly gone. No real 'newer' programs have been implemented. The historic programs you referenced are non existent. There's a small, non funded discipleship program that is very loosely based on the 12 step tenets. So, while you may have ideals in your mind regarding the situation there and it's larger impact on homelessness in Kalamazoo,you're sadly uninformed. The director, however. Is driving a much newer vehicle. ( not talking about pastor Brown here) Most of the entrenched management seems to be driving better and dressing nicer. Frontline employees are in the same boat they always were. And the people who are supposed to be getting the help from the donations have seen almost no change in their prospects. 
You don't need to take my word for any of this, in fact I'm sure you won't. Doesn't change the fact that it's true. It's the thing about the truth it really doesn't care about anyone's opinions it just goes on being the truth.

That, by the way, is why I hold the line and call anyone who uses ""unhoused"" an idiot and unworthy of a conversation.

Junkies and the mentally ill make up 90% of the homeless population.  You cannot give them a home a d call it ""job done"".  They need to be treated and cared for around the clock until hopefully some (but sadly not a majority) will be able to function in society again with less supervision.

The next group is a collection of two groups, temporarily homeless who through circumstances (domestic violence, younger adult kicked out of family home, lost job and no family nearby, etc) and families that lost a breadwinner (loss of life, took off, ended up in prison) or the breadwinner lost their job and doesn't have many options.  

  
The second group is SOOOO EASY and CHEAP (comparatively) to help since that is what our systems are designed to do.  They're not drug addicts, they're not insane, and they have ID's and functioning brains.  The people you were dealing with in the past were the 90% who's brains don't work and can't be helped by simply putting a roof over their head because within a few months any accomodations they're given will be trashed if not outright burned down.

I will gladly support the plan to convert the hotel IF they focus on transitory homeless since they're the only ones that CAN be helped by this plan.

There IS a way to help the 90%, but until there is political will behind it, too many people will pretend that all , ""homeless"" fall into the second category rather than the first, and then act all surprised when the plans don't work.",4,2024-10-04 17:15:55 UTC

Look deeper to better understand what you are observing. 

You are using the term homeless to describe a group of people and concluding that all of the individuals in the group are the same AND that they are all victims of a system. There probably are some of these individuals who are good people who just had bad luck and insufficient support from their communities. There are also some who had lots of support and are now residing in places like the camps you’ve described. 

So how did everyone involved get to where they are today? And more importantly, and at the heart of what you are saying, how can we show empathy, compassion, and prevent unnecessary suffering?

Our community does a lot in an effort to help. People donate food, time, money, and other resources. Organizations offer shelter, clothing, food, and assistance that can enable individuals to not live outdoors and to also become financially independent. Some of the people living in the camps you described have accepted this help. Those are the success stories that get less attention. One of the leaders who manages the Ministry With Community kitchen that feeds the homeless will tell you that he was once homeless himself. He received help and is no longer homeless. So, there are actually some wins happening — it’s not all evil landlords and government oppressing helpless victims. 

One might say, do more of what works. Fund it, scale it up, “solve” this “problem.” There have been increases in community support. People in the community have stepped up and done more. Maybe we could get some smart people together who could develop a detailed plan and budget, they could include the “homeless” in the conversation — and collaboratively develop an approach that could begin to further reduce the number of individuals living outdoors and in camps.  

This may sound good and hopeful. But, what do you do about those in the community who don’t want to do this. In addition, what do you do about the “homeless” individuals who also don’t want to do what we’ve described here. There are people on both sides who are practicing their personal freedoms. It’s a conundrum. Do you respect the freedom and choices of others, or do you begin to set limits and standards?

The community has established rules, ordinances, laws, and systems to maintain some level of civilization and equity. There is no perfect solution or combination of rules — but, some amount provides a sense of balance and fairness. 

We’ve read in the news about fires, explosions, rapes, and assaults happening in local “homeless” camps. It’s a sad state of affairs. Some sensational statements made by camp residents have also been shared by the press. The picture that this aspect of the camps generates is one where many individuals don’t want the community’s help. Or, that they want the help, but on their own terms. For example, being able to stay in a shelter while having the freedom to not follow any rules and standards set by the shelter — like no drugs, alcohol, fighting, etc. 

What we are observing in our community is a complex and challenging problem. There are some who will help. There are individuals who want to or can be convinced to receive help. Then there is what remains. Ranting to an online community may be therapeutic or feel like the right thing to do. But it doesn’t make the hard problems any easier to solve.",38,2021-10-16 09:49:04 UTC

Imagine; small town with limited homeless resources

Imagine; conservative mayor who knows the pastor makes a suggestion - why don't you suggest to homeless people they seek out living arrangements in Kalamazoo, where there are more resources to help those individuals?

Imagine; pastor consults with homeless person, hears their story, shares the minimal amount of options available locally (minimal by design). But....the church would love to help in anyway they can. The homeless person is in luck, too; as the church has a fund that can be used to cover small expenses at the pastors discretion. The pastor presents the homeless person with 4-5 pamphlets of services available in Kalamazoo, and asks the person if any of these services sound better than what is offered locally (nothing)? The homeless replies ""yes, those sound better than nothing"".

They need housing. But housing isn’t enough. Just providing housing isn’t going to mean anything if they don’t have the skills and the means to live independently and maintain that housing.

Mental health support is meaningless without housing, and if that support isn’t flexible enough to work with each individual’s needs. Someone with PTSD and a substance use disorder that is focused on alcohol is going to need different kind of supports than someone with borderline personality disorder and a substance use disorder focused on marijuana. Different abilities come into play as well. This person with BPD may be more capable of handling social situations than that person with BPD. We need to provide individualized mental health services and substance use programs that work for individuals, because one size fits all doesn’t really fit anyone. That’s why we have such low retention rates in so many of the existing programs.

We also need to address the fact that many of the existing programs rob homeless folks of their abilities to make decisions for themselves. They can only go to the mission if they agree to follow their religious rules.

They can only go to these programs if they agree to these curfews.

We also need to address the rampant racism and sexual assault that happens in a lot of these shelters — it’s obscene how many stories you hear. Having been homeless in Kalamazoo, I can flat out tell you that the mission is awful. I slept there a few times, and frankly, the sexual assaults I experienced or witnessed just weren’t worth it. Especially when it was perpetrated by the staff.

You experience a lot of SA on the streets but at least when you’re sleeping rough you can fight back some. Or you can walk away and find somewhere else to sleep sometimes. 

You can’t resolve homelessness with single solutions, you need a larger scale effort of multiple community based actions working toward the same goal from different angles. You need trauma informed care, mutual aid, and actual respect.

Unfortunately, Kalamazoo’s only interested in bandaid publicity oriented solutions like the pods or the Knights Inn remodel.

And it is common for them to be arrested and charged with a felony, which gates them from many avenues of employment and leaves them trapped. Yes, sometimes people get insanely lucky and manage to escape but not every can get lucky or provide that luck. Even if they could, it is no assurance that anything will come from it. It's a flimsy replacement for meaningful change made to place safety nets and protect the most vulnerable.

The ROI is a healthy and functional populace which can then fill the jobs that capitalist institutions need to have filled in order to run their profit-generating infrastructure. The ROI is a productive workforce.

Is it more expensive? Yes! It turns out it is expensive to maintain the habitats we’ve created for ourselves! But that expense pays for healthy people who can have healthy families. Healthy families produce healthy workers, and healthy workers guarantee the maintenance of capitalist infrastructure.

Your attempt at a compromise here (it takes more than a month and a half to really get back on your feet, dependent upon circumstances) is quite literally a capitalist attempt to cannibalize itself to generate another dollar in its Oroborus-like consumption.

This is quite literally a thing that should be solved on a state level, because as you point out, the local level doesn’t have the power to pass a tax which could improve our local education system.

Because lets acknowledge that if Kalamazoo is experiencing a homelessness problem, its more than possible the rest of the state will see the same soon, if they’re not already seeing it now. And this points at a future issue as we also continue to pay for the consequences of climate change on our state; an increasing influx of people fleeing places that will become inhospitable for the Great Lakes region. A comprehensive infrastructure proposal like this is preparation for more people moving to the state, as well as a draw.

Republicans wont agree to this no matter what the financing looks like because poor = bad and undesirable and the ultimate conclusion to the republican platform is that the bad and undesirable die.

Especially if you avoid being homeless in the inland empire, where temperatures do rise. That is why the homeless gravitate toward the beach. It is even nicer weather - Mediterranean climate. 

Homeless people can't afford to pay water bills, it isn't like they concern themselves with who has the most freshwater when they consider where to live.

“We RaIsEd TaXeS bUt HoMeLeSsNeSs iS sTiLl a PrObLeM”

Bitch the fuck u mean. Raising taxes in order to pay for infrastructure construction requires time not only for taxes to be collected, but for the infrastructure to be built. You’re actively sitting here acting as if these efforts should wipe away the issue with a stroke of the pen, and I’m telling you that these systems need not only time to be constructed but also to begin to address the issue.

You’re overly concerned with cost when it is actively costing more to keep people on the street and out of shelters. Your concerns are, overall, individualistic and your handwringing undermines the confidence in these efforts that is necessary to ensure their completion and follow-through. A societal problem’s cost *must* be borne by the entire society, and if your concern is “people dont want to pay taxes” then you’re really not contributing anything to the discussion.

There is not, actually, a finite amount of money. Money, as a social construct, is basically infinite, and the only thing that truly effects the value of the pieces of paper in your pocket or the numbers in your banking app is trust within the constructed system that tells you what the value of those things are by arbitrarily controlling the amount of those dollars in circulation. The actual real value of shelter is unquantifiable. You can tell me a quantification of its value, but that is ultimately a subjective and arbitrary valuation. You can tell me an empty house is worth $350,000 but if its not being used to house anyone, it has essentially the same value as fuckin firewood.

The economic arguments really do come down to “it is cheaper to provide housing and healthcare with no expectation of those it is provided to than to maintain an impoverished class of people which has negative effects on societal health and economic value.” I actually don’t really give a fuck about where the money comes from, because its all made up anyway. If we just said “the money sitting in off shore tax havens is no longer legal tender” we’d decimate market values but we’d also have a reason to drive inflation down massively through that arbitrary decision.",1,2022-07-26 13:17:22 UTC

If one can grow or shrink the available supply of a resource arbitrarily with extremely little labor, then what value does that resource actually have?

You’re busy harping on about neoliberal monetary policy and bemoaning the fact that fascists would rather poor people die of exposure than scratch off a check which ultimately saves their economic institutions a non-insignificant amount of money by the mere fact its cheaper to put up houses and put people in them than it is to leave them on the street.

I don’t know why you think a Tesla and a House are in the same category of good. It shows me that you’re not actually taking the analysis I’m giving you seriously, given that shelter is a necessity and a Tesla is a luxury.

When political will exists for an effort or policy, it turns out that its actually very easy to get those policies enacted. We’re talking about a policy who the powerful and the rich do not want to put political support behind because it actively negatively impacts their economic self interest in the short term, because the money *does* need to come from the wealthy, by simple fact that they have the resources to spare.

If you argue the fine print is where problems are solved, I’ll argue that the fine print is also where a number of problems arise. Loopholes are in the fine print, as well as smoothing actions to account for potential unseen consequences. If you want to argue that it takes incrementalism to solve large issues, then you actually have to have the political balls to take a first step and bloody the nose of anyone who wants to get in your way.

You think I’m armchair quarterbacking, but you’re in the La-Z-Boy right next to me lmao. You’re layering just as much disrespect to the people suffering these circumstances by hemming and hawwing the (very obvious) solutions and actions that need to be taken. Society *can* and *has* provided shelter, food, and water free of cost to its members. You acting as though that is an incredulous assertion to state that housing should not be a commodified market just tells me that you’re not really dedicated to ending homelessness.

You think I don’t want to solve homelessness? You must not either.

The solutions *are* simple. You’re handwringing about the implementation of those solutions, not the solutions themselves. You think it is difficult because fascists control the purse strings. If democrats want an easy win, then come up with a relatively simple policy and fight tooth and nail for it. They wont do either, because they have to appease capitalist donors who don’t want to solve homelessness and a base that wants to improve their own lives and the lives of their neighbors. This is an impossible fence to straddle, and its the reason why you think this is actually a complicated issue.

Whats complicated about it are the logistics and timelines necessary to ensure the followthrough of the policy. What is simple about it is crafting a policy which enables the state to enforce a solution.",1,2022-07-27 14:16:42 UTC

A lot of the issues feel worse right now because frankly, it is worse. We are still recovering from the effects of the Trump administration and COVID, which are highly disruptive events the city never prepared against. What Kalamazoo needs right now is stability, and so far things are stabilizing. 

If you look at cities with some level of success in dealing with homeless people, providing permanent housing is a proven method. However to make this plan work you need consistency in good management and public support. Some businesses, in this case Kazoo Swift, may suffer in the short term, but that's where public support needs to happen. From what I gathered Kazoo Swift has mostly a positive public images but if they backout now and start complaining that public image may get tarnished. After all their core customers are people who live in the poorer neighborhoods who understand and sympathize with the low income population. I also think that's what they see in Kazoo Swift, the resilience of a small local business in a high crime neighborhood. Kazoo Swift represents hope for a better future, that business will stay and ride out the storms with its neighbors in testing times instead of abandoning them. 

However, if another round of events like CoVID or drastic political/ public policy changes happens to Kalamazoo, then I cannot say if things will ever get better.

Conservatives like you have been whining about taxes for so long we can't afford stuff like cops and social services that work. If Kzoo Swift can't make a living here he's not alone.

I understand how badly you want to keep your family unit together but I truly think that you need to start finding services for yourself as I think you'd fair better getting more resources as a single person, not a family.

&#x200B;

With that being said, Kalamazoo has an ID program which may help get you some form of identification. You will just have to wait until you get your other docs in. Ive seen people use the homeless shelter in their area as an address to prove residence. Call Secretary of State (yes, sit on that lame ass hold) and tell them you are homeless and need an ID. They can give you some options. Do you have ANY friends that can let you use their address?

&#x200B;

Has CPS been involved with this? I feel terrible for your younger siblings but you are in the absolute worst scenario and that's not fair for them. CPS may be able to at least help your younger siblings without destroying your family unit.

&#x200B;

As for your dad not working - Im sorry and I know you may feel anxious but having fear of a possibility of getting victimized should not hold back your family from getting stability. Again, you are in the abosulute worst scenario, drastic measures need to happen.

Are you anywhere that can get you an under the table job, like bussing tables or something of that sort?

Edit: I know it may be humiliating but you shouldn't have to walk miles in the snow. If you guys parked near your employment once you get your ID settled, could that work?

- homelessness seems to be on the decline. The jobs market is insane. Subway paying $18/hr. Pizza Hut paying $33/hr. I attribute the lack of homelessness to the job market, amount of services available (to keep them off the streets), and the affordability of Michigan - 3rd most affordable state in the country). I just don't see many (or any) people sitting on the side of freeways offramps, street intersections, or downtown sidewalks. Even people with disabilities (physical and mental) are in high demand - which seems to explain the lack of homelessness. 

- drug use. Marijuana usage is higher. You can smell people growing it (and not containing the smells). You can spot people ashing blunts/joints from their vehicles. You can smell vehicles (with really pungent weed) when they are smoking it. You can smell people smoking outside, especially late at night. IMO, I don't see many people suffering from (obvious) meth/heroin/coke. If we consider marijuana a drug; then yeah - way more drug usage there. Hard drug usage is probably down due to weed

- Crime does seem to be on a rise. Traffic infractions seem up - people just running red lights like they don't care, aggressive driving, etc. Shootings and aggravated assault crimes seem to be on the rise. Property theft seems to be on the rise. Burglaries and shopping theft also appears to be on the first. Summers always have more crime. IMO, America's obsession with guns and ease of access to guns is the source of this. My personal beliefs aside (I don't think citizens are responsible enough to possess the constitutional right to own an item whose sole purpose and utility is to murder), way too many people have a gun, way too many people don't secure their guns, way too many people have multiple guns, lackluster gun laws/restrictions, and the proliferation of ghost guns just continues to take its toll on the American population. Somehow Americans feel convinced the solution to guns is more guns (like the solution to cancer is more cancer, right? /s).",-27,2022-07-17 21:54:17 UTC

No other city is seriously dealing with homelessness by temporarily throwing some cash at some pods. It is a sign of the desperation to deal with the problem. But unfortunately there needs to be longer term solution. Section 8, permanent subsidies kind of thing. Some people just have issues. They don't know to wipe their ass. Their family dies, and they have literally nowhere to go, and they don't have the mental capacity to fulfill Maslow's hierarchy of needs. 

People asked for opinions and people got opinions in return. I don't know people dying from heroin. My experiences are anecdotal. I don't claim to be more authoritative than datasets collected by death certificates from coroner's offices. 

Everything isn't easier for everyone. But the labor market is stronger than it has ever been, with the federal minimum wage being a joke - because no one will even accept a job offer, let alone show up at those wages.

But more immediately,  downtown they could utilize houses that are vacant. It would be way cheaper to refit some of the non-historic homes into apartments. 

For people experiencing homelessness, having an address and stability combats substance use but also provides them an actual chance to become employed.  A job is the silver bullet for many of the issues present; gives them a sense of community and also stable income. I think in Kalamazoo ( lived there for 5 years including this past summer) the issue isn’t physical housing. It’s the individuals living on the streets aren’t able to rent the open properties. By allowing/assisting them to get housed then they can focus on other goals. In LA and most major cities they utilize a housing-first approach, understanding that people are less likely to get sober or employed if they do not have stable housing. 

If the tents/encampments become more permanent it will cause a multitude of issues we see here in LA; spread of disease,  crime and, overall the community becomes disenfranchised to do anything. ",1,2019-04-06 06:04:51 UTC

Permanent supportive housing is designed for people who are chronically homeless, meaning consecutively for several years.

Forced mental health and substance addiction intervention would, but that's about it.

Thinking that the type homelessness you see in this camp is caused by a lack of affordable housing, or a lost job, or an unlucky streak isn't going to help. 

If a roof over their heads, and just some voluntary minor counseling was sufficient to move the needle on even 10% of the homeless, then it would be getting done as the first step, everywhere. Hell, you'd be an evil monster if you believed that is what it would take and didn't do it yourself.

If you truly desire to help the homeless addicts and junkies, petition your representatives to expand conservatorship.  I'm no fan of the state taking action, but the mentally ill and addicts are incapable of making informed decisions, and treating them as though they are is going to lead to more suffering, not less.


As an aside, I don't understand how the homeless are even alive at this point due to the pandemic.

In all of my posts, have I ever once attacked a person?

And lastly, I'm not sure I stated any ""shitty"" opinions in my post. That homelessness is primarily caused by drug addiction and mental illness isn't an opinion so much as a fact. That ignoring the cause of a problem won't help solve it is an opinion, but you'd be hard pressed to explain to any rational human being that it's a shitty one.  That we should petition our representatives for enhanced conservatorship is an arguable opinion, you are free to disagree, even vehemently, bit that doesn't make it shitty.

More that your position(s) are.  Surely if the pandemic were as dangerous to people as the (over)reaction to it has implied, then the uninsured homeless, who last I checked weren't known for their peak of human health, would be littering the streets with their corpses.

Feel free to hate me, I'm a big boy, I can take it.  But, you really shouldn't want others to suffer. I'm not sure why you want the homeless to suffer, or why you would be indifferent to the plight of your fellow humans, but you shouldn't have that position.  

Is it because they're poor? Do you only value people by their economic worth?  That is a disgusting position. Is it because they have mental health issues? Are you that intolerant of people who aren't neurotypical?  Or is because many of them have substance addiction?  It's NOT THEIR FAULT. Anyone with the addiction genes can become addicted, and the pharma companies got oh so many addicted. And, while these particular addicts may not all be a direct result of that, the resources that would have otherwise been used to help them got tied up in fixing the opioid crisis.

Actually, my largest concern is when you said:

Look, you're advocating for eugenics.  That is horrible. I'm not sure the type of ""progress"" you think society will achieve by killing the homeless, but I can assure you it is wrong, and would be very bad for society.

I strongly encourage you to go out and talk to homeless advocates to learn that the homeless are people too.  Maybe if you did that, you wouldn't be for their continued suffering and extermination.

They don't care what religion you do or do not identify with. They don't care if you worship satan. As long as you follow their rules, you're golden. And nothing in their rules indicates subscribing to their religious regimen

.

For myself, I do agree with the City, the homeless have no business camping out at Bronson Park. Its an eyesore and brings an unwanted element. I mean sure, fights, drugs, theft, and whatever already happen, but there are a lot of homeless who are mentally ill that it increases that element to happen. Also having done janitorial services for the old drop in and mission, I can tell you that many of the homeless don't give a fuck about cleanliness and others property. I have horror stories to share if you would like to know. Like the period blood I found smeared on the stall in the women's bathroom one time. Or puke filled sinks that were clogged with god knows what.

However I disagree with the City's refusal to remedy the situation. You notice all the construction in the downtown area? They are always fixing something that doesn't need fixing. Like the sidewalks. Now they have the mall closed off because I guess the trees need to be trimmed or something like that. They could instead pour the money into improving the Men's and Women's shelters or even building a new shelter all together. But they don't. They claim they don't have the funds, which is bullshit. If you got the funds to redo a sidewalk six times a year, you got the funds to renovate or build the homeless shelters.

&#x200B;

And threatening them with arrest isn't an ideal move either. There are plenty of homeless who will commit a petty crime, to just stay a few days in jail, the end result is, they have a place to sleep and food to eat. Threatening them with arrest will do nothing but cause the already overcrowded jail to become even more overcrowded.

Kalamazoo does have serious issues with poverty, housing, and homelessness, but even if we substantially addressed those, you'd likely still see people begging on the streets. Some 90+% of the chronically homeless (key word chronically) in Kalamazoo have a mental or physical disability. The solution for those folks is a more comprehensive wrap around service connected to mental health, housing, and other services, as they need rather in-depth help. Solving our housing issues alone won't help those folks, as they'll still be left out due to their limitations. Having a better economy alone won't help those folks, as they'll be left out due to their limitations. Many have already stated here that the mental health hospital is located here and they often just let folks out. The homelessness you see on the streets is far more connected to our nation's lack of compassion and solutions for mental health issues. 

Some of the people you see begging aren't actually homeless. Many of the folks I've encountered in my neighborhood live in adult foster care homes. They have a home and food, but they want money for smokes and whatnot, so they ask for money. I have no clue what the percentage of non-homeless people asking for money is, but I imagine it's relevant. 

Sadly, we also are a destination point for a small number of folks. Again, I have no clue what percentage of what you see on the streets is represented by these folks. When I was moving here from Indiana, my neighbor's brother (who either lived with his sister or went out for months living in his vehicle) said he knew Kalamazoo because it was one of the good cities to travel to when homeless. He said he'd spent some summers here. He had no roots here, and I imagine many others don't as well. It's just a good city to be in. Not much really solves this issue. I was also at a conference on the west coast once and when I mentioned I was from Kalamazoo, some folks from Wisconsin said they knew of us because when they have a client with mental health issues and they've exhausted all of their resources locally, they buy them a one way ticket on the Amtrak to Kalamazoo.",13,2018-06-21 16:20:52 UTC

Housing affordability can be a problem. Especially housing affordable for young and lower income (for Kalamazoo - this is housing at 150-200k (or less)).

The theory is; jobs are created (or sustained) building homes. Therefore government money is used to stimulate local economy. Homebuyers have more housing inventory to pick from. Home sellers incentivized to sell will lower their asking price, due to new housing inventory. 

What is funny is; democrat or republican - they both want to spend money like crazy. They just want to use it on different programs and different beneficiaries.

Sure - in theory this will work. We build a buttload of homes. And maybe prices moderate, even decreasing in value. It will take months to accomplish. And unless there is more to the program; it ain't going to solve homelessness - just try to make housing more affordable.


I think the question everyone is also wondering is; who wants homeless people moving in next door to them? Serious question. If you owned a home, and a couple homes get built for homeless people...who wants that in their neighborhood? And how will the people maintain the homes? How will they pay property taxes? How will they obtain health care or mental health services? It's a solution to a problem - but not the homeless problem.",2,2021-10-07 05:15:45 UTC

Non-homestead homes did not receive that tax break. Also I was under the impression that was a temporary tax break. I could be wrong. 

Another point the Kalamazoo city taxes even after the break are still higher than the surrounding area. I just bought a home in Oshtemo because the taxes were lower for a far nicer house than in kzoo city. 

I implore anyone that thinks they can offer low income housing to the homeless for significantly less than the market rates to buy, maintain, manage and lease homes out for the reduced rate.

Mental illness is severely under serviced, especially for the homeless population because many do not have insurance because they do not have the needed documents in order to get it. To get help, real help, you need insurance because otherwise the medication is unaffordable and the treatment services aren't available unless they can't be paid for. As for affordable housing, again the services available for that require proof and documentation. The wait list for subsidized housing is ungodly long due to the fact that there is a lack of affordable housing. Many landlords do not want to provide that subsidized housing because of the stereotype of who uses that service. The landlords want the profit, and in order to be a subsidized housing landlord means taking less profit, and why would they do that when they can gauge college students? They know they're going to pay it or their parents are going to pay it and the landlord can make a surplus in profit. 

A lot of people assume that just any one can access services in Kalamazoo, but a lot of the services require you to be part of a certain zip code and require you to bring proof of that residence. Even churches do that. Diaper banks, food banks, etc. 98% require proof of that residence. 

This homeless camp is just a small percentage of a larger problem that doesn't jus effect Kalamazoo. Kalamazoo has the largest population of homeless children in the state...So many of my students are living at the shelter downtown. This is a problem everywhere. It's a hard thing to really solve, and unfortunately you can't solve it, just because there are people who don't want help or don't qualify. 

Instead of judging those who are homeless and peeing in public, maybe OP could have asked herself WHY this person was doing what they were doing and how could she be a part of a solution. What person can we call to advocate for more affordable housing that isn't in slums? How can I make this situation a teaching moment to my child or to a child I know so that they understand the inequalities and the inadequacies in our society.

Prosecuting homeless for sleeping outside may violate U.S. Constitution: ruling,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/kzoo/comments/9d3pyz/prosecuting_homeless_for_sleeping_outside_may/,2018-09-05 06:21:03 UTC,"The ruling interprets the Eighth Amendment (""cruel and unusual punishments"") and binds Boise. It is almost certainly citable precedent if a similar case were to be brought against Kalamazoo.

[Here's the actual ruling.](http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2018/09/04/15-35845.pdf) I'm still reading it, but the circumstances are very similar. Edit: Start under ""C. The Eighth Amendment"" on pg. 28 for what might be relevant to Kalamazoo, including citations to case law in other jurisdictions (Miami, Dallas, and Los Angeles). The nut quotes:

> We [...] so hold that an ordinance violates the Eighth Amendment insofar as it imposes criminal sanctions against homeless individuals for sleeping outdoors, on public property, when no alternative shelter is available to them.

> We conclude that a municipality cannot criminalize such behavior consistently with the Eighth Amendment when no sleeping space is practically available in any shelter.

Seems open and shut: once shelters are full, ""a municipality"" (notably not ""the City,"" meaning Boise) cannot enforce such an ordinance. Expect a Constitutional challenge to Kalamazoo's ordinance citing this decision, which will likely prevail. Boise could attempt an appeal, but I can't see the Supreme Court taking this up, and they're next. (They might; it is a Constitutional point.)

I see no possible outcomes aside from Kalamazoo following Boise's lead and suspending enforcement when shelters are full (or suspending outright), withdrawing the ordinance completely, waiting for someone convicted to sue and prevailing over it anyway, or selling the parks to a private organization and sidestepping ""public property"" entirely.

No opinion offered on my part, merely interpretation of the ruling and its impact.",2,2018-09-05 13:35:46 UTC

Indeed, which is why you'll likely see the call not even be made, and a defang of the entire ordinance is likely. If they care about the homeless, the shelter would be incentivized to unconditionally report that it's full to the city (so the folks it cannot take are not prosecuted), which would then have to spend resources to confirm that.

What you've put forth is not the legal argument in question, that they had no other options. Nobody even has to make that argument. The legal argument in question is that if all practical shelters are full, *and* someone is prosecuted under an ordinance for choosing to sleep on public property (irrespective of not choosing ""other options,"" which are not discussed in this ruling and not immediately apparent to me), their prosecution is flatly unconstitutional. The Eighth Amendment is interpreted rather broadly and there's a chance this ruling could be reversed in time, whether by review or appeal, but as it stands right now, by federal ruling, Kalamazoo is forced to reckon with a potentially unconstitutional ordinance in certain circumstances on the books.",0,2018-09-05 14:22:16 UTC

It's not even about the drugs, to me, because I'm a firm believer in ""you do you"" and I'd be a hypocrite for saying anything else; it's about leaving the detritus of your hobby in the grass for me to find, or a kid to find (yeah, yeah, ""think of the children,"" you know what I mean). It's a public park, and human nature is human nature. If you camp there, you're likely to leave trash, and every campsite I've ever been in from Yosemite to Hilton Head would absolutely agree with me.

I'd just say: I stepped on a used hypodermic needle in Bronson Park, and I'm not a fan of it. People who would use and leave said needle in Bronson Park are undermining the message that good, genuine homeless people are trying to share with us.

4. Do you know of any gaps in services that could easily be filled by someone like me?

5. Are there any secular services in Kalamazoo? Are there any organizations with no overhead, or with no fundraising?

* There are school-aged children facing homelessness in *every school district* in Kalamazoo County. Requiring a family to move out of their school district to get housing assistance further disrupts their education. This is about providing stability for children so they can get the most out of their education.

* Centralized housing also would imply temporary housing. This means moving in (and possibly switching school districts) and then, when the family may be able to support themselves again, it would mean moving out and possibly switching school districts yet again.

* Lastly, I think a centralized housing development for people experiencing homelessness could quickly become discriminated against in employment. An employer may choose to pass up a qualified candidate based on their address--knowing they live in temporary housing for the homeless.

Your absolutely right, sadly, we treat those with the least resources the poorest often. I notice many in the Kalamazoo community tend to make generalizations about homeless people from the few encounters they have had, or stories they have heard. No one ever tells stories about the homeless who blend into our city.

I think it is also important to keep in mind that poverty and homelessness affect people with mental illness disproportionately. If you have a bad interaction with someone who is homeless I think it is important to keep this in mind--we all struggle with our own demons, and when you do not have a place to call home that struggle is intensified.

POD project scrapped. ,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/kzoo/comments/1f9rze5/pod_project_scrapped/,2024-09-05 17:21:10 UTC,"In case they pay wall the article shortly:

KALAMAZOO, MI — An innovative project in the works since late 2021 to house homeless individuals in housing pods Kalamazoo will not come to reality.

Nearly three years after Housing Resources Inc. spent $1 million on 50 ModPod housing units — designed to house 66 people — the organization announced Thursday, Sept. 5, it is canceling the project and will sell the pods to another community.

The POD community, or “Place of Dignity,” was to be a 24/7, fully-staffed community providing transitional housing for members of Kalamazoo’s unhoused population.

HRI spent the last two years trying to identify a site to place the pods. In April, the organization announced it had [identified a location](https://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/2024/04/new-site-chosen-to-put-housing-pods-for-kalamazoos-homeless-individuals.html) at 2015 Lake St., just west of the I-94 Business Loop, and was hopeful to open this winter.

Prior to settling on the Lake Street site, the planned location had changed multiple times since the project was first announced in 2021. The Lake Street site, like others, had its challenges, including those in the community who [spoke out against it](https://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/2024/04/not-a-city-project-pod-housing-for-homeless-sparks-debate-at-kalamazoo-meeting.html).

“By bringing the PODs to Kalamazoo, we took a bold, creative step to tackle a serious need in a compassionate way,” HRI Executive Director Michelle Davis said in a statement. “It was something new and different. At times, that was hard for some folks to grasp.

“But in the end, our innovative approach sparked new momentum for addressing homelessness.”

That momentum, Davis said, has resulted in local municipalities working together to explore new ways to address homelessness in the Kalamazoo area.

Kalamazoo County and the city of Kalamazoo recently revealed a shared effort to establish a shelter for individuals and families who are unhoused. While details remain in development, the city has [committed $1.2 million](https://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/2024/08/kalamazoo-puts-12-million-toward-effort-to-create-shelter-space-for-homeless-families.html) while the county is exploring possible locations.

“It’s heartening to see our communities coming together to make sure every person has a safe place to stay while seeking long-term housing,” Davis said.

Davis said this local collaboration reflects the message HRI has championed: Every person deserves a place of dignity where they can rebuild their lives.

Davis expressed gratitude for donors and organizations that supported the project, particularly Clark Logic, which stored the pods for free and offered property to host the proposed site on Lake Street.

“The energy and support we experienced for this project showed that there are people in our community who care and who want to help those facing homelessness,” she said.

While the POD Community will not go forward, Davis said the plan also helped drive the five-year extension of the city’s emergency housing ordinance in 2023. It also prompted awareness and discussion of the need for sustainable housing, she said.

“The key now is to keep that momentum going,” Davis said. “HRI is eager to bring its expertise to the collaboration and to do our part to support a safe, secure and supportive strategy that will change people’s lives with dignity and compassion.”",44,2024-09-05 17:22:34 UTC

The last reporting prior to this was that they were “fundraising to be able to secure the site, hire an architect and construction firm and to have the site operational by winter 2024.” Perhaps they weren’t able to secure enough funding to make it truly operational.

Why do you think someone should give an employer their labor if that employer is not willing to ensure their employee’s needs are met?

I’d argue if an employee’s needs are met, they’re able to be maximally productive in their role. If an employer isn’t willing to meet a potential employee’s needs, that worker might decide that busking/begging is a better step to meeting their needs while they employ homeless services.

Also, capitalism as a system requires this economic underclass. The argument exists that without the threat of homelessness, people would not look for work, or work to ensure employment. Per that argument, homeless folks *must* exist to be an example.

Many people remain homeless because of untreated mental illness which they struggle to address because the majority of mental health care is paywalled. The easiest way through that paywall is with health insurance, which is most easily obtained through full time employment. That full time employment usually comes with a 90-day probationary period to ensure that a worker doesn’t just come get what they need and leave, which is more than enough time for an employee to lose their job over an issue caused or exacerbated by their mental illness.

This millage would replace that with ~$800,000/yr worth of tax assistance to approximately 1,500 qualifying families--about $530 per family.

This is really about equal access to quality education for all children. Children who's families face homeless and food insecurity are much more unlikely to be prepared and successful at school. Homelessness, safety, and access to food have a huge impact on a child's ability to learn.

All children have a right to equal access education, regardless of their family's circumstances. To make education equal for all children we must recognize that different children cost different amounts to have equal access to education. The real victims in a family facing homelessness are children. Childhood development is so critically important to health and wealth later in life and you are only a child once.",1,2015-09-13 00:22:20 UTC

Downtown is a MESS right now. Everyone is cranky because it's been a nightmare trying to get anywhere for the past several months, and they keep closing and re-routing more and more streets. Businesses are suffering because nobody wants to deal with that mess. That does not give anyone an excuse to be rude to you, though.

The new bike lanes have given the homeless more places to hang out and panhandle. (Edit: For those who lack reading comprehension, I mean it GIVES THEM MORE VISIBILITY, not that we created bike lanes for them to hang out.)

I've definitely noticed an increase while driving downtown, and I've lived here for many years. I've seen triple the numbers along and near intersections. There are a few shelters along Kalamazoo Ave, so they tend to congregate and panhandle on the nearby streets.

I guess I'm just used to it since I live downtown. I can see why it would be a turnoff for visitors, considering the construction and general mess/disorder that abounds.",56,2024-07-26 02:11:24 UTC

- Creates traffic congestion

- Increases pollution

- Kills businesses Part 1 (low population density = not enough customers to shop)

- Kills businesses Part 2 (thousands of miles of roads across low population density means higher property taxes are needed to maintain them)

- Kills businesses Part 3 (pulls people away from Kalamazoo City - and toward areas like Texas Corners)

- Creates a car dependent environment

- Creates urban heating (all these cars need a place to park, parking lots absorb heat. This creates heat islands)

- Financially hurts residents (all these thousands of miles of roads and utility services need to be maintained - thru higher taxes)

- Increases commute times

- Increases traffic deaths (more people speeding around your subdivision, just so they can cut that 25 minute drive across town town to 24 minutes - all to get a ice cream cone)

- Allows blight and poverty to spread, unchecked, in neighborhoods that people consider abandoned or no-go zones

- Destroys property values (the hot neighborhood of 10 years ago is just more suburban sprawl with aging homes, with no reason to live in the middle of what used to be a corn field)

- Increases crime (more area to patrol means police are more spread out, and not able to maintain a presence or respond as quick)


Other issues that I feel are important include;

- Lack of job growth/creation

- Inability to attract new employers

- Lack of focus on downtown development (no concert venues, no arenas, no reason to go downtown)

- Declining student population - which creates a myriad of problems

I don’t think homelessness is a problem for Kalamazoo, per se. The whole country has a homeless problem. Kalamazoo isn’t unique here. Kalamazoo doesn’t seem much worse off than other places. If we took residents of Portland or Seattle and asked them if Kalamazoo had a homeless problem; they would say there isn’t a homeless problem. I don’t even see that many people begging on the side of the roads anymore.

States and cities all over America send their homeless to Kalamazoo because we simply won't turn them away without getting some sort of services. Having worked and volunteering at the shelters that are in town I've seen people from all walks of life and from all over the country retreat to Michigan, specifically Kalamazoo, and the Gospel Mission, who profits from the homeless. 

It's a revolving door, in my time at KGM and even the Elenor House when it was open women and families would bounce between these places as well as the YWCA for homeless services. And a lot of times you'd see the same clients at about the same time every year or every other year at these shelters.  It isn't as easy as breaking the cycle and the issue isn't as concrete as we think it is, and now with the Kalamazoo promise having been here for almost 2 decades we are seeing a housing crisis cause families that once were offered housing can't get into it because of various barriers, most existing because we don't have enough housing for what is honestly needed, and with the sellers market a lot of former rentals we're put up for sale for record profits and a lot of landlords have pulled out of the renting game for various reasons.

We as a city can't seem to keep up with affordable housing options.  Yes there are new housing complexes all over the county, but most aren't affordable, and most that need affordable housing don't have the means or the credit to apply for said housing. And more and more people just keep coming.",19,2022-07-08 08:14:35 UTC

First off, due to Kalamazoo having services for the homeless provided by different charities it increases the number of homeless coming to the area. Second, low income housing isn’t something that just magically appears. It take a lot of time to build and develop infrastructure that can manage low income housing. Third Costs are rising in the city, this is simple economics. Property values rise as demand for said property goes up. It’s up to private business owners to set the costs of rent not the city. Kalamazoo has done significantly more than most places to create more affordable homes for low income. The creamery for instance is a development specifically for low income households that was a property provided by the city.

What there is no shortage of is individuals blaming the city for not doing enough while they literally do nothing aside from point fingers at others. It’s a complex problem but Kalamazoo didn’t cause it they’re merely stuck with it and a litany of other issues. Blaming landlords and the city for not giving out endless handouts isn’t a solution.

Cities across the country have elevated levels of homelessness. Mountain-west cities appear to have far greater homeless populations. Grand Rapids reportedly has a bigger homeless problem now than ever before.

This isn’t a failure of Kalamazoo, but a failure of cities in general.  A popular YouTuber named Johnny Harris collaborated with New York Times to do a story about liberal hypocrisy fueling American inequality. Johnny Harris is a good guy; you can tell he has a progressive opinion, but he is rooted in fact. He doesn’t armchair quarterback, he literally flies across the world to get up close and personal with issues. I encourage you to watch this video, and share it with friends. It was an eye opener for me. I never thought liberals might actually be….part of the problem.

https://youtu.be/hNDgcjVGHIw

The TL:DR of the video is; in areas where democrats and liberals have a complete grip on power (think San Francisco, New York City, Boston, Portland, etc); why do the cities still suck? Why are the issues bigger than ever, still? If democrats have all the answers; where is the proof that their answers work? 

IMO, this isn’t a Kalamazoo problem, this is a problem with cities, in general. I don’t know if it is entirely fair to just democrats, but in areas where democrats have complete control over everything; democrats don’t seem to be doing any better.

He is, just not with the group of people you'd prefer he shows empathy with. He's demonstrating empathy for the business owners & employees that have to deal with homeless folks on a regular basis. 

>Homeless people have been let down usually multiple factors...

Virtually none of those are the responsibility of a business owner like a store, restaurant etc. that would normally have a sign up that says Customers Only. 

>the change starts at the societal level of caring and feeling compassion and not complete disdain for those struggling the most.

He's not showing disdain for the homeless, he's showing disdain for a counter productive message. This message is not going to encourage anyone to rush out and help the homeless. It's not even going discourage people to be against moving a group of tents. All it's going to do is make the vast majority of people who walk by think that the folks that are trying to keep the homeless tent area there are a bunch of dicks.

A lot of people assume people who are homeless are bad, lazy etc when that couldn’t be further from the truth. Many people who look down their noses at people addicted to street drugs cant sleep without a drink, pop meds that aren’t there’s, smoke weed like its oxygen, etc. glass houses people. My fiancé and i were both productive members of society, he in the tech sector, myself a medical assistant. Through a long series of unfortunate events we lost our home, then our car, and we’ve been trying to play catch up every since. I do receive ssdi. But its not enough. Most places want you to make 3x the rent, have good credit etc. we’ve given up on the resources around here... we’re both enrolled in school this semester but its so hard and we’re both barely functioning. I spent last night in the hospital trying to control my blood sugars.. a year of eating dollar mcdonalds or taco bell has wrecked me. I hate it. I rather just not eat these days than eat a cheeseburger. I lost my mom in june and i cant seem to keep it together these days. Being homeless getting chased from place to place. Being constantly hot then cold, scared, no sleep, poor nutrition, those things can cause schizophrenic like symptoms in even healthy neurotypical people after a while. And there are studies out there that show that. Its not easy to get out of the cycle. But its very easy to judge from the outside. Even from within. I get harrassed by other homeless people all the time because i dress decently and appear clean and put together. They dont know it but i grew up homeless. Learned some tricks. How to sew. How to redye my clothes so they appear newer. Washing clothes in the sinks in bathrooms and drying them with the hand dryer. Washing myself in bathrooms etc. I have so much grace for people in this situation.... I remember last winter standing in line for dinner this elderly man walked up and offered me weed if i had booze. He said “weed helps take my mind off how awful it all is, but booze will keep me warmer. so yeah homeless people sometimes use, but dang it sleeping outside sober sucks!!

Given that it was previously illegal, and it still happened, do you really think this will make a practical difference? Are there homeless people who previously didn't defecate in public who are suddenly going to because of this change?  


If someone wanted more enforcement (which I'm hearing many people do downtown) then this change is in your favor, as previously no one faced any consequences of any kind. Yes, it was a misdemeanor, which in practice, means it's not enforced. How many cases of public defecation did our courts previously actually hear? I suspect none.   


If we already know the status quo didn't work, and we acknowledge that there probably aren't any homeless people who are going to suddenly decide to go outside when they didn't before, I don't see what the potential harm is. It was already more illegal, and that wasn't working. More illegal doesn't always mean better enforcement. ""Right sized"" legal structures allow for more effective enforcement.

I also worry about the message it sends to new potential business in the downtown development. sure the illegality of it was pointless and didnt do much, now you have it plastered all in the news that its no longer illegal (i realize criminal and civil are their own thing). So now new investment and new potential owners/leasees will double take and maybe decide to open elsewhere. I happen to know already that at least one possible new leasee did not exercise option to open where the union used to be in part at least due to the homeless population and the business projection. Im not saying it was a major contributing factor but it was definitely a staple in a coffin full of nails on that deal.

The scene looks like something out of Somalia or Haiti. It was mind boggling to see the amount of trash created; dumpsters not even a 100 feet away, and trash as far as the eye can see. The encampment had at least two fire outbreaks. There was at least one stabbing, multiple assaults. Then the rains in June caked the entire area in mud. It looks like a shanty town or favala in a third world nation. Something about it sticks out to me. The combination of trash, violence, fires, mud - it easily would be the scariest thing I can witness in Kalamazoo. It would also be (IMO) the least safe place in Kalamazoo. 

This is in contrast with California (who I will use as a positive example). They live on sidewalks or on lots. They use one side of the sidewalk with the building as a wall in their home. They put the tents next to each other, making it orderly and easier for health care visitors to support them. The have parking lots specifically for the homeless who live out of their vehicles. Due to housing costs in California, many people still work normal jobs and can afford a vehicle, but not a house. The lots are secured at night, have cooling centers, makeshift kitchens, running water, dumpsters for waste, and electricity. They have volunteers who help out, and enforce the rules. It is sad to say; Kalamazoo homeless people would be kicked out of these homeless camps :( (improper waste disposal, creating public health hazard). 

I never seen Jason Dalton or the Uber murders, but if I were a witness to it; it would probably be up there.

I will second the roads; a lot of roads have no shoulders, very few bike paths (especially on the outskirts around town), no ring-roads to pull commuters away from city streets, 45mph+ speed limits (And many people speed up to 15-20mph over. So do the math), many of the roads are darker (no street lights, trees overhanging the road), and many of the roads are practically designed to allow a 747 to land with 5 lanes of traffic. There are zero surprises that a dozen road cyclists were hit by a driver. It is maybe even more frightening to see how little has been done to address the issues. It is always concerning to see anyone riding a bike on a road with a speed greater than 35mph.",4,2021-08-24 12:34:12 UTC

This was back in 2003 or 2004. We lived a couple houses back on Hutchinson. I heard it as I was cutting through to my house behind the Uncle Ed’s right there on Westnedge. My roommate and I sat and listened through the window and watched across our neighbors yard; looking at the fence the shouting was coming from behind. We thought some homeless ( possibly crack addicted ) people were having some kind of domestic dispute, and the males voice was all deep and demonic sounding, to the point it gave us chills and a disturbing “off” kinda feeling. We called the police. As soon as they showed up and approached the little area between the store and the fence behind it, the screaming ended immediately. When they came out 5 min later they escorted a tiny little black lady no more than 90 lbs soaking wet. She had to be doing all that screaming by herself. And the voices overlapped each other so we expected 2 people to
Be escorted out. Nope. They walked her to the car and gently helped her into the back. I’m guessing she went to the psych ward. It still haunts me. We were already creeped out living there because they found a decapitated head and some hands in the woods between the McDonald’s and some apartments over there.

If anything, the city of Kalamazoo should be using the attention and momentum they have on this issue to actually do something more to solve the issue, instead of waving the white flag. Everyone is talking about it. Even the business owners and people critical of the decriminalization of public defecation are in support of more bathrooms downtown.

We can acknowledge defecating in public is problematic. On that we agree. We likely diverge in the severity of the problem. Statistically speaking, this is a non-issue in the scheme of things. It’s almost certainly a downstream issue of a larger problem — homelessness, displacement, individuals on the margins not having consistent access to facilities. And that’s a big problem, a nuanced one, and a problem criminalization only makes worse. You, on the other hand, seem to take the stance that this is a significant issue, that people are stepping in human feces on the regular, and it must be dealt with by bringing down the hammer of strong justice. We diverge there.

We can probably agree again that criminalization doesn’t always solve the problems it sets out to, and quite often makes things much worse for the individuals and society. That addict who gets caught with a few grams of crack or heroin, otherwise not one with any record or issues, jailed, their life prospects damaged; that doesn’t help the individual nor society, and takes away from both compared to appropriate rehabilitation and upstream measures.

And that’s the point you snarkily dismiss or completely fail to have the compassion & human empathy to acknowledge — that this isn’t an issue where criminalization does anything to solve the problem, remove someone dangerous from society (as should be the point of criminal justice, instead of locking up the non violent and diminishing rehabilitation prospects), or is severe enough to even be what it’s blown up to be because of the lying man child that is Tucker Carlson. 

So, tell me, how does criminalization help with this situation? How at all does it solve the problem, let alone solve it without creating bigger problems or perpetuate the existing upstream issues? Give us solutions, not conjecture.",1,2022-07-31 01:55:27 UTC

However, the people crapping on the sidewalk are those that have no concept of societal norms. Either through mental illness, substance abuse, or addiction.   
Not only do they not care about where they crap, they also don't care about whether or not they have a criminal record.   
You could expunge their record and give them a key to the penthouse in Trump Tower. Three hours from now, you're going to find them squatting over dropped trou' in the middle of the street.

Feral is a stronger term than I’d use for that, but I can acknowledge there are some who will always be on the margins. It doesn’t help matters when we’ve shut down some of the programs that existed to for those folks, like the mental health programs, and moved folks to the street. 

A significant population of the unhoused are former veterans. The statistics are unclear, but it appears to be 8%ish on the low end, 23%ish on the high end, 13%ish percent for the middle estimates. Either way, disproportionately higher than the 6% of Americans that served. As we saw with the GOP blocking veterans health programs this week and other past moves, that population has been harmed.

Here’s where I’m going with this: I agree there’s a population of folks that will always be on the margins and were likely going to be that way. But we also know that there are downstream effects of even short term homelessness — meaning it doesn’t take long for a person who fell through the cracks to start succumbing to the very real strains of stress, anxiety, lack of physical safety, etc. for psychological impacts to spiral. 

Knowing there are veterans on the street, and those you mention (the single moms), others who fall through the cracks in our society, and knowing when that happens it can be very tough to get out, is it not possible, or likely, that upstream efforts might be necessary to help avoid more folks who fall into this situation from becoming, to use your word, “feral”? And if we could commit to having reliable safety nets for the bulk of folks who do fall on hard times, the economic impact could be good for all of us, and then allow focused attention on those who would have been the worst off either way. 

No doubt, none of us want human feces in public. I’d just argue that issue is a distraction from the issue, and it’s easy to make this statistically small issue a focus because it’s shockingly gross, but when that’s the focus it distracts from the human issue in front of us and one that we might not be able to fully solve, but we can significantly impact…if we’d just be willing to see and address it instead of dusting our hands off as if all is futile. Criminalizing it also isn’t going to solve the problem, but it does create new ones, while distracting from possibilities to do more.",1,2022-07-31 18:11:30 UTC

The Proud Boys started attacking homeless people IMMEDIATELY when they marched toward the park.

They targeted black homeless people - this is what led to the ""violence."" Bystanders were literally trying to drag the victims away from the white Proud Boys in order to prevent a lynching in Arcadia.
100% believe that there would have been one or more deaths if a few brave people from Kalamazoo didn't throw themselves between the Proud Boys and their black victims.

I'd buy houses in up and coming neighborhoods, fix them up, and then lease them out to low income families that have been living in that area for decades at a reasonable and fixed rate. 

Gentrification shouldn't involve people who have lived in a place for generations being pushed out of their homes because landlords start seeing dollar signs. I think there's a very reasonable compromise out there that allows for both revenue and affordable housing. I don't want Kalamazoo to go the way of so many other cities that have experienced gentrification where there's essentially a 'service industry class' that has to live out of town and commute into the city for their jobs because housing is too expensive in the city that relies on their work.",1,2017-01-24 17:27:32 UTC

The park has become fucking disgusting since you moved in.  Garbage everywhere, tarps and tents all over, unsanitary food, and people afraid to enjoy the park because of you.  The shit show in the Park is EXACTLY why camping is prohibited there.
You have not furthered your cause.  You’ve just shown the rest of the community and the city government that you are an adversary and not a partner.

Because they either: A) try to bring drugs/alcohol in with them, B) start fights with the other people staying there or C) get back in line for the ER to get more food and a bed to sleep on.

I took my kids to the park last week and the tents were there and I honestly wished they weren't, BUT....

They are not at the park because they sincerely WANT to live there. They are there to show us what it's like to be homeless. The garbage that piles up around them sucks for us to look at, but when they move back to where ever they originally came from - a doorway in an alley, an underpass, the transportation center - that garbage follows them. They didn't manufacture the garbage to be obnoxious. The garbage is an everyday occurrence in the life of a homeless person.

The reason they're at the park is to make people like you and me who would rather NOT see them aware of their every day existence.

Everyone acknowledges a lack of affordable housing for those below the poverty line. I believe I read the best solution the city had was to build something by 2023. That's a long way off. A lot of homeless are also mentally ill, and the fact that the government has been cutting budgets for mental heath doesn't help the problem. ([https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2017/05/lawmakers\_say\_mental\_health\_cu.html](https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2017/05/lawmakers_say_mental_health_cu.html))

Yes, they're breaking a law, but they're doing it to make a point about their desperate situation. If after a few weeks of them in the park the city works towards more affordable housing, which in the long run means fewer homeless people on the streets in general, then it's a small price to pay.

You want to take the busiest part of the city, with the most intense traffic, and slow down the traffic’s movement through that area? I understand incentivizing walking, but if that is the plan you need to invest in much more than just these roads. You need to create somewhere for this traffic to go that isn’t on these two roads. You are going to create a headache for anyone going to parchment or the east side of Kalamazoo. Next is the walking itself. At the very least, that needs to be enjoyable. The homelessness issue downtown is already a major turn off for lots of people. However it gets solved, it does need solving. No one wants to walk through an area and be accosted for change multiple times in one short walk. Your going to be restricting access to areas which are being misused in the first place. This is going to make the idea of even traveling downtown even less appealing. We need better public transportation, for sure. The busses are getting old.

As to the homelessness issue, I think the culture of Kalamazoo’s homeless has become a big issue. It is one thing to hold a sign on a street corner, and it’s an entirely different thing to follow a woman and child to their car and pound on their window. It is most prevalent in the vine neighborhood. I think, before housing can even be floated as an idea, addiction services need to be provided and followed. There needs to be less of an attitude that the city can just save people, and more an attitude that we will do everything we can, but the people receiving help need to put in the work as well.

This is an important point here. I can't speak to your case, but people often make a lot of assumptions about people being homeless. I live by several adult foster care homes and I see those residents out and about all the time. People think and assume they are homeless based on a variety of factors, but they are  housed. They just hang out in public during the day, as we all have the right to do. Obviously, following people is not cool at all though for sure.

The Edison neighborhood - the neighborhood people on /r/Kzoo regularly shit on, calling it a dangerous area; this neighborhood wants nothing to do with these juulpods. IMO - the path of least resistance with these juulpods is going to be a location in rural Kalamazoo County. The city should look for farm/vacant land, with very few residents that would oppose it. 

I still think the juulpod idea is dumb. Kzoo should provide tax abatements, expedited re-zoning & permitting, and work with Federal Housing and Urban Development to secure more grants/subsidies/funding to build more section-8 housing. And - make this housing nice enough to please residents. In this regard; these juulpods are offensively embarrassing - to the people living in them, and to the people who call Kalamazoo their home. So when I say housing - I mean a high rise.

Kalamazoo Downtown is undergoing a revitalization - hotels, condominiums, mixed use towers, an arena. Therefore, I think it makes sense to take those HUD funds, donations from the community (the juulpod money as an example) - and partner with a real estate development company that specializes in building these. They should build a 9-10-12 story-ish tall building with a large amount of units (60-80-100 units). The units don’t have to be massive - 400 square feet will do. Because of the density - it would make providing services easier. Things like bus routes, trash collection, medical services - all could be easier to coordinate. Plus the area could be secured much easier - than a bunch of random juulpods. The homeless could have RFID badges issued to enter the building, and there 24x7 security staff could much easier patrol a building than a bunch of juulpods.

Ben Mallah, a real estate investor worth between 250-500mn dollars (also a popular YouTuber who advocates for real estate investment), showed off one of his high rise properties that is specifically for low income/section-8/homeless people. It is a lovely property - respectable for those who live in it, and something the community can be proud of. This is an example of what people should be asking for, IMO.

Anything else is just offensive - to the community, and to the people who are homeless. We’re trying to solve homelessness here, not make a shanty town of shitty houses that will be laughed at by everyone, before the juulpods fall apart.

None of them are complete losers, or lazy bums.  Many (most!) are addicts and/or mentally ill.

The ones that don't fall in to either of these two categories are very transitory, easily helped, and back on their feet in an apartment or home quickly.  While these people do need help, and we should try and do more, they aren't the ones that we're talking about when it comes to these camps.  It's the before mentioned addicts and mentally ill.

I'm not one for euphemisms, there's a few blue haired hildabeasts on here that use ""unhoused"" as though that makes them sooo much better and more caring than people who don't, and because of that I am hesitant to urge you not to call people ""lazy bums"", but I must nonetheless present my argument that you do not do so.

These are human beings who because of mental illness and addiction are incapable of making basic decisions in regards to their lives.  It can be difficult because what we see when we deal with them on an individual level is an adult, maybe a little (or a lot) ""off"", but otherwise a functional adult, when in reality they lack the capacity to  help themselves.  

If anyone deserves contempt, I strongly urge you to hold those preventing forced treatment/commitment of these people in contempt. Many of those complaining about your post, for example, would oppose any effort to actually help these people as being ""mean"" or ""cruel"", and champion letting them live in a tent city as if it is some great thing.

Or, completely disregard everything I've written, but please reconsider whether or not you want to judge addicts and the mentally ill as lazy bums, as opposed to ""unfortunate motherfuckers"" that ""homeless advocates"" would rather keep addicted and unmedicated until they're dead from exposure, rather than promote policies of involuntary commitment and treatment.",0,2021-10-08 17:46:52 UTC

Outside of the expense, is the fact that the more services and resources a community provides for the homeless, the more homeless it attracts from outside of the area. I know some people who are pretty in tune with the homeless problem in Kalamazoo, and more than one of them have mentioned that a large percentage of the homeless here are not from the area originally, and came here because we’re viewed as a “homeless friendly” city. That’s all well and good, but just a few short years ago, the city was on the verge of bankruptcy until wealthy donors stepped up to the rescue. That’s to say, we aren’t working with unlimited resources, and we can’t afford to take on more homeless from outside of the area.

Since multiple households can share housing units, we can assume there are over 4,582 empty, livable units. The Kent County Coalition to End Homelessness estimates there are 1,007 people in Kent County that are chronically homeless. By this count, there are \~4 empty homes in Kalamazoo for every one homeless person in all of Kent County.

If we consider the 8,026 people that experienced homelessness over the course of a year, there aren't enough units to house each person **individually**, but we must also remember that 4,145 of those 8,026 were families; parents and children. So they don't need individual housing. Not all of these housing units are suited for individuals anyway, many can comfortably fit multiple people. If we double or triple-up where we can, the entire **temporary** homeless population of Kent County can be housed in Kalamazoo alone.

Homelessness is a political decision. Every day the City, the County, the State, and the Federal Government refuse to do something about it, they are making the *decision* to let Americans die on the streets so the rich land-hoarders can earn a buck.",1,2021-10-13 16:37:31 UTC

Being homeless and doing criminal stuff = menace to society

Crime is a slippery slope. Police have supposedly seen positive results when they use some strategy called “broken windows” prosecution & enforcement. The idea is; small crimes that are overlooked (like drunk and disorderly, public intoxication, public urination, petty theft, malicious destruction of property) result in greater frequency of serious crimes like murder and rape. It creates an environment where petty criminals flourish, home values get depressed, neighborhoods get “rough”….

I do also support the establishment of safe injection sites for several reasons. 1. They operate on the principle of harm reduction. People using safe sites are much less likely to die from their drug dependence and that is huge. 2.

Kzoo City Commission Candidate Q&A,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/kzoo/comments/dnn9ie/kzoo_city_commission_candidate_qa/,2019-10-27 02:03:18 UTC,"The first step is setting standards for what affordable housing means. Right now, our definitions of area median income (AMI) is set at a county level. However, since the city of Kalamazoo has a much lower AMI than the county, that standard doesn't really work for us. What's affordable in Richland or Portage isn't affordable in Kalamazoo. 

Secondly, we need to find a way to hold developers to a higher standard when asking for support from the city in terms of tax breaks and other incentives. Their focus right now is on ""workforce housing"", a lose industry term that refers to housing at 80-120% of AMI. These new units are mostly studio and one bedroom, starting at about $800 monthly, which obviously is out of reach for many of the populations that struggle most with housing. 

3rd, we need a land bank that is transparent and fair. The county land bank is controlled by Mary Balkema, and she has almost total discretion over who gets to purchase properties and at what price. If the city was able to take control over abandoned and foreclosed properties, use their rehabilitation as an opportunity to train the local workforce, they could sell those houses in core neighborhoods at a much lower price. 

We also need to look at some of the zoning and property maintenance standards that are currently pushing low income homeowners out of their existing homes. I have a friend who bought a house off Alcott. A very low income single mom, she managed to scrape together enough cash for a real fixer upper. Less than a year later, the city issued a hefty fine for not having siding on her house, a fine that was more than the entire cost of the siding. That doesn't make any sense. 

Infilling older vacant city lots with smaller and more energy efficient homes would also be helpful. it would also require changing some local building and zoning codes, but would allow for development in neighborhoods gutted by historic redlining and the housing crash. 

Unfortunately all of the candidate events are over. This last week before the election is all outreach and canvassing. Here are some links to other appearances. These are my two most extensive interviews.

* the limited number of shelters and available space for homeless residents;

* poor building conditions at the largest existing shelter;

* accusations that police are unwilling to investigate allegations of assault at a local shelter;

The government cellphones don’t cost a thing. I see booths set up around my part of town (e. Main) that encourage people to come sign up for a free phone. 

And tbh the world of technology we live in now considers a cell phone to be a basic need, and rightfully so. There aren’t any more pay phones, or they are at least few and far between. Society is dependent on technology. Being homeless is hard enough. I despise that these asshats ruined the park for such a long time, but they are people. They are humans. They are important to someone, even if they aren’t even a blip on my radar, every person in that park has value and is special and important to someone. They deserve basic human kindness and it is society’s duty to care for and support each other. I am totally ok with my tax dollars being used to buy a phone and service for someone who can’t do it for themselves. Life is already hard enough. We can provide this support to have available basic human needs. 

I do get what you’re saying. I was jealous of the camp sites down there. They got better shit than I do. And I work my ass off to keep my head just above water. But it is a little bit on the ignorant side to just assume that a homeless person should not be entitled to basic needs. Or even something better. They have it rough enough, and maybe they don’t want to be pitied, maybe that’s condescending, but show some compassion. It goes a long way. :) 


Sorry for the long reply. It’s a lot of reading, but Im on my 3rd Red Bull today so I’m hyper, and I’m feeling emotional because of hormones.

I wish for peace and comfort for those who are homeless. I hope they get a break and maybe they can get a hand up to provide a stable platform to improve their situations. Tonight anyway. Tomorrow I’ll be bitching about how rude and inconsiderate and ungrateful the homeless can be. And deceitful. Don’t forget that. That’s my pet peev anyway.

You need to realize that many aren't simply ""bums"" as you put it. Many suffer debilitating mental struggles and have strained family relations (if any at all). These are humans who usually just need help getting back on their feet (some need a ton of help to get off drugs, defeat depression, and get a stable job).

Not to pry too much into your personal life, but your past posts make it obvious that you struggled in the past with substances and are trying to do better for yourself. What if these people are still struggling but at a much higher level than you?

And I don't believe that businesses are suffering from the homeless sleeping in Bronson park...unless you think the courthouse and handful of churches are in dire straights due to this issue. Please reply back with actual accounts of businesses being impacted by the homeless in Bronson park.",15,2018-08-21 13:53:14 UTC

I feel like your thread is a little dishonest, although maybe not intentionally. The gospel mission's environment isn't bad because of the gospel mission staff. To my knowledge they aren't the ones assaulting, stealing, or exposing themselves. The problem is the homeless population has a lot of untreated mental health problems which leads to these altercations.  When you take the homeless people out of the mission the crime rate doesn't drop to zero, it just gets reported less and they have less help.

This is the heart of the problem here at least in Kalamazoo. They are adults and adults want and theoretically deserve autonomy. When people have their own homes they have this autonomy but once they are relying on others they have to follow those rules. They lose a lot of their autonomy but that is just life.

The city made the right move to not tolerate homeless camps that were a blight on its parks, and the next logical step is to bolster affordable housing for those interested and engaged in getting back on their feet so they can contribute to our community and economy. Those not interested in that will find their way to the next city that tolerates homeless camps. There are plenty of them out there.

It’s a place I go often to walk or just sit and read, and I take my kids there to chill after we go to the library. People sleeping in the grass? How’s that threatening? I’m happy that our city can offer a peaceful spot for those who need it to grab some rest, a table to lay down a heavy load or enjoy a bite to eat, and a central meeting place for friends.

And although it's not legal to camp in the park, they're being permitted to do so for now.  As a matter of fact, they are being encouraged to stay there as the City Manager has installed portable toilets and that type of thing.  
Of course there is a lot more to it, history, and nuance, and liberul tears, and whatnot.  


But as a visitor to our fair land, please just ignore the bums and enjoy your stay.

Affordable Housing Complex Planned for Land Next to KVCC's Bronson Healthy Living Campus,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/kzoo/comments/ac8dwh/affordable_housing_complex_planned_for_land_next/,2019-01-03 18:14:36 UTC,"This project is dead, at least for this location.

The first step was to convince the [Planning Commission](https://www.kalamazoocity.org/boarddocs/pc?category[0]=128&category_children=1&own=0) to recommend to the [City Commission](https://www.kalamazoocity.org/citycommission) to re[zone](https://www.kalamazoocity.org/planning) 8 parcels on Lake St. and Stockbridge Ave. from manufacturing (M-1) and commercial (CC and CN-1) to multi-family residential (RM-36).  That request was made at [last night's Planning Commission meeting](https://www.kalamazoocity.org/boarddocs/pc/5013-planning-commission-agenda-january-3-2019/file).

[City Commissioner David Anderson](https://www.kalamazoocity.org/citycommission#comm-david-anderson) spoke first during the public hearing.  He spoke in his role as [Chair](https://theliftfoundation.org/board.htm) of the [LIFT Foundation](https://theliftfoundation.org/), which was the entity making the rezoning request.  He said the site was selected because the land price was low and was expected to earn a lot of points towards winning highly competitive [Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-Income_Housing_Tax_Credit) from [MSHDA](https://www.michigan.gov/mshda/0,4641,7-141-5587_5601---,00.html).  He said out of approximately every five applications for LIHTC, only 1 is awarded.  The scoring system places a high value on walk-ability and access to services.  This location is walking distance to:

* the [main Bronson Hospital campus](https://www.bronsonhealth.com/locations/bronson-methodist-hospital/), which provides a wide variety of [jobs](https://www.bronsonhealth.com/careers/) and healthcare services
* [Senior Services](https://seniorservices1.org/), which provides assistance and educational forums for senior citizens
* [KVCC Bronson Healthy Living campus](https://www.kvcc.edu/locations/BronsonHealthyLivingCampus/), which provides job training and education
* [Upjohn Park](http://kzooparks.org/parks-and-courses/upjohn-park/), [Kik Pool](http://kzooparks.org/kik-pool/), and [Kalamazoo River Valley Trail](http://kzooparks.org/kalamazoo-river-valley-trail/), which provide exercise, recreation, and [community events](https://twitter.com/KalamazooEvents/status/750789844331364352)
* City of Kalamazoo [Youth Development Center](http://kzooparks.org/youth-development-center/) on E. Crosstown Parkway, which provides after school programs
* [Bank St. Farmers' Market](http://kzooparks.org/kalamazoo-farmers-market/), which provides fresh, healthy food
* Michigan Department of Health and Human Services [office on Stockbridge](https://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/0,5885,7-339-73970_5461_66819-288239--,00.html), which provides social services
* Michigan Works! [office on S. Burdick St.](http://www.michiganworks.org/about-michigan-works/one-stop-service-centers/?agency=K#results), which provides employment assistance

After David's 10 minutes to talk expired, the general public was invited to speak on the request for up to 4 minutes each.  About six citizens spoke in favor of the rezoning request.  They were all affordable housing advocates and not residents of the [Edison neighborhood](http://www.edisonneighborhood.com/).  Some of them were members of the [ISAAC Housing Task Force](https://isaackalamazoo.org/our-work/community-task-forces/).

Ten citizens spoke against the request.  They were all residents of the Edison/[Southtown neighborhood](https://prod-photos.nextdoor.com/neighborhood/southtownmi--kalamazoo--mi/) and most lived near the subject properties.  Former City Commission candidate [Richard Stewart](https://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2016/03/downtown_design_review_guideli.html) was the first to speak and said he was responsible for forming a coalition of Southtown residents and business owners.  While Southtown residents said they were supportive of the need for more affordable housing in the community, they said this was not an appropriate location.  This area has a [history of damaging flooding](https://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2008/09/sundays_rain_bring_flooding_to.html), including recent damaging floods in [October 2017](https://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2017/10/severe_flooding_has_kalamazoo.html) and [February 2018](https://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2018/03/flood_victims_form_coalition_t.html).  Lesser rainfalls regularly close roads in the area, such as in [May 2018](https://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2018/05/portion_of_crosstown_parkway_c.html) and [September 2018](https://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2018/09/some_kalamazoo_streets_closed.html).  Even if the land on this property was built up to not flood itself, apartment residents would still have to put on their waders to travel on adjacent streets several times every year just to get to work and school.  Davis Auto Sales owner [John Davis](https://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2018/01/commercial_zoning_districts_re.html) questioned why affordable housing would be considered for the worst possible location, in a floodplain.  Other residents pointed out that [the sewer system in this area regularly backs up](https://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2018/04/liability_claim_kalamazoo_prop.html) and is believed to be under capacity.  Adding another 200 users to the [sewer system](https://www.kalamazoocity.org/wastewater) without expanding capacity would cause more frequent backups.  They said the land needs to remain undeveloped and continue to be a natural watershed until [the city resolves flooding issues in the area](https://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2018/11/kalamazoo_flood_mapping.html).

The public hearing was then closed and 7 commissioners began their deliberation, minus one who was absent and [Greg Milliken](https://www.planning.org/events/activity/9109761/) who abstained from participation, because his employer, Bronson Healthcare Group, owns some of the subject properties.  Because the land is located within a floodplain, the [Michigan Department of Environmental Quality](https://www.michigan.gov/deq/0,4561,7-135-3313_3684_3725-11255--,00.html) would have to approve the building site plan before the project would go forward.  Their charge would be to ensure that the project would not make flooding in the neighborhood worse.  While some commissioners, like Vice Chair [James ""Charley"" Coss](https://twitter.com/votecoss), were comfortable with allowing the DEQ to address flooding concerns, others were not.  Chair [Rachel Hughes-Nilsson](http://ocba.com/rachel-hughes-nilsson) said that in her experience (as a landscape architect), the DEQ only concerns themselves with the property they are charged to review, not the effect on the entire neighborhood.  She made a well informed argument that swayed some commissioners who were on the fence, like Vine neighborhood resident [Emily Greenman-Wright](http://comvoicesonline.com/22066/archive/community-homeworks-founder-takes-on-a-new-role/), who pointed out that the [KVCC Bronson Healthy Living campus](http://topics.mlive.com/tag/kvcc-health-campus/) is believed by many to have made flooding in the neighborhood worse, despite being subject to DEQ review and [funding](https://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2016/10/kvcc_receives_grant_for_stormw.html).  At least two commissioners mentioned John Davis's comments about the inequity putting affordable housing in a floodplain.

Ultimately, the rezoning request failed by a 2 yes to 5 no vote.  That means the 8 parcels remain a mix M-1, CC, and CN-1 zones.  The M-1 zone prohibits all new residential uses.  The CC and CN-1 zones prohibit residential uses on the first floor, but they would be permitted above the first floor if there are commercial uses on the ground floor (what is called a [mixed-use development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-use_development), such as [2700 West](https://www.mlive.com/business/west-michigan/index.ssf/2015/07/2700_west_mixed-use_developmen.html)).

I have been regularly attending Planning Commission meetings since June 2013.  These requests (rezoning, [street vacation](https://www.kalamazoocity.org/planningzoningforms/138-application-for-vacating-a-public-right-of-way/file)s, [special use permit](https://www.kalamazoocity.org/planningzoningforms/141-application-for-special-use-permit/file)s, [zoning ordinance amendment](https://www.kalamazoocity.org/planningzoningforms/140-application-to-amend-the-zoning-ordinance-or-map/file)s, [etc.](https://www.kalamazoocity.org/planningzoningforms)) are strongly biased towards approval, because they come with a staff recommendation for approval.  I'd estimate that approximately 95% of the requests have been approved during the 5.6 years that I have been attending these meetings.  I believe most of the failed requests have been special use permits, which are the only requests that aren't sent to the City Commission for final approval.  I believe this is the first time I've seen a rezoning request denied.  So, last night's meeting was significant for that reason.  Secondly, it was the most deliberative I've ever seen the Planning Commission.  They struggled with the fact that this request made sense from an affordable housing (access to services) and zoning standpoint (rezoning this area was in [the long term plan](http://www.imaginekalamazoo.com/plans/) anyway, as this is seen as a down-zoning to less intense uses), but made no sense from a land use perspective.  Commissioner Emily Greenman-Wright also felt this was the best discussion they have had during [her time on the commission](https://kalamazoomi.iqm2.com/Citizens/Board-Member/1149-Emily-Wright#history).

Here is TV-3's coverage of the rezoning denial:  https://wwmt.com/news/local/kalamazoo-non-profit-loses-first-attempt-at-bringing-affordable-housing-to-town",3,2019-01-04 20:18:13 UTC

The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC - often pronounced ""lie-tech"", Housing Credit) is a dollar-for-dollar tax credit in the United States for affordable housing investments.  It was created under the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA86) and gives incentives for the utilization of private equity in the development of affordable housing aimed at low-income Americans. LIHTC accounts for the majority (approximately 90%) of all affordable rental housing created in the United States today.  As the maximum rent that can be charged is based upon the Area Median Income (""AMI""), LIHTC housing remains unaffordable to many low-income (<30% AMI) renters.

***

**Mixed-use development**

Mixed-use development is a type of urban development that blends residential, commercial, cultural, institutional, or entertainment uses, where those functions are physically and functionally integrated, and that provides pedestrian connections. Mixed-use development can take the form of a single building, a city block, or entire neighbourhoods. The term may also be used more specifically to refer to a mixed-use real estate development project—a building, complex of buildings, or district of a town or city that is developed for mixed-use by a private developer, (quasi-) governmental agency, or a combination thereof.

Traditionally, human settlements have developed in mixed-use patterns.

In the [older developments](https://theliftfoundation.org/properties.htm), poverty was concentrated and some people could have zero income.  HUD would pay your rent for you.

Modern affordable housing developments are sometimes called [workforce housing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workforce_housing), because everyone must have an income.  In addition, rather than everyone being at the same income level ([concentrated poverty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentrated_poverty)), there are a mix of income levels.  The project proposed last night would have had a mix of 20% market rate units and 80% affordable units for individuals and families who earn up to 30%, 60%, or 80% of the area median income.

Kalamazoo is one of the few places trying to do something and putting money into this issue. We also have some developers in the process of building subsidized and low income housing in the area. This process is not an overnight fix, it takes time and resources. Do your research. Also, private development building buildings on their own property is not city related. I’m convinced that many on this sub are confused about the deference between commercial property that is privately owned and public property. 

If you don’t think the city is doing enough, why don’t you take your personal resources and apply them to the problem. Maybe open an extra bedroom in your home for free to a homeless family. Better yet fundraise, buy a multi-unit property, pay the taxes, pay for the upkeep and maintenance, pay all the bills (gas, electric, water), the insurance (liability and property), and let the homeless live there free of charge. If that sounds uncomfortable or out of reach to you, realize that’s what you’re asking the city to do. Stop sitting behind your keyboard and take action.

Without governmental redistribution of funds, there is no such thing as affordable housing. The cost to build is so high that the rent/mortgage is never going to be affordable. We lost so many housing units over the past two decades, and the replacements didn't keep pace with the population and changing living trends.   


Kalamazoo did a big zoning overhaul a few years back and that did help make more development possible. The problem is that the only ones that are affordable are governmentally subsidized, so the amount of affordable housing we get is tied to how much governmental funds are available.

One group lives in the town and hates anything that they perceive would slow down their commutes and the other group lives out of town but wants to commute to the town for the nice things it has vs their little towns like richland. They freak out about lack of parking because it makes it harder for them to commute to town for the nice stuff and they're worried they'll get stuck in their little commuter commuter communities.

I'll try to find the video but I watch a lot of city planning videos and what not on youtube and one went over this exact situation in a pair of towns in California. There was a town (unfortunitally the name eludes me) and then a community of wealthier people decided to make their own little town/village just a short drive away that was going to be all residential (like they actually made rules that no buisnesses could open there) so they were basically required to drive to the original town if they needed groceries or wanted to do any sort of shopping. The original town started taking out parking and lowering minimums and the newer town freaked out and called it an attack on them because with less parking the people in the original town could access the shops fine but the people that had no choice but to commute in had a harder time. It's just ridiculous. Happened with another town in Cali where the state passed a new rule allowing more building on single lots and the town petitioned to be an exception on the grounds that they wanted to declare it a protected cougar habitat.

Instead of 10 residents wanting to rent/buy every apartment/condo in Kalamazoo; it's 100 residents trying to buy every apartments/condo in Atlanta or Denver. 

100k over 30yr at 2.49% is $394/mo. Michigan is very....very affordable to live in. The quality of life a person can afford on 80k/yr (2 adults making 40k) in Kalamazoo is very high compared to most places.

Insurance and taxes are a fact of life. Even if someone spends 12k a year on housing (including insurance and taxes); that is really cheap. Like, people in many cities would give their kidney for that kind of cost of living. 

This forum loves to hate on Allen Edwin, but they are the exact kind of solution to this problem, if you are trying to solve the problem with detached single family homes. $500 down payment gets your house built, in 6 months when your house is done and close; you just need to come up with 1% down payment with one of their preferred lenders to get the house with PMI. Or if you have 0% down financing thru your own lender, you can do that with PMI as well (and I think VA loans and have no PMI). I've quoted Allen Edwin recently and you can still build homes for 200k without all the upgrades. So for like $800/mo in mortgage (not including insurance/taxes); you can live in a brand new 200k entry level energy efficient house that is free of asbestos, mold, lead paint, lead water lines. There are other builders who can do this, too. IMO, people don't want basic stuff, especially if they going thru all the work of having it built. It's a very underwhelming experience. Like buying a new car - but getting the cheapest model without any upgrades. Most people would rather try for a used, cooler car that they would enjoy more; even if it meant having no warranty and higher out of pocket costs.

And sorry it took a while to get back to you. I am no expert on housing, so I wanted to make sure to look back at what folks have shared with me on these issues. 

Another TL;DR (sorry, I'm a politician)

I believe that we need to construct more diverse middle housing options for folks, and what I mean by that is housing options in neighborhoods that are not just detached single-family homes. We should construct more duplexes, four-plexes, multiplexes, townhomes, etc.: house-scale buildings with  multiple units which are just as livable and also more affordable. In much of the US, it is illegal to build anything other than detached single-family homes in suburban neighborhoods, and that oftentimes alienates people who cannot afford that type of housing. I believe that this needs to be changed. In order to do this, however, I want to avoid imposing state-wide zoning laws and instead create incentives for local governments to make changes to their zoning codes. Overall, constructing more middle housing options in our neighborhoods will boost supply and affordability, ultimately making it much easier for folks to find good homes.  
We also need to go after developers who intentionally leave housing empty. If you’re priced beyond what is reasonable and are leaving homes empty, we leave the housing supply low for no reason except future profits. I want to explore all legal options to compel property owners to rent out units to those who have housing vouchers, or to keep rent within a reasonable price for the location of the property. Empty luxury apartments don’t do us any good.   
Another piece that could help is transitional housing, such as housing pods. I know projects within the city of Kalamazoo have worked hard to purchase a few of these, but I believe we need more transitional housing options and services available for those who need them. Additionally, the state should provide more permanent grants and funding solutions to cities and townships that are working on transitional housing, so these resources can be available for the long haul.  These are significantly more important than apartments or other housing options for the unhoused, and can be seen as a way to help people get back into their own apartments with the resources they need.

But, what am I missing? I'd love your perspectives on housing supply as well.",6,2022-08-17 19:50:35 UTC

While lack of affordable housing is making the problem worse, the stigma around homelessness usually is centered around substance abuse and mental health issues. People have horrible mental health issues that they can’t afford to treat so they use alcohol or drugs (which is sadly often the cheaper option) to deal with their problems. Even if they are able to get clean (either through the court system or charity) and get mental health treatment they often have difficulty finding and maintaining a job and stable place to live. As a result they end up at shelters where their meds are stolen and the cycle begins again. The vast majority of the homeless are stuck in this endless loop.

She also ruined furniture and never cleaned anything. My husband and I are also low income so on top emotionally distressing, it cost us a lot of the little money we have.

My point in telling you this is to point out two things: First, if people are really so concerned, then they need to do what we did. Put their time and money where their  mouths are and *provide direct help*. Anything less is empty virtue signaling because these homeless addicts and metal cases are NOT some kind of general responsibility  of everybody and no community has an obligation to be subjected to that shit in parks or any other public places because it's dangerous. It's a terrible problem and very damn few actually do what we did. Second, when doing what we did, be prepared for reality and the fact that it probably won't end well.

I so get your compassion because I'm that way, too. Nevertheless, for anyone to take on the responsibility of someone who cannot or refuses to be responsible for their own actions is a monumental and extremely stressful endeavor. Also it is 100% true that when people are given something for nothing, they become entitled and even more inclined to blame others and eschew personal responsibility.  What to do about them? I don't fucking know.  Just let this serve as a warning. Temper compassion with common sense. Respect yourself, first and foremost and keep in mind that the vast majority of the chronically homeless population don't respect you. I know that sounds harsh but it is what it is. 

This problem has become epidemic in this country. What they are doing in places like Seattle, Portland, LA, San Francisco, etc, isn't working and is making it worse. Any efforts in Kalamazoo to stop it from being another crime infested shithole are good. The OP is full of shit.",8,2023-03-08 08:18:39 UTC

cop city,63,https://www.reddit.com/r/kzoo/comments/11kz8xx/cop_city/,2023-03-07 13:23:32 UTC,"I understand your frustrations and I do address a few points in another comment under this main one. I’m not stupid enough to think that my suggestion will solve ALL homelessness or the problems associated with it. There will always be people who are willing to take advantage of the system and others (both homeless and not homeless).

In terms of healthcare the ER is a special case. If you go to the ER (anyone) they have to treat you regardless of your ability to pay. This legislation was passed because prior to that ERs could turn you away if you looked to poor to pay (even if you were actively dying) or require you to pay up front (which most people could not do). People were dying from very treatable illness and injuries. So we, as a country, decided that access to the ER was a protected right. However, the ER is the most expensive way to treat anything. This had the unexpected result that many people’s only option for treatment is the ER. The treatment isn’t free but when you can’t pay they have to write it off (and you get a ding on your credit history if you provide correct info). 

As for other forms of “free healthcare” there are Medicare and Medicaid. Neither of which are without costs but are the closest thing we have to “free healthcare”. 

Medicaid is the government subsidized healthcare for poor people. It isn’t free (there are still copays) but you don’t have to pay a premium and the copays are significantly less than average insurance. In Michigan Medicaid (with a couple of exceptions) is covered by private insurance companies. These companies are paid by the state to provide this insurance. The problems comes when finding someone who takes this insurance. Generally providers are few and far between. They legally have to provide some access but will often partner with providers that are extremely far apart. This means someone on Medicaid may be able to find a primary care but if they need a neurologist they may have to travel several cities away. As you might imagine this is difficult for people who have reliable transportation but impossible for most homeless. You can probably find a therapist easily but the psychiatrist you need is over in Lansing or Ann Arbor. You technically have “access” so the insurance company is providing their end and gets paid the premiums by the state. It is also important to note that Medicaid has copays but they are not paid at the time of service. Rather, the state will tally up your copays and you pay them every 3 months (maybe 6 months… can’t quite remember). Medication isn’t remotely close to free either. In fact it is probably the most expensive component. Many meds are simply not covered at all and again there are copays associated (and added to your bill to the government) that make it difficult to reliably access medications. Even most meds that have subsidies have language that prevents those subsidies from being used by those with Medicare and Medicaid. 

Medicare is the government subsidized healthcare provided to older people and people determined to be disabled (which can include being a kid in certain circumstances). While people over a certain age automatically qualify for this benefit, disabled people are required to go through a very long process to apply for the benefits. This is at shortest a months long process and at longest (for those who actually get it) years long and often requires working with a lawyer. While you do not technically need a home address to qualify it is going to be very difficult to apply and keep receiving Medicare benefits without a permanent address. Medicare does partner with more doctors than medicaid (though partially because it isn’t run through private insurance companies). You do have copays and premiums but if you make below a certain amount each year you can apply for “extra help” which helps to pay a portion or all of your premiums and copays. It essentially takes the money that would be spent by the government on having Medicaid as well and applies it to your copays and premiums. Medicare also has prescription coverage but that is provided by private insurance that is subsidized by medicare. Rarely are meds free (even with extra help) but there are far more meds provided under the insurance than Medicaid and therefore costs are generally more affordable for the average person. 

I’m going to guess that the person that stayed with you most likely had disability as there is no way they could afford a dog without a job. Disability payments are rarely enough to afford rent (especially in this market), food, utilities, and healthcare (even with the reduced costs due to Medicare). As a result they often end up out on the streets and/or off meds that helped them.

I do think it is society’s responsibility to provide for the ill and this includes many of the homeless. There have been a number of studies that have shown that providing a social safety net actually increases return on investment (less likely to use services like the ER or needing to involve the police). If provided housing in their time of need homeless individuals are unlikely to need to be provided that housing again. However individual members of society are rarely equipped to provide this safety net themselves. It is far better to provide the money (in terms of taxes and/or charities) and allow people who are qualified with the problems to provide help. In addition, there is a reduction in price due to working in larger volumes. Larger volumes don’t ALWAYS work (lord knows “the projects” were an epic fail) but they work in a lot of circumstances. If the government can buy medications in bulk instead of one person at a time it is far cheaper. It is the same for paying for providers. Paying a provider directly to work for the government is cheaper (and the provider gets more money) than paying a company to pay a company to pay the provider.",5,2023-03-08 10:28:30 UTC
cop city,63,https://www.reddit.com/r/kzoo/comments/11kz8xx/cop_city/,2023-03-07 13:23:32 UTC,"This is such a straw man argument. Other countries are able to provide affordable housing and healthcare while still living in a free market economy.
 
As for welcoming them into my home, should I invite them into my small bedroom I rent (not a 1-bedroom apartment but just a bedroom with a shared bath and kitchen)? Not much room for two of us in here. As for their healthcare, I can barely afford my own care, which is the case for a large portion of the population. 

So where can the money come from?… tax the rich and you will find the resources. We give tax breaks to those who don’t need it to survive or even live comfortably while breaking the back of those who are barely making ends meet. 

If we can provide care and housing for people and keep them from this vicious cycle it will actually bolster the economy. Fewer resources will be needed to “deal with” this population (police resources, unpaid ER bills, vandalism, etc) and many of its members can actually become a working and living member of general society. If you listen/read the stories and AMAs from homeless people you will start to understand that there are many challenges that prevent these people from reentering “normal” society (even if they don’t have any issues with drug use or the law). Many applications require a home address in order to apply. Other applications are thrown out if you do not check the box that says you have reliable transportation. If you and your clothes are not clean and well kept at the interview you will often be passed over for a job. Not to mention you need access to the internet and know how to use it in order to apply for most positions now. All of these are further complicated if you HAVE had issues with the law… even if that was simple loitering or trespassing because you were sleeping rough or were trying to get warm or cool and were deemed “unwelcome”. 

The not saying that solving homelessness will be easy. I also am not stupid enough to think all associated problems will go away with providing a safe space to live and access to affordable healthcare. However, when provided these services the homeless had better well-being and were less likely to need further assistance in the future.

Solving homelessness at a local level is a fool's errand. It's a systemic, nationwide problem, and the more money and resources you provide and make available locally, the more you draw those in need from around the region. If Kalamazoo provides more assistance, why would you live homeless in Battle Creek? I'm not saying that low income housing efforts or social programs aren't the fix (and I champion those efforts) but it can't be done peacemeal in some cities and not others. There will **always** be demand for below market rent. It needs to be tackled at a federal level.

2. I don't think the charter of the foundation was to bolster, fund, or reform Kalamazoo's criminal justice system. 

3. There are plenty of other factors at play that the foundation doesn't have the latitude to address - covid shutdowns, unemployment in the private sector, etc. A lot of this contributes to the issues you've described. 

Quite a few of the foundations goals are to solve the unsexy, behind the scenes problems like city pensions, tax shortfalls, and making the city attractive to investment to solve the biggest issue facing Kalamazoo: the eroding tax base. A strong city tax base makes available funds to improve the quality of life and maintain government function even in down years. Since a large amount of the properties in downtown Kalamazoo are non-profit or tax exempt (looking at you Bronson, Borgess, KVCC, and WMU), the impact of recessions and downturns has made the business tax base go down, and property taxes have to make up the slack. There's little buffer when there are company closures or down years.

If the foundation is successful at reducing the barriers to entry for new investment and companies within the city, and if it makes the city operate more efficiently, in the long term there should be improvement in the areas you've described.

Great, me neither.

This is an essentialist generalization and is part of the reason you’re getting a lot of pushback. Are all addicts so fucked up they can’t reason? Are all mentally ill people so deluded or detached that they can’t reason? My answer is no, and we should be concerned about the respecting the autonomy of people. The severe cases that you’ve painted onto the entirety of the issue *do* need a different approach than those with less severe conditions, and I *agree* that those severe cases are going to need more attentive and supervised care.

But that’s a thing we need to determine on a case by case basis.

> Now, I understand that it may be a radical idea to create a space where they can live and be made well

This is not that radical, since you and I agree on creating living spaces where the unhoused can live, attend to their health, and begin rebuilding their lives.

> and to compel that, but the alternative is their needless suffering and deaths out on the street.  I would like for that not to happen.

This is the radical portion. Compulsory treatment for addiction and mental health as a broad policy for housing the unhomed doesn’t make sense if we’re trying to address the needs of the individuals who are unhoused. I think it would be a misapplication of resources, since some cases are going to need more attention than others. I don’t know if you want broad compulsory treatment for the unhoused, but it is how you’re coming across when you generalize the unhoused population as mentally ill and drug addicted to the point where its hard for them to differentiate up from down.

While I think it’s possible that that kind of compulsory treatment might be necessary in severe cases, certainly I don’t believe it’s necessary in all cases.

> I believe your proposal, and I don't want to put words into your mouth, is that we don't do this, but instead hand them keys to apartments/other housing and say ""if you want help we'll provide it, otherwise shoot up to your hearts content and/or scream at godzilla"".

The proposals I support are housing first, yes. But I do not support proposals or policy action which neglects addiction or mental health services. Similarly, I don’t support proposals which hinge housing upon required compulsory treatment, because I see that as a course which undermines housing first policies which might feed into a prison pipeline that’s entirely unnecessary.

> I get that you want to compare a treatment/rehab facility as a prison, and to some extents it is, but here's the good news, all they have to do to leave is get better.  And until then, they're not freezing to death, robbing grandma, OD'ing, and jumping in front of trains.

Here’s another place where I think you’re generalizing the unhoused. This is not the solution for all unhoused individuals, and I think you already recognize that. There are a myriad of issues within mental wellness treatment centers and addiction rehabilitation centers that need to be addressed as well with the general and implied proposal that the unhoused need to go through these institutions in order to enjoy secured housing.

We’re not going to zero out the bad shit that stems from these issues in either case, but a home address first into treatment second at least allows us, as a society, to know that we’re trying to build people up from a halfway decent foundation.

> Now, if I understood you correctly you want the junkies and mentally ill people with brains that don't function correctly to be the captains of their own destiny as far as treatment? 

Again, you’re generalizing the entire unhoused community and characterizing them all as incapable of making their own choices. It seems like you’re unfamiliar with the concept that we cannot force others to change. It is impossible. In extreme cases, perhaps that kind of rigid supervision is necessary, but it is certainly not necessary in every case. It’s astonishing to me that you would be proposing this idea under a human interest story of a case that obviously was not extreme enough to necessitate what you’re putting forward.

What I want is for us to apply nuance and treat individual homeless people as individuals with specific needs by the systems we build in order to fulfill those needs. I do not want to treat this problem in a way that sees the systems which are supposed to address these issues like hammers, and the people who need those services as nails.

Do you not realize the term ""homeless"" is itself a goddamn politically correct euphemistic umbrella term to hide the fact that what we're mostly talking about are are either mentally ill, drug addicted, or both?  I mean, that's only 95% of the homeless, the other 5 are just assholes.

You can tell that's true by asking a very simple question.  If you lost your house tonight, do you not have friends/family to take you in?  Because if you're not mentally ill or a junkie, then the answer is yes, unless of course you're just that big of an asshole.

Unhoused.... Jesus Christ, what's next? ""less roofed""?  ""under walled""? ""Address challenged""?

Unfortunately there’s no good solution to the problem currently.

Poverty, houselessness, mental illness, and addiction are often interwoven but complex separate problems without a one size fits all solution. It seems like any time there’s any kind of development, one way or another, there are objections in the spirit of these larger issues as if they are mutually exclusive, but without any suggestions of what would actually serve these aforementioned communities. 

While a fraction of the spend on the new justice center, we did just complete the new ISK Behavioral Health Urgent Care center this year which seems like a step in the right direction.

> On the West Coast, a shift in language has happened organically as the demographics of the homeless population have changed. In recent years, owing to growing wage gaps and high costs of living, there has been an increase in the number of people who are newly homeless. Here, one of the preferred terms is “unhoused,” which denotes that people are being pushed out of their dwelling units by inequitable housing policies.",2,2021-10-23 12:27:27 UTC

Meet the 2023 Candidates | Part 2,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/kzoo/comments/1751dk1/meet_the_2023_candidates_part_2/,2023-10-11 00:56:35 UTC,"These interviews are ok, but do they really address the problems in Kalamazoo? They seem like such softball questions.

I want to know: 

Would you sanction police firing teargas on peaceful protestors?

How do you feel about a religious organization (Radiant)  buying up approximately a dozen properties with the goal of establishing a theocratic city? (Plus removing tax income from the city!)

Why are dozens of pods for homeless people still sitting in storage?

Why does the city feel the need to partner with private companies to surveil its citizens?

and so on....

Seriously, hang out in r/kzoo for a few days and find out what is really bothering people.

I would also appreciate a little more transparency regarding the candidates. 

Jeanne Hess' husband is a realtor. She should state how she will partition his business interests against the interests of the city. (Perhaps as a realtor he wouldn't want the pods or affordable housing eating into his business.)

I'm pretty sure David Anderson owns a multi-unit low income housing building. Is this affecting his opinion on homeless housing and setting up the pods?

I'm just a guy who lives in Kalamazoo and if I come come up with conflicts like this, I expect A LOT more from your organization and the media in general.",4,2023-10-11 01:44:10 UTC
