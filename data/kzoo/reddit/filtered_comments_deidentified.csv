I am a lawyer in [ORGANIZATION]. Fair warning, this is not legal advice, feel free to reach out to me directly if you are having issues and we can discuss your personal situation.

On [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] ([ORGANIZATION]) issued an order.) The order cites [ORGANIZATION], [42 USC 264]([URL] as authority for this order. The order notes that “COVID-19 presents a historic threat to public health” and that eviction moratoria can be an effective public health measure used in the context of a pandemic to prevent the spread of disease.

Under the order, a landlord or owner of a residential property may not evict any “covered person” from any residential property. A “covered person” is any tenant, lessee, or resident who provides to their landlord a declaration that

* they have used their best efforts to obtain government assistance for rent;
* they expect to earn no more than $99,000 in [ORGANIZATION], were not required to report any income in [DATE], or received a stimulus check under the CARES Act;
* they are unable to pay the full rent due to a substantial loss of income, reduced work hours, [PERSON], or extraordinary out-of-pocket medical expenses;
* they are using their best efforts to make timely partial payments as close to the full payment as circumstances permit; and
* eviction would likely render them homeless or force them to move into and live in close quarters in a shared housing situation.

If you are in a [STREET] where you may be evicted because of the COVID 19 shutdown, you may wish to consider following the guidance the [ORGANIZATION] put out in their moratorium.

&#x200B;

Hope this helps."

Housing (shelter) is (or should be) a basic human right. When we would rather put homeless people in sweltering parking lots than let them stay in one of the dozens of vacant buildings in the area...there is a problem with society. There is not a ""homeless problem"" in [ORGANIZATION], there is a [ORGANIZATION] problem.

The solution is not simply ""get a job"" as some seem to suggest. Most employers require a permanent residence. They run credit checks. Americans ***HATE*** the homeless. 

And the problem isn't the landlords themselves. for the most part, they are simply trying to eke out a living. the problem is Corporate ""landlords"" that buy up available land for the express purpose of being able to charge a premium for a necessary but limited resource. These landlords don't provide labor, don't ""work"". They are parasites on society."
64,2020-09-07 23:17:15 UTC,-13,2020-09-08 00:31:37 UTC,The evictions are just getting started in [ORGANIZATION],"My opinion is- fuck landlords. If you choose to evict someone trying their best that has fallen on hard times it should be considered a crime. Becoming homeless kills people, lots of people. During a pandemic we need universal housing more than ever. Please come and argue with me about how landlords matter too, I've heard it a million times and none of it is going to change my mind. If they cannot handle paying for their own land to keep their tenants from becoming homeless then they don't deserve to own the land. And obviously I'm not saying that it should be done indefinitely, but my god there is a fucking pandemic going on- if you are in control of other people's lives like this you need to have a contingency plan.

E: I'd like to know the ages of some of the people disagreeing with me. Seems like we have a lot of homeowners in here that have [ORGANIZATION] no perspective on how incredibly fucked the housing market is for young people or poor people."
64,2020-09-07 23:17:15 UTC,1,2020-09-08 19:18:14 UTC,The evictions are just getting started in [ORGANIZATION],"realistically speaking, how much does it cost to maintain a home [ORGANIZATION]? I am asking genuinely. I am a homeowner for [ORGANIZATION], and it seems to me that [ORGANIZATION], my maintenance costs are ***significantly*** lower than what my rent was prior to buying a larger house in a better neighborhood. Even if I ended up replacing every single appliance and fixture in my house over the course of DATE2, I don't think it would even come close to the [ORGANIZATION] cost of rent. I concede that I may be outside of the norm in terms of cost, hence the question. 

&#x200B;

>who's going to pay for it?

The community, but more to the point, land and housing costs are artificially high for reasons I stated in my original comment. Abolish (at the least) corporate landlords and see where the chips fall. I suspect the cost of living would be much better for everyone, myself a homeowner included. 

>Who's going to maintain it

The same ones that maintain it now - contractors. at best, landlords serve as a (very expensive) middleman between the tenet and the contractor. 

>Who's going to accept liability for the property?

The community. we pay more taxes keeping our homeless population alive than we would maintaining housing for them. 

>you can just give it to people and walk away.

Not to be obtuse, but...why? In the [ORGANIZATION] alone there are approximately 31 vacant homes for every single homeless person in the country. they are empty and serve no purpose - less than no purpose because we criminalize ""squatting"", so people that could actually use them are driven away. Like... I'm not suggesting abolishing property ownership, but not *all* property needs to be ""owned""

>And they offer a “service” to people who need housing.

This is almost certainly a pennyORG4wise pound foolish move as most people are going to be underwater if they have a financed vehicle. In this case my friend has a [ORGANIZATION] elantra so there isn't really anywhere down to go

>most importantly YES GET WHATEVER JOB HE CAN

Yeah no shit. Nowhere did I say that folks shouldn't be getting what job they can. But that getting such a job will still VERY LIKELY NOT COVER THEIR BILLS Even with reducing expenditures. 

>What does how much he was making before matter?

Because most people base their finances off how much money they're making? [PERSON]. Something like that. They base what car they get, how much their housing is etc off how much they make. Sure there are places to cut corners when you have to tighten the old belt, but there are relatively fixed expenses that can't be avoided. Student loan debt, [ORGANIZATION], Car Payments, utilities, insurance, etc. are all things that you can't just drop.

>Again, once all the help wanted signs are gone, then we can start issuing general proclamations, but until then, you're asking me to subsidise pride (too good for ""that"" job) and sloth (easier to be on government programs than work). I will do neither.

No No I'm not. That's a completely irrational argument and not at all what I said. What I said is it's entirely possible for folks who were very recently middle class and living within their means to now be in a position where even if they get 2ORG43 jobs they still won't be able to make ends meet. I'm not saying they shouldn't get a job, I'm saying they'll still need help even while working. 

>I fought quite loudly for them to open the damn schools, given all the science that says that if you're DATE2, covid is less deadly than the flu, and if you're [PERSON] it is roughly as deadly.

Yeah and that's illogical because it ignores the health of the teachers, administrators, parents, caregivers for the children. Sure kids may no die, but shit I just turned [PERSON] and [PERSON] gave me a goddamn heart condition that I'm now on medication for. We do not know the long term effects of [PERSON]. But let us say for the sake of argument that kids are relatively unaffected and have no long term issues.

So glad I quit my job. Nah They all got shit canned when this kicked off and their industries haven't recovered. My brother is a journalist and got laid off during this because subscriptions dropped because folks don't have enough money to keep paying for a paper. They laid off like [PERSON]% of his office. Luckily he's lower income so it'll be easier for him to find something to sustain his finances. But for folks with houses, kids etc. That did have a [ORGANIZATION] emergency savings but burned through that over the past [ORGANIZATION] they'll still need assistance even if they pick up several jobs at [ORGANIZATION], ORG2, ORG3ORG4ORG5 etc. If they get evicted/foreclosed on you're going to be looking at a massive housing crisis."

We all understand what it means for something to be illegal, probably better than you. The fact that you don’t understand this argument is about the constitutionality and morality of of the drug war is abundantly clear—so let me lay this out for you:

Here in [ORGANIZATION], we have the freedom of speech  and the freedom of religion. Freedom of speech necessarily requires that you have freedom of thought—to decide how you think. Consuming any mind altering substance is an adults choice to choose how they think. We already regulate alcohol—tobacco—pharmaceuticals—we have a precedent for taxing and regulating drugs.

In [ORGANIZATION] the [ORGANIZATION] administration was facing all kinds of civil unrest from the civil rights movement. With no recourse—they specifically chose drugs popular with the poor and impoverished—and they made the punishments as extreme as possible. By this mechanism—they cleared out all the adult-aged makes, political dissidents, intellectuals. And they still do to [LOCATION].

As far back as human history goes, human beings have consumed mind-altering substances—be it alcohol for social situations, relaxation—or the spiritual peyote, mushroom, cannabis ceremonies.

We know from every instance in history—most recently alcohol prohibition—that prohibition does not work. Particularly in the case of addiction, which we now recognize for what it is—a medical condition, these people will always seek these substances. If you’re in the jungle, the [ORGANIZATION], an [ORGANIZATION]n upper-class household.

So, knowingly taking money and grants to enforce laws that were specifically intended to target human behaviors that are universal—and deeply ingrained is the new racism. And they leveraged it as planned. They used it as an excuse to arrest nearly any person they could ever want.

Now here we are, [DATE] after the start of the drug war, and things are worse than when we started. Who else would be allowed to lose a war for [DATE] and continue.

And as a result, we have the largest prison population per capita of any country. And that large prison population is predominantly non-violent drug offenders. People who were arrested for possession and nothing else.

But most of these people being sent away for exactly this are minorities, African [ORGANIZATION]ns, the poor, the homeless. While they’re in prison, they’re not home to be a role model, they’re not there to keep their kid in school, keep them out of gangs, keep their kids away from drugs and alcohol.

I’m also not convinced these people are even that hard up… they always seem to have a constant cycle of newish looking vehicles in and out of their driveway.

I live blocks away) but this thread is wild out here dragging property owners for wanting a clean and safe [STREET] to live and raise their kids (oh I also don’t have kids… still no skin in the game here lol). It’s just nuts that y’all seem to think [ORGANIZATION] is some country club ass hood that’s clutching their pearls over this.

As for your question, I think you know its a strawman, but I will answer you. When I was volunteering in a Syrian refugee camp there were many groups giving out meals, but wouldn't ever stop to ask the people they were serving what they wanted.

I agree with you here. Like 100%!!! You are dead right, so we need to lock down our southern border.

> People get crammed and need space obviously, not everyone makes good roommates for everyone else, doesn't mean they deserve the [STREET]. 

There are exactly zero people on the [STREET] because they needed space.  There is no housing crisis here, there is an addiction and mental illness crisis.  Giving homes, specifically under your argument, someone else's home, to the mentally ill and/or addicted isn't going to do anything but trash the house.

> People need houses, and there are an abundance of homes sitting vacant all across the country.

Ok, well, shouldn't we just give the unemployed jobs building homes for the homeless then? That's the kind of logic a 8th grader might think is deep.  We have resource, so let's just give it away!!!!!  That won't work.  Nobody is homeless because they lack a home.  They're homeless because they're addicted and/or disabled.

> Look I don't want to fight,

That makes a [ORGANIZATION] of sense.  What you are suggesting is indefensible.

Yes, there are those of us who know that stealing is wrong, and people who advocate stealing from person ""a"" to give to person ""b"" is extremely unkind to person ""a"" while wanting to take credit from person ""b"".

> I know these issues can make people uncomfortable or even afraid

[PERSON], I'd say pissed.  I pay my goddamn taxes.  I mow my goddamn lawn. I own my goddamn house and my goddamn car.  The city/state sees me as a piggy bank they can extort funds from.  For that, I goddamn expect my shit not to get stolen by you.

Something I agree with 100%. It's just that stealing a house isn't providing housing, and nothing you've suggested is kindness at all.  Treatment and actual help would go a long [STREET].

These people aren't incapable of taking care of themselves.

I would argue that the public impression of homelessness comes from the people who are most desperate and most driven to be aggressively begging or who have mental health issues; plenty more spend time at the library applying for jobs, or are otherwise just aware that being aggressive is unlikely to help and just don't.

I was close at one point and only avoided it because I had family that was in a position to help me out. Not everybody had that support system. For most average people [ORGANIZATION] it only takes [LOCATION] to lose everything. 

A large amount of the unhoused population has physical or mental illnesses that are difficult to deal with. When they get meds to treat those illnesses they are often stolen because resale value is so high. Addiction treatment in this country is also a joke which lead to people losing everything and stealing from others (such as above) to be able to afford their next fix. Even those who just fell on hard times (no illness/addiction) have difficulty struggling out of the cycle. Trying to look for a job when unhoused is very difficult. Most places require online applications so you have to find a public access computer to apply with. Even if you get an interview generally you and your clothes are dirty because there is nowhere to clean up and clean your clothing. You will be judged harshly if you show up to an interview that [STREET]. Also you have to get the call for the interview in the first [STREET] and since phones are one of the first items stolen on the [STREET] you may not have ready access to a phone. There is also the problem of getting to the interview. What happens if the interview is not near public transport? Reliable transport to work is often a question on an application or in an interview. I have even seen the question “do you own a car?”. If you have two candidates that are equally qualified you would probably pick the one with reliable transportation. There are so many other issues the unhoused deal with when trying to become housed so a little compassion goes a long [STREET]. 

Also food for thought… the places that make homelessness illegal just end up sending their unhoused to jail… where they pay for their housing, food, medical bills, and to be monitored. Basically they pay for all the things they are asking for help with but saddle them with a record that then makes it harder to find a job and find housing when they get out of jail. It creates a cycle of homelessness to incarceration that is extremely difficult to escape."

This is actually straight up the [STREET] to solve homelessness. It is the most direct, most applicable solution to the problem of people not having shelter. This statement needs to be supported. Housing the homeless “doesn’t work” how? What “doesn’t work”?

>“American society in general provides ample opportunity despite what some may tell you to provide first yourself”

American society actively maintains homelessness as a stick for the capitalist system we operate under. The majority of people are DATE0 away from homelessness ***BY MEANS THAT AN INDIVIDUAL HAS NO CONTROL OVER***. When the majority of American workers cannot afford a $400 emergency expense, you’re looking at a workforce that’s two bad events they have no control over from being homeless.

This is, of course, before we consider the number of unhoused people who are in the workforce, earning an income, and not being able to afford shelter in the area in which they work.

The difficulty with an issue like homelessness is not that money is an inefficient nonsolution. The difficulty is that our society is constructed in a [STREET] that uses homelessness as a threatened outcome for nonparticipation in capitalism, and a punishment for those deemed as unable or unproductive. The difficulty is that solving homelessness is actually simple, but that simplicity doesn’t include an ability to profit off of that solution."

However i have to disagree. Since there is so much information available on why throwing money at homelessness doesnt work accessible with a quick google or chatgpt ill just hit on some basic reasons why just housing the homeless doesnt work though it seems like it by definition should work as you mentioned. Housing the homeless has been shown to be a futile endeavor that is not only unsustainable but causes irreparable damage to the communities that embark on this foolish task. Much part due to incentive structures . 
One of the issues with well intentioned ideas based on kind simple feelings is that one, it makes naive assumptions about people and how they operate and two they many times fail to take into account the complexity of issues. Some system
 may exist that could solve homeless, but if it does it has not been figured out despite the billions of dollars thrown at this issue. You see id say homelessness is not a weapon used against those poor participants of capitalism, but is rather a threat to capitalism itself, hence the large spending to try and solve it! (It seems this is mostly due to the nature of humans) Many people who are anticapitalist seem to suggest the system exploits people to the highest degree possible (which in a game theoretic view should be expected). There is evidence for this, but it is not as simple nor as sinister as one might believe. Maximum exploitation exists in everything humans do(those poor poor naive communists). Economics in its wild multivariate web sometimes has unintuitive consequences. Capitalism in a negative sense can seem harsh, but not only is it the best proven system, in reality it is just a system that incentivizes productivity and removes the hinderances. Maybe not perfect, there will always be people who are not well off, but it is also the system that has quickly brought up the standard of living of the entire world very quickly. Oh also, to say solving homelessness is a net zero or negative [ORGANIZATION] endeavor is not correct. You say capitalism is predatory and seeks to maximize profits. Then the homeless who are non participants should be its greatest fear!"

167,2024-01-09 20:59:52 UTC,1,2024-01-13 15:32:32 UTC,PERSON0 goes on boomer Facebook rant about homeless in [ORGANIZATION],"Another quick thought experiment showing why disrupting incentive structure can be dangerous and why things like rent control and higher taxes have been unsuccessful. Suppose you house all the homeless. Not considering where this money comes from, now you have created some income threshold where in which being homeless and getting free housing and government funds is better than being independent. This area is now a newly created issue. Now those people will be incentivized to seek government housing creating more issues. (Maximum exploitation! [ORGANIZATION] save us with your beautiful mind) Another thought experiment, suppose of those who seek government shelter an optimistic 1 percent of them do not have any motive to ever move out. Overtime this number obviously will grow since that one percent will stay and 1 percent of the next wave will stay now causing a large unsustainable homeless population that is being housed with tax payer money who have no incentive to ever stop burdening the community. This is just a very simplified picture of what would and has happened. Ideally a system that governs a large amount of people is one that allows dynamic participation that converges on a [ORGANIZATION] equilibrium. Government intervention causes issues for the most part."

Where I take issue with your position is your lack of sources ([ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] are not sources), and the fact you point at incentive structures as being part of the issue when the incentive structures cited are informed explicitly by their existence within capitalism. Citing “human nature” is also trash, since human nature includes both the altruism to ensure people are taken care of as well as the want to exploit or self destruct. Human nature as we take it is informed by the kind of societies we’ve constructed for ourselves.

If housing the homeless “irreparably damages the communities that embark on this foolish task” i have to ask how much work that community has done on folding those people into the community rather than continuing to treat those housed this [STREET] as social pariahs. I would also ask what form of “irreparable damage” occurs, and why and how that damage is irreparable. Its not like transient populations dump PFASes into the environment."

If you ask me, i think you pointing out the altruistic side of humans is certainly key. We have emotions that lead us to deviate from our exploitative and game theoretically optimal nature. This is another topic of discussion that may seem like a random addon to the topic at hand, but the real solution to homelessness would be an update in belief structures which is a more esoteric concept that seems like the end all be all of the beginnings and endings of civilizations. Im a bit cynical about the trajectory of our society. I think the west if not the world is pretty fked. We are living in a time where religious frameworks/ belief structures have unraveled  we have fallen into ideological relativism (the movie joker a canary in the coal mine.

Hm maybe, between you and I we can say this,  but we are talking about a macro issue and i believe as such we must consider the fact that on a macro level where there is money there is movement.

One of the unfortunate realities of our society is that nothing is sustainable if not profitable. Altruism has its limits though we like to believe ourselves all benevolent. Everyone does need shelter, especially those that will fuel the capitalistic machine, which is why i believe capitalism seeks to house as many people in their little white fenced homes right in the unescapable financial situation zones as possible. Which if you ask a poor man in [ORGANIZATION] is a dream come true. For us spoiled americans who see kids playing video games making a million in [LOCATION] we may have become jaded. 

My apologies on not being precise about the independent part. I didnt mean to imply being independent is some important thing on an individual level, i meant that those who are self sustaining and non-reliant on government housing are more beneficial to the system. Creating a threshold for government housing and stipend creates an incentive for people to become reliant and thus burdening the system creating cascading issue.

Our society [ORGANIZATION] would not exist were it not for the strength of the human social instinct. Our strength is our numbers, our sociability, and our ingenuity.

Capitalism incentivizes self centered self interest at the expense of those around us. It incentivizes competition in areas where cooperation is a more effective approach. It incentivizes the collection and sequestering of resources away from those who might need those resources. It incentivizes creating gates around things that do not have to be gated in order to construct a path to profit.

At the end of [LOCATION], solving homelessness is a socialist and communist project, and not a capitalist one.

Yes, we agree on this. This is *the* barrier to addressing macro social issues like homelessness. We *have* to accept that it is actually unquantifiable for how expensive it is to house everyone and integrate them into society in a manner that addresses their needs and their health. This is quite literally not about altruism, but about maintaining a healthy environment for all of us, which we should all be incentivized to do as a matter of continued self existence. You speak to capitalism’s incentive to house as many as possible within inescapable economic zones, but do not consider that one of those zones is homelessness, which is maintained as a function of capitalism.

You continue to argue from a perspective of the capitalist. Independence as a function of beneficial existence to the system of capitalism is not actually independence. You seem to think I want to draw an arbitrary line on provided housing and stipends. I would ask you to point to where I suggested that, because I didn’t. Those things should be universal.

The three major cities you point at have all failed at addressing homelessness the same [STREET] we’re failing to address it here, because we’re all approaching this from a capitalist framework that insists that *someone* has to make money off of the solution at [DATE], and until we can collectively reconcile that that *will never happen* we **will** continue to fail to address the issue."

[ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] -- The city of [ORGANIZATION] is contributing $500,000 to a countywide effort to establish an emergency shelter for families experiencing homelessness.
The money must be used for the “acquisition and/or construction of a shelter for families with children in [PERSON],” per city documents.
The county has acquired a hotel in GPE4 that will be used as a shelter, [ORGANIZATION] said. Further details about the project are not available at this time ― including which hotel this is.
[ORGANIZATION] officials have been meeting with the city of GPE4, [PERSON], [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] on a [ORGANIZATION] basis to discuss housing challenges in the area for [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION] City Manager [PERSON] said.
The city of GPE4 committed $1.2 million in [ORGANIZATION] relief funding to the same project DATE2. Money from the county housing millage could also be used on the project, per [ORGANIZATION] documents.

Though homelessness is most visible in the city of GPE4, [ORGANIZATION] said families and children are coming from all over the county -- including from [ORGANIZATION].
“In [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON], we had 132 homeless kids in our public schools,” [ORGANIZATION] said. “They need somewhere to live, hopefully with their siblings, with their parents.”

While housing projects for those who make 80% to 120% of the area median income are often presented to the council, this project will help people in the lowest income ranges, [ORGANIZATION] said.

The project also comes as a response to the [LOCATION] ORG2’s decision to close Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) waiting lists for the foreseeable future.

With family homelessness on the rise and the housing voucher system closed, there will be an immediate need for emergency shelter space to prevent families with children from seeking shelter in substandard housing, according to city documents.

[PERSON], the county’s ORG3 program counted 664 people were experiencing homelessness on [TIME] [DATE] in [PERSON]. That’s a 13% increase from [PERSON] and the highest mark in [ORGANIZATION]."

Assuming we have a disproportionately high homeless population compared to other similarly sized cities, we should at least give some homeless people the option of being given transportation to another city where they either have some sort of potential support system or, maybe more controversially, just somewhere else they’d rather be if they were dumped here against their will.

Spend all the money on bussing them to another city, and see who runs out of money first. If the other city runs out of money bussing the homeless back to your city, you win! So long as you have the money to bus them back out again.

The rules are, if you end up with all the homeless people and or no money, you lose. If you end up with no homeless people and some money still, you win!"

The buck is[LOCATION] being passed to [ORGANIZATION] when, per the article, there is cooperation and communication between [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] about this.

There’s nothing to be done about being perceived as having the resources to help the homeless as we build the resources to help the homeless. What we should do is convince those other regions that making the same investments in their own areas is a better course of action than trying to make their homeless population someone else’s burden; we all shoulder this burden.

Your approach to providing transportation has more compassion built into it, I admit, but without a better network across the country to help the homeless, I fear it doesn’t do much to address the issue. I also think focusing on “limiting the population” puts more focus on bussing people out than building the in depth resources necessary for addressing people’s needs."

You have the homeless who are mentally unwell, those that are addicts, those that have mental health issues AND are addicts, those who are capable of becoming employed and leading what we’d consider to be a normal life and those who are going to continuously find themselves in trouble with the law. 

There almost needs to be a social worker assigned to each individual or family to seek out a path to improve their situation, but even then there needs to be an alternative for when that fails. I think when that fails it’s either because of addiction, or if someone may just be so far gone mentally, or again someone just cannot stop committing crimes lol. IF we were to provide free medication to them there’s still no [STREET] to ensure they keep taking it. There has to be something like an institution where people can be supervised and cared for. Though idk what lands you in a state mental institution or if it requires like a family member admitting you? Hard to think of a solution that doesn’t in someway infringe on people’s freedoms, either [STREET] I think this requires so much individual attention than we’re giving it that it feels like just a scratch in the surface to get at least one category of homeless situation/cause under control, but it is better than nothing so generally I’m not even against what’s being proposed here."

Maybe the City folk and the shelters don’t realize this? Ask every homeless person where they are from, I bet 1/3 or less say [ORGANIZATION].

I work in mental health and run [ORGANIZATION], which basically works with exactly this population and other folks who struggle to live independently or go in and out of hospitals a lot due to severe, chronic mental health issues. I’m going to just enhance your already wonderful answer real quick for the folks that need to hear it. 

a) people do not realize the mental energy it takes to just survive when you’re homeless or about to be and that’s before you factor in any pre-existing mental disorders. 

b) my job is to help people stick to treatment, but often they have to seek out that treatment first, so see the first point above. 

c) I interned at the ORG1 for [ORGANIZATION] and can confirm that it can feel very uncomfortable for non religious folks. Plus, with any shelter, they often can’t bring all their many bags of belongings in with them. Imagine losing your whole life and all you got is the stuff you can carry or push in a cart - clothes, family photos, your mom’s urn- and then being told you gotta leave it outside where anyone can go through it or steal it overnight. Also no pets allowed. Other people have trauma from being assaulted in similar shelters. I would choose the tent at that point. 

d) [ORGANIZATION] is making this worse. Every time I see a cute blonde girl showing what life is like living in her car, parked outside a ORG2 with all her little privacy and safety gadgets, when it’s clear this is 100% by choice, I want to scream. 

e) What I tell people is if I’d lost everything and was living like that, I’d probably use some meth too. You can’t ask people to get sober when they are in an unimaginable situation where they don’t feel that they even have a life worth living. Help first, then healing.

However after [PERSON]'s taking power in DATE5 most of the provisions of the [ORGANIZATION] Act were cut from the budget resulting in a very permissive system in the [ORGANIZATION] (mentally ill patients can't be confined in most circumstances)bwhich does not have the funding to provide an adequate level of outpatient services to the population.  This combination of a poor social safety net plus a ""catch and release"" policy towards the mentally ill results in afflicted individuals disproportionately ending up in homeless shelters and jails.  Comprehensive reform risks expanding ""entitlements"" and social spending, which has been virtually impossible since [ORGANIZATION] due to increasing partisan gridlock and a hawkish Republican party on budget issues. This isn't to blame the Republicans exclusively, but to show how partisan gridlock and changing priorities leads to gutted and wasteful programs that don't serve their original purpose.  Even if one party took power in the [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] and passed reform, the parties are so entrenched that it would likely be gutted by the next administration in [LOCATION]."

Then the housing that the city built, the hotel they converted, which was suppose to be open in [LOCATION] has yet to still open and allow people to live there.

What can we do as a community to help our homeless population?,"It’s multi fold, but the problem is that nobody wants to actually accept the reality of the situation. There’s been a lot coming out of the western cities lately about what is actually driving the “homeless” population. In reality, and there’s a great book called [ORGANIZATION] written by someone actually in the “homeless” scene there, that describe the “homeless” encampment as actually being an Open Drug Scene. Now these [ORGANIZATION] are more apt descriptions of the encampments, which is why I air quoted homeless. The term homeless is a misnomer and kind of implicitly innocent. We hear homessless and immediately think these are just friendly people on tough times. Do[LOCATION] get me wrong, they are in need of state intervention AND financial support. But they also need to be held accountable. The reality is most are likely on drugs. That’s not stereotyping it’s again a fact they’re studying and finding in these [ORGANIZATION]. The usual progression of people living in [ORGANIZATION] goes something like poor background, high chance of sexual or physical abuse in childhood, mental disorders, etc. leading to eventual drug usage. Drug usage gets out of control and eventually lose job, [STREET] of residence, burn all bridges couch surfing and eventually end up on the [STREET]. Drug usage worsens as individual has no money because it solves 2 problems: 1) what will you do with your time 2) what will you eat? Hard to be hungry on amphetamines or opioids. 

Where the problem gets complicated is the solution most often offered is just give them things and they’ll be better. This is the liberal mindset, but it leaves out the portion where they need to be given things AND held accountable to have a job, stay clean and in general make good life decisions. The other mindset is they made the choice and their proverbial bed, so they can either pull themselves up or fuck em. This is the more conservative perspective. The problem is when you’re in [ORGANIZATION] and hooked on these crazier drugs, they really fuck with your cognitive abilities. So the chance of boot strapping your [STREET] out of an intense drug addiction is like next to nill.

The last problem is the police and the justice system in general. With all the push back on police they really do[LOCATION] need the PR of picking on bums, particularly of minority descent. But that means the consequences for the [ORGANIZATION] actions are[LOCATION] checked either. Furthermore, if the cops do in fact arrest someone in [ORGANIZATION] likely on drug charges, they’re charged as felons and just totally fucked. We have shit diversion problems because echoes of [ORGANIZATION] ([ORGANIZATION]) and [ORGANIZATION] war on drugs makes all this shit [STREET] too illegal. Using drugs in public should be a slap on the wrist and cause to put you into intense drug diversion program and therapy. If you use and live on the [STREET] you should be arrested and *charged with a misdemeanor* where you have to go in front of a judge with your family (if any exists) and try to do better. 

But we ca[LOCATION] solve any of this because we ca[LOCATION] even frame the narrative around the discussion or problem correctly in the first [STREET].

What can we do as a community to help our homeless population?,"1) Cheaper housing - section 8 has a long waiting list and many places don’t take vouchers. Even then people can’t afford the 30% of their income plus utilities plus food and necessary item. There are charities all around that help with those things but also require applications and meetings all around town. It becomes a full time job just to be able to afford a [STREET] to live.

2) better access to mental health services - I know out city does have services but it still isn’t enough. So many homeless have mental health issues that are not well controlled. Many who have had help have meds are constantly stolen and then they once again are without meds. Others need to work with mental health professionals to simply work through the trams they have been though. 

3) jobs- it sounds easy but is far from it. Many have difficulty even applying for jobs now that applications are primarily online. In addition it is difficult to apply without a primary address and phone number. Even if they get through to an interview it usually doesn’t present well to come in old gross clothes and dirty. Having a [STREET] to clean up and get interview clothes is important. Again, there are some charities that help out but they need to know about them and often the hours are not consistent.


I wish the city could start a tiny house initiative that some other countries have done. They build very simple/utilitarian tiny houses and rent is free. There are conditions to living there but in general they are pretty mild. Usually it is something like: You have to maintain your tiny house. You have to go to mental health appointment. If addicted to drugs you don’t have to be clean but have to be working with a drug treatment program. If you steal from anyone you lose your [STREET]. … rules such as that."

1. It costs less to house a homeless person and provide them with a caseworker than it does to pay for the average cost if they remain homeless (in unpaid medical bills, [STREET] expenses, policing, etc.). So, it is economically more viable to support the homeless community even if they don’t find employment or stay clean or “make good life decisions”. 

Source: [ORGANIZATION], referenced in this article ([URL]

2. The “in general make good life decisions” requirement for helping homeless people is problematic because everyone else has a different metric for what a good life decision is. By allowing these sort of things to make their [STREET] into legal policy we would be disqualifying homeless people from aid for often times arbitrary reasons. Means or ability testing for government aid has always been wildly problematic and unsuccessful. Just look at people on ORG1 who are unable to take better paying jobs because they would loose their health insurance and become financially ruined. Again, housing homeless people saves you money even if they don’t “clean up their act,” so by denying homes to homeless people who can’t work or won’t make the decisions you like you are actually spending money to make their lives worse just because you don’t like their life choices.

3. Painting all homeless people as drug addicted mental health patients is not fair to those who don’t have substance abuse or mental health issues and misrepresents the homeless community. About 30% of homeless people have mental health conditions and about 50% of homeless people have substance abuse problems. While this is higher than the percentages for non-homeless people this is not representative of all homeless people. Calling homeless communities open drug scenes doesn’t help the problem or conform to the reality of the situation. 

Source: [ORGANIZATION] assessment report to [ORGANIZATION].

4. While mental health is seriously underfunded in the [ORGANIZATION] painting this as primarily a mental health issue is not representative of the homeless community. 70% of homeless people do not have serious mental illnesses. This won’t be fixed by approaching it as a mental health issue.

5. There seems to be a misconception that Homeless people don’t work or can’t work. Over half of sheltered homeless people and 40% of unsheltered homeless people have formal employment. It just isn’t enough to afford rising housing costs. 

Source: [URL]

6. It seems wildly unfair to charge homeless people with a greater crime for drug use than a housed person because of their living situation. I agree that drug use should be decriminalized and while making drug use a misdemeanor would be better than a felony I don’t see how charging anyone for non-violent drug crimes helps anyone.

I do want to ask a couple of follow up questions: 

1. What is your solution for homeless people that are unable to meet your standards? Do you want them to be left on the [STREET] to freeze, starve or die of heat exhaustion? 

2. Is the goal of homeless aid to better the public wellbeing or is to hold people accountable for their actions?"

The problem with homelessness is people who wish the problem were simpler to solve then it is. Like the people who comment that we should just give free homes away. First of all, they don’t exist. Second of all, there is no federal or state or local program to just straight up - give away houses, pay their utility bills, and maintain their houses forever. And lastly - it isn’t just a home that is needed, it is utility costs, lawn maintenance, property taxes - all things that add up. It isn’t just a one time lump sum of cash and the problem disappears.

Locally, governments are tapped out. Resource spread thin, and literally, legally, cannot raise taxes more. So questions start to come up like; what do we defund? [INSTITUTION], water department? Can’t do that. The problem needs a federal solution."

What can we do as a community to help our homeless population?,"Here’s my main problem with your message. It’s also painting broad strokes based on one study done in [ORGANIZATION] before the homeless problem really escalated. So citing one study and applying that to the current situation, when more recent studies of the actual encampments particularly [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] are showing much higher rates of drug usage than you’re saying, seems a little misguided.

I appreciate the thoroughness of your response, but I just disagree with a lot of what you’re saying.

1) I agree we need to house them and I understand it costs more in all the unpaid expenses, policing, etc. I agree where it’s more economically viable. I disagree that it’s better for a person to just give them things and expect that to make them better. That just goes against everything I believe and know to be true about human nature. So I guess we agree to disagree. I think if they can’t participate to a set standard of behavior, then they’re on their own and we eat the costs as a society.

2) Again giving people things with no consequences doesn’t solve their problems. A good benchmark is don’t be using, or be in a diversion program if you are, and don’t conduct criminal behavior. Not exactly the highest bar to clear…

3) Disagree that your study is accurately representing the current problem

4) Same as 3 except that I think giving people access to psychological services helps even if you’re not clinically mentally ill. Caseworkers, psychologists and physiatrists are really just people trying to understand people and help give them the tools to better their life. Not really sure why you’d be advocating for less help given the premise of the rest of your arguments.

5) location, location, location. Sure they might work, but can’t afford housing? Yeah, in the most expensive parts of the country where the homeless populations are largest. It’s actually quite affordable when you move out of those areas. Sometimes even [TIME] or two.

6) what would you do then? Have shooting up on the [STREET] amount to a parking ticket that’ll never be paid? The whole point of a misdemeanor is to have it be of consequence enough that the state can intervene and put them into a diversion program without having a felonies on their record that’ll prevent them from ever having full rights and access in our society.

As for your question:

1) I don’t think a one and done system is what I’m advocating for. I know enough people who have recovered or did not recover from drug problems to know the [STREET] to recovery isn’t always a linear progression. There’s a reason these people are on the [STREET], and it’s not easy to undo all those decisions [TIME] without any slip ups. But yes, if you go through a program for idk pick a number, say [PERSON], and you’re still using, or committing crime, or just in general not making any effort whatsoever to try to meet whatever benchmarks are set forth by professional caseworkers, then I’m sorry but you don’t get free things. Unless these people can prove they are literally mentally insane and threat to society, it’s not the states responsibility to solve everyone’s problems, especially people who just don’t want to participate in society.

2) the goal is obviously to better public being via holding people accountable. It’s not an either or, I believe the [STREET] to better public good is to give them support and hold accountable."

What can we do as a community to help our homeless population?,"I don't have time to explain this in depth to you but here's the cliff notes. All I'll say is the war on drugs was created to divide and increase difficulty for the impoverished. Civil rights were empowering the black community and getting them more rights in [ORGANIZATION]. So they flooded the streets with heroin and crack into [LOCATION] then [ORGANIZATION] created the war on drugs to put them in jail for absurd sentences. 25-life for a little weed. They're still in there by the [STREET]. PERSON1 started pardoning some of them finally. The irony of someone serving a sentence for a drug that's now legal. Those people in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], GPE2 aren't pardoned just from the law change, though they should be. So yeah that's your war on drugs in a nutshell. If that's not convincing to you do some research. Stats don't lie. Czech, [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON]. Insane drops in crime and homelessness. And that's what this thread is discussing, correct?

And it makes perfect sense. The homeless and addiction problem has nothing to do with the legalization of weed so let's get that straight. It stems from the opiate epidemic sparked from the oxy contin boom in DATE2. [ORGANIZATION] falsified documents about addiction statistics and incentivised doctors to over prescribe. Then when they got caught and took it away in [LOCATION]. The 3 billion dollar settlement against [ORGANIZATION] only recently finished. And what a joke that was. Just a slap on the wrist and money allocation went back into other big pharma companies. Anyway, after that then GPE6 flooded the dark web with fentanyl and now sells the precursors to the cartel sinc they're better at importing. You legalize it, there goes the black market. There goes the cartel. There goes their numbers since they don't have the money to support the gang. Take away their numbers and the human trafficking and gang wars decrease. That on top of the increase in tax dollars and safe control of the harder drugs. Addicts getting safe drugs without the risk of overdosing. I'm not suggesting they put crack on the store shelves. But a safe and legal medical facility (like they've done in GPE7 as well) to safely get and use clean drugs. These facilities have rules in order to get access to them. And people follow rules to get their drugs. Unlike Methadone clinics and buprenoprphine which isn't effective on a large scale. It does not kill cravings and its harder to get off of. You don't give cake to someone who wants pie. They'll still want the pie. Stupid analogy but whatever. It's true. You get people into these facilities and stop throwing then in jail, you get a decrease in crime, overdoses, incarceration, and increase tax dollars. More tax dollars, more facilities to help the homeless and more resources to PROPERLY battle the addiction epidemic. What we have now doesn't work. It never has. It only fuels division. The thing they didn't plan on is now the rich white kids are homeless addicts too. I've been out in the streets. I fortunately got out. But I know what works and what doesn't. If you don't believe me, then do your research on what the other countries have done."

Some homeless become sober because of the animal.   


The other issue with the shelter is that it doesn't have to follow [ORGANIZATION] criteria for shelters because they are a for profit organization and so they don't have to provide certain things. They also force religion onto people in addition to many of the individuals who have stayed there have been treated very poorly by staff.

While one of the sources I choose was a national report to [ORGANIZATION] from [ORGANIZATION], the other was much more recent (DATE1) and in the context of long term problems like homelessness DATE2 is[LOCATION] that long ago. Additionally, the sources I choose are from reliable government run studies both nationally and focused on an individual state. Keep in mind that large studies like this are done with [ORGANIZATION] in between them. We only do a nation census every DATE2 because gathering large amounts of data on a national scale is difficult.

In contrast the one source that you share “San Fransicko” has a very clear bias. First, one of the self proclaimed goals of the books is to show “How and why,” he wonders, “do progressives ruin cities?” (Quote taken from the ORG1 review of the book, link at the bottom). This is a pretty clear political bias. Additionally, he focuses on one city which has not conformed to national homelessness trends (while homelessness number have fallen nationally they have risen in [ORGANIZATION]). This seems like much shakier ground to stand to base your opinion of all homeless people nationally and solutions to the homelessness problem on.

In response to numbered replies:

1. So, just to be clear, you recognize that it is cheaper to house the homeless than it is to leave them unhoused, but you believe we should leave some people homeless for their own good? Giving shelter to someone who is homeless makes their life significantly better. These are people with no shelter is [PERSON], unreliable food and water sources and no permanent address for receiving mail or to list on job applications. Giving them shelter, food and water solves these problems in a [STREET] that no behavioral incentives will. Again, it costs money to withhold these thing, which are essential to human life, from these people, but you want to just because it goes against what you specifically think about human nature. Human nature requires food, water and shelter before anything else which you, by your own admission, would pay to withhold from people “for their own good”.

2. This seems at direct odd with some of your original claims. You said in your first post that it can be impossible for homeless people to get off drugs, yet you require them to be off drugs or actively trying to get off drugs in order to help them. This “not a high bar to climb” was presented as extremely difficult in your original post.

3 & 4. I believe that the sources I have shared which are national and statewide run investigations into homelessness present a much clearer picture of the problem than the source you shared. Additionally, homelessness numbers have actually dropped nationwide since [ORGANIZATION] by around 20%, so again your source is less representative of the issue.

I am not advocating against improved mental health or drug abuse treatment. I am saying that you are misrepresenting the situation. While improved mental health and drug programs would help the situation there are also other causes of homelessness and it is[LOCATION] the fix you believe it to be.

5. Suggesting that homeless people simply need to move is not a reasonable fix. If they are struggling to survive how do you expect them to move to a new city and leave behind everything they know? How do you expect them to find new employment in more rural areas when they have no home address and there are significantly less job opportunities? How do you expect them to afford transportation?

6. I was pointing out how unfair it is to give different penalties for a crime based on housing situations. Public using should still be illegal, but basing the charge on the housing situation is[LOCATION] a fair position. If a homeless person uses in a private location (safe injection site, friends home, etc.) they should[LOCATION] be punished for it just because they are homeless. Let me know if I have misinterpreted your position here.

Replying to the question responses:

1. The statement “there is a reason these people are on the streets” sheds a lot of light on your opinion of homeless people. Many people become homeless because of medical debt or being laid off or having ptsd from being in the military. Many people are homeless because they were unlucky and did[LOCATION] have a family to support them. And many are homeless because their parent kicked them out of their home. It’s not always bad decisions. Many homeless develop their drug habit in response to their situation instead of it causing their homelessness in the first [STREET]. 

It really seems like you believe that some people are worthy of saving and some people should just roll over and die. This attitude does[LOCATION] solve the homeless problem because some people believe “there is a reason these people are on the streets” and that they deserve to stay there. 

Additionally, you admit that it saves us money to house people even if they nothing to better their situation for themselves. Does[LOCATION] this seem like the exact kind of action the state is supposed to take for betterment of everyone. Saving us money and helping the downtrodden.

2. Holding people accountable for their actions is[LOCATION] the solution to homelessness. They are homeless in the first [STREET] because they have been held accountable for their actions, the actions of others or simply being unlucky. In your original post you said that believing people could just pull themselves up by their bootstraps is not a reasonable position. Why has your stance changed?"

The tag line for the book is “Why progressives ruin cities,” so I don’t think it’s a stretch to say it’s politically motivated.

When your brain is functioning in survival mode, its primary focus is on what it needs to do in order to keep you alive and as stable as you need to be to remain so.

When people come out of their depressive episodes, they often wonder how they let themselves and/or their environment ""get to such a point.

Or maybe there's an individual grieving the recent loss of a loved one who suffers from a compulsive disorder like dermatillomania that you see with many more visible scars and pick marks than usual - or you stop seeing them at all because of the stigma and shame that surrounds their disorder...

All I'm trying to say is that, yes of course, we all want nice clean public areas to enjoy together in an ideal world. But we humans, all of us humans, are not fortunate enough to live in such a world right now, and there are many scientific reasons why picking up trash to deposit in an appropriate [STREET] is not the first thing on an unhoused person's mind-like it may be for you or for me [ORGANIZATION].

I agree these would be the two most nessasary  and beneficial places to use tax money... but to negate the importance of law enforcement is to contradict the desire or a more civil society. It's unfortunate but true. The cities where funding has been cut and forces reduced have seen insane increases in crime....and the courts who hold the same sentiment about incarceration are letting violent theives back on the [STREET] in no time at all. I've experienced and seen this first hand. Maybe it will take, God forbid, such a crime to affect you directly before you might agree. Then you'll have wished there was another police officer on duty who may have helped sooner, or wish the [STREET] would have kept that criminal behind bars for [LOCATION] because not even DATE2 after being let go he did something drastic to someone you care about. I agree there are certain ""crimes"" that should absolutely have the consequences altered to something less harsh then being incarcerated for extend3d periods of time, but not for crime across the board like what is happening in left ran cities.
And the amount of taxation we are subject to is absolutley ridiculous...Look at retirement accounts in which a majority of them has your money taxed prior to going in one, and then of course taxed again when it's time to take it out... not to mention you're forced to keep it in the account unless you want to suffer high fees for just wanting or needing to use your own money. That sounds like theft by use of an entities power over an individual. Something like the mob. Especially when you consider how much government personnel wages have increased over [ORGANIZATION]. Maybe if most of the Mr. and Mrs. [PERSON] weren't making high 6, or up to 7 figures a year, taxes could be lowered and more could be used for things that would benefit all the folks whose money is being used for all these things in the first [STREET]...like their children's education, or the roads they [STREET] on to their [STREET] of work, where they have to go to make sure they are giving the government  their ""fair"" share....
And also...not all, but a good majority of the homeless are drug addicts who do not work, and do not want to utilize help that people are already kindly offering them. That's reality, not biased thinking by a certain group of people. Only a naive idiot would say otherwise... It may not be someone's fault they ended up homeless because of uncontrollable or overbearing circumstances they endured...but there's a reason a person stays in that position for an extended period of time...and that is their choice.. if nothing else there are shelters they could stay in. But many don't want to abide to the structure and requirements put in [STREET] at the shelters. They would rather be on the [STREET] doing what they do. That is what it is. Many like you have good intentions, but are unfortunatley gullible and will be taken advantage of and just end up enabling  and catering to true problem causing individuals."

1. Attending a housing conference in [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION] and meeting a stranger from [PERSON].

It’s certainly an oft repeated narrative based on anecdotes that are repeated among people, but this is also a narrative that virtually every other city tells about themselves.

The research done in other places has shown that the majority of people experiencing homelessness in a given city are from the region (from that city and the surrounding suburbs, exurbs, and/or rural areas) but there are always some portion who migrate to that city because they either had family or some other connection to the city that led them to hope things would be better there or because they heard there were more resources/opportunities. Keep in mind, that’s one of the biggest reasons people with more economic means move too! 

Many people having a hard time in one [STREET] are going to migrate to different places to try to start fresh. Most of them have enough to get housing in that new city, so we don’t think of those moves in the same [STREET].

The other thing that I think is rarely considered is that some people are also leaving the city, but they are never considered. People get those one [STREET] bus tickets going out of the city too. What is the net population shift? I don’t pretend to know.

The fallacy that really pisses me off is that a rise in the number of people experiencing homelessness in [ORGANIZATION] is just more people coming from out of town. [PERSON] is on the rise across most of the country for a number of factors (the biggest of which is housing affordability). Saying the [ORGANIZATION] went up, ergo they all just came on the bus, is just stupid."

[ORGANIZATION], for example, is not available to LGBTQ+ folks, and also men have to stay separately from their partner/spouse/family, which makes it difficult for disabled folks who have support needs."

I'll do these two together, because IF you were correct about the second part, the first part would be an understandable position to take.  That said, I don't think anyone here is hating on the homeless, they generally want the people to get help, even if they don't know the best [STREET] for that to be done.

\>If you are so aware of the homeless why don't you help them?

  
This goes back to your definition of help.  We can feed them and we can offer them beds, but that is a short term solution that will will never resolve the problem.  I am with you, 100%, that we need to make sure people have food and shelter, the form that help takes though MUST include a plan to actually help these people long term.



\>You can donate to the resources mentioned in the article.

  
Yes!!! But those donations pale in comparison to the value of applying political pressure to actually solve the problems of mental illness and addiction.  Despite what many people here may believe, the overwhelming majority of the homeless are addicts and/or mentally ill.  MOST of these people can be brought to a level where they can function in society, but it will require nonconsensual custodial activity that will benefit them, but will also be met with resistance from [ORGANIZATION] local hand wringers whining about ""it's their choice to do drugs and not treat their mental illness"".

\>Don't have the money?

\>Volunteer. Take your family to [ORGANIZATION] and volunteer [ORGANIZATION]



I would encourage people to volunteer, and while [PERSON] is important, a better message would be to call and ask the local shelters what day or [DATE] they actually need the help, rather than end up with more volunteers on a specific holiday and nobody during DATE2.

The problem is that we don’t have a coordinated effort that addresses the things that cause homelessness, like substance abuse, transportation, mental health, jobs, etc. (Yes, I know those things exist here. Coordinated efforts look totally different than just having services.)

If you want a local example of what effective service delivery would look like, look at the [ORGANIZATION]. The residents there are at high risk of being homeless; most have been homeless in the past. In order to live there they have to meet criteria: be engaged in authorized services including case management and meet standards for compliance with the rules in the building. With all of the homelessness, crime and drugs around in proximity to that [STREET], they have not a ton of problems with it and their residents stay housed there because there are coordinated efforts to keep them safe, supported, and housed. There is a TON of help in [STREET] to help them meet their needs and support their safe housing. The services are what keep them housed, not the buildings that they live in. 

Those supports and services are scalable, but they need to be coordinated in order to be effective. That is a totally different issue than housing and can’t reasonably be implemented at the service delivery level.

I personally know at least one person in [ORGANIZATION] that was a literal slave in [PERSON] and is now a prominent business owner in the area. There needs to be carrots and sticks in [STREET]. It is immoral to allow these camps to continue, and that means making it illegal to camp on public property inside the county outside of designated camp grounds. People are not flourishing in these camps and there has been violence and death. Not to mention the sanitary conditions or littering. People overdosing and living an addicts life in squalor is not preferable to jailing. What we also need in conjunction with these measures are options. We can 100% offer opportunities to stay in shelters as opposed to jailing. To then transition to some form of independent subsidized housing, people need to be required to make positive changes in their lives, such as sobriety. Offering free housing without enforcing any type of conditionality will just create new issues. Altruism can become pathological, and you can destroy peoples lives by offering them too much. PERSON0 just wrote a book called “[LOCATION] sicko” about this very subject and it highlights how endless compassion isn’t the answer.

Tax rates for the wealthy are going down, not up. As you've seen in [ORGANIZATION] now, passing anything, even with democrats in power, is nearly impossible.

People always have simple answers to big problems, and these simple answers solve none of the problems. It is actually.... probably the saddest thing I've witnessed, in general over my life. 

We've said we would solve so much. Climate change, gun violence, equality, social mobility - and we've made zero progress on any of these. We've made negative progress, even. We can't even legalize marijuana at the federal level. 

Here's a simple solution to solving climate change; just do it. Just do it. Easy, right?

People on this subreddit keep asking the same questions, and providing the same simple answers. And yet they are amazed that they are unsatisfied with the results. Here's what the people asking these questions don't want to hear; invite the homeless in to your house. Or take your paycheck, and buy a house for the homeless person, or buy the homeless person a [ORGANIZATION] at a hotel. These are actual solutions that any of us can do.

Basically - a series of (forced) corrective actions that some people will strongly resist. This heavy handed approach takes over a persons life - and removes a bit of their sense of agency. But it attempts to put people in to a more prescriptive program - where success is forced.

It's tricky. This blog is interesting and talked about it in [ORGANIZATION], and I think there's some important distinctions. 

>Some thoughts below. My background: [ORGANIZATION] resident for [ORGANIZATION], frequent visitor for [LOCATION] before that. Spent DATE2 [PERSON] doing [ORGANIZATION] food distribution to homeless in southern [PERSON].  
>  
>There are (at least) three ""sub-classes"" of homeless and confusing or conflating them results in total confusion regarding solutions.  
>  
>A. Subclass A are the ""lifestyle homeless"". Vagabonds, drifters, gutter punks, [STREET] musicians, beach bums, craft stall vendors, ""[PERSON] lifers"". A number of these folks I know by name, and consider to be friends. They could hold straight jobs in theory, and often come from more conventional backgrounds. The tradeoffs inherent in living the straight-and-narrow are too much, and they cannot or will not do it. Sometimes drugs and mental illness are an issue, but not overwhelmingly so.  
>  
>B. Subclass B are the ""down on their luck homeless"". Living in car, [PERSON], or [LOCATION] temporarily due to job loss, bills, bad luck, or poor choices coupled to above. Will actively seek out shelter, come to social services and adhere to plans to improve the situation. Aiming to get back on their feet. Overwhelmingly working class and not happy or proud of their current condition.  
>  
>C. Subclass C are the ""wretched homeless"". Sorry about the moniker but it fits. Extreme mental illness or drug addiction. Limited ability or agency. Suffering in many dimensions. Selling body for drugs. Crime and violence -- both perpetrators and victims. Passed out on [STREET] in own fluids. These cases are extremely sad, and my heart breaks for them. A test: if you ask them their name or their story, you most often cannot get any kind of comprehensible reply.  
>  
>The wretched homeless are the ones that are most obvious in many ways, and seemingly what the book focuses on. They will not be helped by marginal changes in housing markets: rents dropping from $1500/mo to $1250/mo are not their issue. On the other hand, the ""down on their luck"" \*WILL\* be helped, and mightily so, by more affordable housing and/or social programs. [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] of working class job offshoring are reasonable causes.  
>  
>Class C cannot be divorced, in any [STREET], from changes in mental health policies, nor from the flood of ever-stronger drugs in [ORGANIZATION]. Drug induced psychosis and/or willingness to do almost anything for the next hit create a massive hole that is very very very hard to pull out of. Many (most?) die in that condition. Jail seems to be the only circuit breaker we have in the current system, and it does a poor job of interrupting the cycle.  
>  
>In the [PERSON] of my experience, the problem in [LOCATION] has gotten much worse. Some areas have improved (as I recall LOC2 was very intense with heroin on the [STREET] in [LOCATION]). Both classes B and C seem to be much larger overall.  
>  
>A major concern is preventing lifestyle and down-on-their-luck from becoming wretched. That is, how can we stop class A and B from becoming class C? Another major concern is tailoring programs and help to fit the person. A wretched homeless selling their body and dignity for the next hit is NOT going to fill out your paperwork, and will scare or harm others in a shelter.  
>  
>I think this review is too hard on [ORGANIZATION]. He seems to grasp realities of the problem that are glossed over by the homeless-industrial-complex.

I think this is pretty important distinction for any homeless discourse."

Good question though. I moved here from [ORGANIZATION] specifically because it is so much more affordable here. I make the same wages I did in [ORGANIZATION], and can afford much more here in [PERSON]. At the same time, I see [STREET] more homeless people here in [PERSON] than I did in [ORGANIZATION] which was a much higher cost of living where I’m from. Granted, I’m from a rural area of GPE2 near the ocean. I was also homeless in [ORGANIZATION]. 

My assumption is that homeless people gather where the most resources are located. [PERSON] has a lot of resources where as my rural area of [ORGANIZATION] did not, so homeless people there would travel to the cities like [PERSON], [PERSON], or GPE6."

Can you pay your phone bill, car payment, electricity, gas, and groceries with $148?


It's simple math. The cost of living is higher than the amount a worker is compensated for their labor. Homeless people are not villains. They are people who need help and we refuse (as a society) to help them. 

Then some people have the nerve to blame the few people who do bother to help ([ORGANIZATION]) for causing the problem. Shame on you.

The answer is affordable housing and a living wage.

We should start with banning corporations from owning housing and creating artificial scarcity to [STREET] up the cost of rent. 

We should also demand that any employer be required to pay an actual living wage for any work that is done at their business. The argument that some work doesn't *deserve* a living wage is despicable nonsense. How dare you? If work produces profit, that work should be compensated with a living wage."

So [ORGANIZATION] when we had the ""Issue"" at FAC0 downtown the local news interviewed a few of the Homeless down there, most of them just had bad luck and most of them were not native to the area. Homeless people leave areas where they don't have resources survive like a [STREET] to panhandle, a [INSTITUTION], budlings to use as shelter, etc. Also, other counties, cities and states do make homelessness more difficult with structures designed to harm them or benches with spikes, etc. Homeless people go where they can survive, that is why they don't go out into the country, suburbs or Republican counties in general.

I agree that the cost of living here is far better than [PERSON], especially near GPE2 or [PERSON]. Even [ORGANIZATION] can be expensive, the closer you get to GPE4. 

I think another factor is that there are simply more jobs opportunities in high-cost of living areas, so it's a little easier to eek by. Whereas [PERSON], while not economically depressed, simply has few jobs on the whole available. 

And like you mentioned, the support services available here are probably a little better and/or accessible than surrounding communities, like GPE6 or GPE7. Unfortunately, I don't see the problem getting better over time, especially given how homelessness is becoming a larger problem everywhere."

Also, there really is no reason for anyone to sleep on the [STREET].  Especially in DATE0.   There are plenty of available beds at [ORGANIZATION] and other shelters.  Many sleeping on the [STREET] choose to do so because they don't want to follow the rules of no fighting, no drinking and no drugs.  So they'd rather be on the [STREET].

At a 15% tax rate for this low income the $2400 take home pay becomes $2050. A 3 bed house in the vine rents for $1600, assume $1900 with utilities. That is $633. 

$2050-$633 = $1377. 
Looking online, self provided healthcare is running about $600/ month in [ORGANIZATION], leaving $777 for personal expenses, or $25 per day, or $8.35 per meal. 

Is this an amazing life? Not quite. Could a person of sound mind probably up that to wage to $18 with some job hunting? Probably. There is another $3*160 = $480 per month of income. 

We live in a fairly affordable city. I think childcare, job training for mobility, and affordable healthcare are key issues to tackle. 

I think ""of sound mental health"" is a major issue for these vulnerable communities and probably a good start to tackle the problem. Affordable housing for those who want to buy is also very important.... which comes from adequate housing supply built by skilled labor. 

How do we [PERSON] up the pipeline to skilled trades to get people building houses and making a great wage doing so? How do we support vulnerable communities with effective intervention for mental health and the often overlapping addiction issues? These are the questions we may want to focus on."

This is poor methodology. Average income should be compared to average cost of a 1 bedroom unit. Minimum wage should be compared to minimum cost of a 1 bedroom unit, or some well-defined surrogate such as the 5th percentile. 


[ORGANIZATION] provides the [ORGANIZATION] medians for DATE1 household income, per capita income, selected [ORGANIZATION] owner costs, gross rent as $61,739, $34,928, $560-1389, and $891, respectively. People earning $20,000 (approx. min. wage), $34,928, and $61,739/yr should not be targeting the same housing expenses. 

What separates me from a homeless person are circumstances and decisions. Both of which play equally critical roles.  
I lived with no savings off of $16,000 a year [PERSON]. This was possible in part because I had an establishment upbringing (favorable circumstances), and in part because I sought housing that made sense for my income bracket (made good decisions). When thinking about poverty risk we can consider circumstances and decision making to be major points of entry. This is true everywhere; I think even though your fiscal analysis is flawed your conclusion is still mostly how I see it. It is a fiscal imbalance in the valuation of labor and cost of needs which precipitates poverty. This, however, does not provide [ORGANIZATION] with an answer to their question. 

[ORGANIZATION] is asking why the population is concentrating in [PERSON] over [PERSON]. And the reason for that does indeed involve the services rendered to homeless people in [PERSON] and the [STREET] the sheltered residents feel about homeless people.  They go where there are resources available and the culture is tolerate of their integration. [PERSON] 100 % has an increasing homeless population because of the resources the homeless people can acquire and the sheltered residents lack of repulsion. Neither of these are necessarily bad things to have, but facts, they are indeed to blame for the uptick. 

This is not too different from the phenomena of homeless people migrating towards southern GPE2. [PERSON] is an incredible [STREET] to live, whether you’re housed or not. You can sleep outside [DATE] round. The culture there is very tolerant of homelessness, and they have above average resources available there. This why they have a ton of homeless people. 

I’d argue that [PERSON] is likely one of the best places for homeless people in the [ORGANIZATION] because of the exceptionally cheap housing opportunities. The lower the housing costs, the higher the likelihood that someone trying to get off the streets can actually make that leap. Any homeless person in the greater vicinity would be foolish not to come to [PERSON]. It’s a real shot at getting up again. And if you fail, there are above average support mechanisms in [STREET] to float you along. 
I don’t get why people need to be so dogmatic and defensive about this. You made progressive changes to the society to help out the destitute and the destitute came for help. It’s not mass spectrometry in outer space, [ORGANIZATION] based assay development, rocket science, or even accounting. You can be proud of the opportunities and outreach and still acknowledge that your efforts have second order effects that may someday require management.

[PERSON] has lost a lot of it’s luster. So many other things to blame aside from the occasional homeless person IMO. But, the homeless population there has long included individuals who harm a portion of our economy by creating large amounts of discomfort in the shopping areas.  When individuals are roaming into restaurants and businesses to panhandle without some mechanism to disincentivize, you can expect to lose tourism. When homeless people follow you home in the dark and start demanding you feed them in your home, you will lose residents. Lose too much revenue, lose residents, lose too many residents, lose tax income and organizational support, lose those and you no longer can afford to assist the destitute people. The second order effects need to be balanced.


Once again, just want to clarify via illustration that there is no reason someone making minimum wage should be targeting something that costs over $1000 per month per bedroom. [PERSON] is overflowing with listings like these:

Restrictive zoning is not what is holding back affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION].  


New construction affordable housing, in the private market, without government subsidies, doesn't exist. It's not possible to exist. The cost to build, even with the greatest economies of scale and building a large multi-unit made possible with no zoning problems, is simply too high. That's just the math of it. You can't build a new building and charge affordable rents.   


So, new affordable housing only exists with subsidies. Local government, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], or Low Income Housing Tax Credits. These sources are all limited, and only result in so many projects [DATE] and most of those projects took [ORGANIZATION] to put together and finally get all of the gap financing needed to make SOME of the units affordable.

We all preach how it is unfortunate that [ORGANIZATION] has a homeless problem - and that we want the people to have a better option. But none of us are willing to make that better option a reality. So we’re stuck in this endless cycle where nothing gets done"

I work with the homeless population on a [DATE] basis. Some of them have some sever mental disorders, others have drug issues, others have violence issues.  Others are the kindness nicest people in the world.

Yes our society has massively let them down and I want them housed as well.

But stop pretending you would be ok with a homeless camp near your house, there is rampant drug trading and usage in the open, lots of needles left around, plenty of prostitution and indecent exposure to the public. And lots and lots of violence.

We need to do better to get these peoole the help they need, because that's what they are, people. But it doesn't mean it's safe or ok for them to camp anywhere they want and essentially trash that area.

So yes, they can't live near public or private housing and businesses. Instead of trying to call people out for being uncomfortable about living near these camps. We need to be focusing our energy on providing more.

But more so on that point we need to get our neighboring cities to stop sending their homeless to us on the bus and start providing as much as [ORGANIZATION] does to the homeless.

We have a metric ton of shelters, kitchens and health programs to help these people. Not all of them take advantage of it and not all of them safely can interact with the people who run them.

It's a much larger issue then ""o yes i would totally be ok with them living near me"" because that's total horse shit and doesn't resolve the issue."

 That cannabis companies get no tax breaks is very common knowledge due to it being federally illegal [LOCATION]* or that cannabis had a stigmata for [ORGANIZATION] and most local  cannabis owners don't trust the police or that most local cannabis businesses help the community including the homeless?
In the newspaper online articles and witnessing it with our own two eyes.
 Examples: other local cannabis businesses in other areas [ORGANIZATION] would have collapsed not for [ORGANIZATION] in [PERSON] and all the other local people standing up and donating upon donating time energy and money to provide clean water and help their school when no one else would. GPE2 with cannabis is becoming an entirely new city.

I also wonder how much time you've spent in the camps personally, because they're nowhere near as bad as what you're painting them to be.

I've seen people get heated and the community come together to deescalate. I've seen people cooperating to build a shared community to meet their needs that aren't being met by city and nonprofit services.

Sure, maybe lots of people wouldn't want homeless people living next to them, but lots of people just outright hate or fear our homeless neighbors regardless, so there's nothing novel about that. Unless we drastically retool our society and seize power from the ownership class, more and more people are going to end up on the streets. And if it happened to you wouldn't you prefer to be treated in a humane and dignified manner by your community?"

Are you fucking serious?

They're only good enough to invite to camp in your yard?  And you think you're the compassionate one.  Here's an old ""joke"".

A man driving down the [STREET] sees a homeless man eating grass on the side of the freeway, he stops and says to the homeless man "" You don't have to eat dirty grass on the side of the freeway to stay alive, hop in my car, I'll take you to my home"".

The homeless man gets in and is driven to the man's home.  As soon as he gets out the man says to the homeless man "" Here is my lawn, eat all the clean grass you want.""


You're the asshole in the car."

The [ORGANIZATION] budget for [ORGANIZATION] was like 250 million dollars. So [PERSON] or DATE2 budget- with some inflation - is going to be like 300 million dollars. 

40mn is a great gift. With so many competing priorities; it is tough for city officials. Have you considered what it takes to “just have the government build some housing and hand the keys to homeless people”? Not only does the city need to find a neighborhood who will allow this ([ORGANIZATION]), but the individual receiving the house will need to maintain the house until….their death. Many of these people do not have income. This means the city is not only on the hook for procuring land, construction labor, construction materials; but also the property taxes, utilities, maintenance, yard work, and repairs. The [PERSON] government has a housing program to approach this issue - its the section [ADDRESS] to maintain, low population density everywhere, taxes that are too low - City of [ORGANIZATION] is going to use that [PERSON] on the basic necessities that we’re already foregoing."
49,2021-10-14 12:15:24 UTC,4,2021-10-14 17:54:10 UTC,[ORGANIZATION] on Stadium,"It is a complicated problem, as you point out. It isn’t just costs related to housing that has to be considered; but also the costs related to mental health, physical health, transportation, [ORGANIZATION], and…well - everything that you or I work to pay for.

Everyone of these people have unique circumstances - some of them might claim they cannot work at all, or some of them might be able to work some, and some of them might be able to work - but still fall short of affording basic essentials. So the financial cost is….massive. I cannot imagine how to budget for this - especially at the local level. The initial construction costs could be the smallest - with the recurring costs being even larger.

All this to say - it is complicated. I don’t see many people with solutions. The easiest solution seems to be if [ORGANIZATION] offers grants for (or otherwise subsidizes) section 8 housing. Then if the section 8 housing program was expanded, more people would be eligible. It is a system that appears to work. Naturally, it seems the easiest [STREET] to reduce homelessness, and provide housing - without the government having to massively increase taxes.

There is something to be said for how society treats its poor and homeless. Everything has gotten so.expensive; that doing anything - and trying to solve anything, seems to cost millions - tens of millions, hundreds of millions - and billions…in no time.

Cities, unlike the federal government, have to balance their budgets. Cities literally declare bankruptcy if they can’t service their debt. Underfunded pension liabilities, endless [STREET] maintenance costs - these issues are just massive. Not to mention all the aging infrastructure that isn’t a [STREET] (like bridges, water treatment plants, waste treatment plants, pump stations, water pipes). A lot of cities are having to make hard choices on the basic essentials for their own tax paying residents. 

Not sure how all this is fixed……"
49,2021-10-14 12:15:24 UTC,0,2021-10-14 18:09:53 UTC,[ORGANIZATION] on Stadium,"We did. But it is a drop in the bucket of what is necessary to eliminate, or even reduce these homeless camps."
49,2021-10-14 12:15:24 UTC,2,2021-10-16 19:31:29 UTC,[ORGANIZATION] on Stadium,"So when you say you will pay taxes so the government can provide housing for the homeless; would you be okay with the homeless people being housed next door to you? Let's say the government wanted to build some project housing for the homeless, and give them just enough to get by. 


This is yet another dilemma. Not only are people unwilling to take homeless people in to their own house, but they don't support housing them nextdoor, or in their neighborhood. Basically, anything that could pose a risk to their children, spouse, or housing value...is not going to be supported. 

People know what happens to the neighborhoods that invite project housing in. Everyone that is homeless is not a murderer, but a not insignificant percentage are involved in criminal activity - or undesirable activity. 

This argument is an attempt to seriously, and creatively think of the issue, and how we could address it. Where can we find a community of people willing to let homeless people without any income live in project style housing? 

I don't think we can find a neighborhood that generous; as a result, I am at a loss for solutions. Even expanding section 8 housing won't solve the problem."

Not including all the churches that do out reach or the donation drives and people dropping off clothes and food and what not.

I'm not sure how as a social worker your missing all the out reach programs out there that our social workers at the hospital deal with. But uh...yea.

Not to mention the fact that other cities send their homeless here is another big indicator. [ORGANIZATION] is litterally known for its homeless assistance programs. It's why we have such a disproportionate amount of homeless comparatively."

I'll admit ill never give rhem money but I've bought many a corner sitter food if they say they are hungry. Hell half the time I know them from the hospital.

But there are extremes in both directions and in all honesty the encampment and the random locations cause more harm then good.

My wife worked for the shelter for a while and the biggest reason people don't stay at the shelters is because either they where kicked put for poor behavior or they choose not to for one reason or another, but typically drug use. 

But we need free counseling, drug therapy and job aid as well as temp housing. But you could offer all these things and some people would still refuse because addiction is a hell of a thing to deal with and not everyone is able to be helped on their own free will.

There is a lot I wish we could do. And should actively work towards. But it doesn't change what needs to be done now."

Everyone says we should; but I'm like....okay, how? 

Do we just... indefinitely raise taxes to pay for homes of these people? What kind of homes should these be? And when does ""providing housing"" become housing projects that breed crime? 

How do we ensure this is a success? I'm afraid that even if we built an apartment complex, it would turn in to poverty stricken project housing in no time.and then because of mental illness and lack of incomes; the housing would just be destroyed - or not maintained. When someone dies in these housing projects; who pays for the carpet to get replaced? Do the taxpayers pay for that, too?

I absolutely love the overall idea; provide housing for homeless. But when it comes to execution; I have never heard anything that explains it.

I get what you mean; you can’t turn a bedroom in your apartment in to a 10 person homeless camp.

IF….people were willing to take homeless people in; homeless people would be…well, not homeless? They could have compassion, care, food, warmth. This could be homeowners, it could be renters - we just need people to take them in.

And then the other problem; we just need people to save all their life…to put 20% down on their dream home….and then also want homeless people with no income to be given housing right next to the people who saved their whole life - for the biggest purchase they will make in their life. No one wants this. No one wants to live next to homeless people with no income. It is sad."

[PERSON] is at record prices. Construction labor has never been more expensive. Capital goods are not becoming cheaper to produce. 

Inflation, input costs, and labor all add up to make an incredibly difficult housing situation for those making poverty wages, or recovering from bad choices in life. 

Housing prices in [ORGANIZATION] have been relatively affordable (and still continue to be...when reviewing national averages), and outsourcing production of consumer goods to third world countries has hidden this housing problem. Your rent goes up $50; but....you can still buy a $59 smartphone, a ten pack of socks for $7, a big screen TV for $199, and so on. That hides the problem, until the problem becomes too large, that even consumer goods produced by people who make $2/day, in factories that have zero pollution control or waste disposal will only go so far. 

Then add in the fact that more and more Americans depend on these low-skill service industry jobs that pay $10-11/hr - and the housing crisis becomes a slow moving trainwreck. 

We either need to lower input costs, convince construction workers to work for free (sarcasm), convince construction workers to work for less (or....automate their jobs to lower labor costs), or increase the minimum wage.

The world is so flat in [ORGANIZATION], that tech workers hoping to make six figures are competing with citizens from [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], and Baltic states - who will gladly work for $15k USD/yr. Manufacturing workers are competing with frontier economies that have zero regulations for child labor or pollution. HR staff are competing with Philippino workers. Philippino workers are competing with chat-bots / voice recognition call center software - which reduce the staff needed to support a brand.

Junkies and the mentally ill make up 90% of the homeless population.  You cannot give them a home a d call it ""job done"".  They need to be treated and cared for around the clock until hopefully some (but sadly not a majority) will be able to function in society again with less supervision.

The next group is a collection of two groups, temporarily homeless who through circumstances (domestic violence, younger adult kicked out of family home, lost job and no family nearby, etc) and families that lost a breadwinner (loss of life, took off, ended up in prison) or the breadwinner lost their job and doesn't have many options.

They're not drug addicts, they're not insane, and they have ID's and functioning brains.

Nothing about how they’re obtained, who owns them, or how we would go about it without either violating rights or implementing eminent domain.

Your argument isn't wrong, but it is incomplete and needlessly invites challenge.  We've already decided as a nation that eminent domain exists for the betterment of society.  We have likewise concluded that large gatherings of mentally ill addicts is a net negative to society at large.  Any mal intentioned debater could easily argue against the points you made.

Look deeper to better understand what you are observing. 

You are using the term homeless to describe a group of people and concluding that all of the individuals in the group are the same AND that they are all victims of a system. There probably are some of these individuals who are good people who just had bad luck and insufficient support from their communities. There are also some who had lots of support and are now residing in places like the camps you’ve described. 

So how did everyone involved get to where they are [ORGANIZATION]? And more importantly, and at the heart of what you are saying, how can we show empathy, compassion, and prevent unnecessary suffering?

Our community does a lot in an effort to help. People donate food, time, money, and other resources. Organizations offer shelter, clothing, food, and assistance that can enable individuals to not live outdoors and to also become financially independent. Some of the people living in the camps you described have accepted this help. Those are the success stories that get less attention. One of the leaders who manages the [ORGANIZATION] kitchen that feeds the homeless will tell you that he was once homeless himself. He received help and is no longer homeless. So, there are actually some wins happening — it’s not all evil landlords and government oppressing helpless victims. 

One might say, do more of what works. Fund it, scale it up, “solve” this “problem.” There have been increases in community support. People in the community have stepped up and done more. Maybe we could get some smart people together who could develop a detailed plan and budget, they could include the “homeless” in the conversation — and collaboratively develop an approach that could begin to further reduce the number of individuals living outdoors and in camps.  

This may sound good and hopeful. But, what do you do about those in the community who don’t want to do this. In addition, what do you do about the “homeless” individuals who also don’t want to do what we’ve described here. There are people on both sides who are practicing their personal freedoms. It’s a conundrum. Do you respect the freedom and choices of others, or do you begin to set limits and standards?

The community has established rules, ordinances, laws, and systems to maintain some level of civilization and equity. There is no perfect solution or combination of rules — but, some amount provides a sense of balance and fairness. 

We’ve read in the news about fires, explosions, rapes, and assaults happening in local “homeless” camps. It’s a sad state of affairs. Some sensational statements made by camp residents have also been shared by the press. The picture that this aspect of the camps generates is one where many individuals don’t want the community’s help. Or, that they want the help, but on their own terms. For example, being able to stay in a shelter while having the freedom to not follow any rules and standards set by the shelter — like no drugs, alcohol, fighting, etc. 

What we are observing in our community is a complex and challenging problem. There are some who will help. There are individuals who want to or can be convinced to receive help. Then there is what remains. Ranting to an online community may be therapeutic or feel like the right thing to do. But it doesn’t make the hard problems any easier to solve."

They need housing. But housing isn’t enough. Just providing housing isn’t going to mean anything if they don’t have the skills and the means to live independently and maintain that housing.

Mental health support is meaningless without housing, and if that support isn’t flexible enough to work with each individual’s needs. Someone with PTSD and a substance use disorder that is focused on alcohol is going to need different kind of supports than someone with borderline personality disorder and a substance use disorder focused on marijuana. Different abilities come into play as well. This person with [ORGANIZATION] may be more capable of handling social situations than that person with [ORGANIZATION]. We need to provide individualized mental health services and substance use programs that work for individuals, because one size fits all doesn’t really fit anyone. That’s why we have such low retention rates in so many of the existing programs.

We also need to address the fact that many of the existing programs rob homeless folks of their abilities to make decisions for themselves. They can only go to the mission if they agree to follow their religious rules.

They can only go to these programs if they agree to these curfews.

We also need to address the rampant racism and sexual assault that happens in a lot of these shelters — it’s obscene how many stories you hear. Having been homeless in [ORGANIZATION], I can flat out tell you that the mission is awful. I slept there a few times, and frankly, the sexual assaults I experienced or witnessed just weren’t worth it. Especially when it was perpetrated by the staff.

You experience a lot of [ORGANIZATION] on the streets but at least when you’re sleeping rough you can fight back some. Or you can walk away and find somewhere else to sleep sometimes. 

You can’t resolve homelessness with single solutions, you need a larger scale effort of multiple community based actions working toward the same goal from different angles. You need trauma informed care, mutual aid, and actual respect.

Unfortunately, [ORGANIZATION]’s only interested in bandaid publicity oriented solutions like the pods or the [ORGANIZATION] remodel. Those of us on the ground doing the work knew that it was never going to amount to anything, but here we are, going into [ORGANIZATION], with cops still evicting and literally pissing on homeless encampments and no actually useful steps being taken to support anyone.

The ROI is a healthy and functional populace which can then fill the jobs that capitalist institutions need to have filled in order to run their profit-generating infrastructure. The ROI is a productive workforce.

Is it more expensive? Yes! It turns out it is expensive to maintain the habitats we’ve created for ourselves! But that expense pays for healthy people who can have healthy families. Healthy families produce healthy workers, and healthy workers guarantee the maintenance of capitalist infrastructure.

Your attempt at a compromise here (it takes [ORGANIZATION] to really get back on your feet, dependent upon circumstances) is quite literally a capitalist attempt to cannibalize itself to generate another dollar in its [ORGANIZATION]-like consumption.

This is quite literally a thing that should be solved on a state level, because as you point out, the local level doesn’t have the power to pass a tax which could improve our local education system.

Because lets acknowledge that if [ORGANIZATION] is experiencing a homelessness problem, its more than possible the rest of the state will see the same soon, if they’re not already seeing it now. And this points at a future issue as we also continue to pay for the consequences of climate change on our state; an increasing influx of people fleeing places that will become inhospitable for the [PERSON] region. A comprehensive infrastructure proposal like this is preparation for more people moving to the state, as well as a draw.

Republicans wont agree to this no matter what the financing looks like because poor = bad and undesirable and the ultimate conclusion to the republican platform is that the bad and undesirable die.

Bitch the fuck u mean. Raising taxes in order to pay for infrastructure construction requires time not only for taxes to be collected, but for the infrastructure to be built. You’re actively sitting here acting as if these efforts should wipe away the issue with a stroke of the pen, and I’m telling you that these systems need not only time to be constructed but also to begin to address the issue.

You’re overly concerned with cost when it is actively costing more to keep people on the [STREET] and out of shelters. Your concerns are, overall, individualistic and your handwringing undermines the confidence in these efforts that is necessary to ensure their completion and follow-through. A societal problem’s cost *must* be borne by the entire society, and if your concern is “people dont want to pay taxes” then you’re really not contributing anything to the discussion.

There is not, actually, a finite amount of money. Money, as a social construct, is basically infinite, and the only thing that truly effects the value of the pieces of paper in your pocket or the numbers in your banking app is trust within the constructed system that tells you what the value of those things are by arbitrarily controlling the amount of those dollars in circulation. The actual real value of shelter is unquantifiable. You can tell me a quantification of its value, but that is ultimately a subjective and arbitrary valuation. You can tell me an empty house is worth $350,000 but if its not being used to house anyone, it has essentially the same value as [ORGANIZATION].

The economic arguments really do come down to “it is cheaper to provide housing and healthcare with no expectation of those it is provided to than to maintain an impoverished class of people which has negative effects on societal health and economic value.” I actually don’t really give a fuck about where the money comes from, because its all made up anyway. If we just said “the money sitting in off shore tax havens is no longer legal tender” we’d decimate market values but we’d also have a reason to [STREET] inflation down massively through that arbitrary decision."

If one can grow or shrink the available supply of a resource arbitrarily with extremely little labor, then what value does that resource actually have?

You’re busy harping on about neoliberal monetary policy and bemoaning the fact that fascists would rather poor people die of exposure than scratch off a check which ultimately saves their economic institutions a non-insignificant amount of money by the mere fact its cheaper to put up houses and put people in them than it is to leave them on the [STREET].

I don’t know why you think a [ORGANIZATION] and a ORG1 are in the same category of good. It shows me that you’re not actually taking the analysis I’m giving you seriously, given that shelter is a necessity and a [ORGANIZATION] is a luxury.

And no, it really is simple once you work past the barriers of political opposition and you exercise state authoritarian power in the effort to improve the lives of the citizenry. You want to make it complicated by throwing wrenches into the gears of the apparatus when the apparatus itself was constructed specifically to maintain a structure of power which keeps homeless people homeless. When political will exists for an effort or policy, it turns out that its actually very easy to get those policies enacted. We’re talking about a policy who the powerful and the rich do not want to put political support behind because it actively negatively impacts their economic self interest in the short term, because the money *does* need to come from the wealthy, by simple fact that they have the resources to spare.

If you argue the fine print is where problems are solved, I’ll argue that the fine print is also where a number of problems arise. [PERSON] are in the fine print, as well as smoothing actions to account for potential unseen consequences. If you want to argue that it takes incrementalism to solve large issues, then you actually have to have the political balls to take a first step and bloody the nose of anyone who wants to get in your [STREET].

You think I’m armchair quarterbacking, but you’re in the La-Z-Boy right next to me lmao. You’re layering just as much disrespect to the people suffering these circumstances by hemming and hawwing the (very obvious) solutions and actions that need to be taken. Society *can* and *has* provided shelter, food, and water free of cost to its members. You acting as though that is an incredulous assertion to state that housing should not be a commodified market just tells me that you’re not really dedicated to ending homelessness.

You think I don’t want to solve homelessness? You must not either.

The solutions *are* simple. You’re handwringing about the implementation of those solutions, not the solutions themselves. You think it is difficult because fascists control the purse strings. If democrats want an easy win, then come up with a relatively simple policy and fight tooth and nail for it. They wont do either, because they have to appease capitalist donors who don’t want to solve homelessness and a base that wants to improve their own lives and the lives of their neighbors. This is an impossible fence to straddle, and its the reason why you think this is actually a complicated issue.

Whats complicated about it are the logistics and timelines necessary to ensure the followthrough of the policy. What is simple about it is crafting a policy which enables the state to enforce a solution."

A lot of the issues feel worse right now because frankly, it is worse. We are still recovering from the effects of the [ORGANIZATION] administration and [ORGANIZATION], which are highly disruptive events the city never prepared against. What [ORGANIZATION] needs right now is stability, and so far things are stabilizing. 

If you look at cities with some level of success in dealing with homeless people, providing permanent housing is a proven method. However to make this plan work you need consistency in good management and public support. Some businesses, in this case [ORGANIZATION], may suffer in the short term, but that's where public support needs to happen. From what I gathered [ORGANIZATION] has mostly a positive public images but if they backout now and start complaining that public image may get tarnished. After all their core customers are people who live in the poorer neighborhoods who understand and sympathize with the low income population. I also think that's what they see in [ORGANIZATION], the resilience of a small local business in a high crime neighborhood. [ORGANIZATION] represents hope for a better future, that business will stay and ride out the storms with its neighbors in testing times instead of abandoning them. 

However, if another round of events like [PERSON] or drastic political/ public policy changes happens to [ORGANIZATION], then I cannot say if things will ever get better. 

Here is a good read regarding [PERSON]'s success in dealing with the homeless population.

Conservatives like you have been whining about taxes for so long we can't afford stuff like cops and social services that work. If [PERSON] can't make a living here he's not alone. We need a community base before we have successful businesses and [ORGANIZATION] is what it looks like when you've been eroding your own community base on purpose since before the Berlin Wall came down.

With that being said, [ORGANIZATION] has an ID program which may help get you some form of identification. You will just have to wait until you get your other docs in. Ive seen people use the [INSTITUTION] in their area as an address to prove residence. Call Secretary of [ORGANIZATION] (yes, sit on that lame ass hold) and tell them you are homeless and need an ID. They can give you some options. Do you have ANY friends that can let you use their address?

Has [PERSON] been involved with this? I feel terrible for your younger siblings but you are in the absolute worst scenario and that's not fair for them. [PERSON] may be able to at least help your younger siblings without destroying your family unit.

- homelessness seems to be on the decline. The jobs market is insane. [ORGANIZATION] paying $18/hr. [PERSON] paying $33/hr. I attribute the lack of homelessness to the job market, amount of services available (to keep them off the streets), and the affordability of [ORGANIZATION] - 3rd most affordable state in the country). I just don't see many (or any) people sitting on the side of freeways offramps, [STREET] intersections, or downtown sidewalks. Even people with disabilities (physical and mental) are in high demand - which seems to explain the lack of homelessness. 

- drug use. [PERSON] usage is higher. You can smell people growing it (and not containing the smells). You can spot people ashing blunts/joints from their vehicles. You can smell vehicles (with really pungent weed) when they are smoking it. You can smell people smoking outside, especially [TIME]. IMO, I don't see many people suffering from (obvious) meth/heroin/coke. If we consider marijuana a drug; then yeah - [STREET] more drug usage there. Hard drug usage is probably down due to weed

- Crime does seem to be on a rise. Traffic infractions seem up - people just running red lights like they don't care, aggressive driving, etc. Shootings and aggravated assault crimes seem to be on the rise. Property theft seems to be on the rise. Burglaries and shopping theft also appears to be on the first. DATE0 always have more crime. IMO, [PERSON]'s obsession with guns and ease of access to guns is the source of this. My personal beliefs aside (I don't think citizens are responsible enough to possess the constitutional right to own an item whose sole purpose and utility is to murder), [STREET] too many people have a gun, [STREET] too many people don't secure their guns, [STREET] too many people have multiple guns, lackluster gun laws/restrictions, and the proliferation of ghost guns just continues to take its toll on the [PERSON]n population.

For people experiencing homelessness, having an address and stability combats substance use but also provides them an actual chance to become employed.  A job is the silver bullet for many of the issues present; gives them a sense of community and also stable income. I think in [ORGANIZATION] ( lived there for [ORGANIZATION] including [LOCATION]) the issue isn’t physical housing. It’s the individuals living on the streets aren’t able to rent the open properties. By allowing/assisting them to get housed then they can focus on other goals. In [PERSON] and most major cities they utilize a housing-first approach, understanding that people are less likely to get sober or employed if they do not have stable housing.

Forced mental health and substance addiction intervention would, but that's about it.

Thinking that the type homelessness you see in this camp is caused by a lack of affordable housing, or a lost job, or an unlucky streak isn't going to help. 

If a roof over their heads, and just some voluntary minor counseling was sufficient to move the needle on even 10% of the homeless, then it would be getting done as the first step, everywhere. Hell, you'd be an evil monster if you believed that is what it would take and didn't do it yourself.

If you truly desire to help the homeless addicts and junkies, petition your representatives to expand conservatorship.  I'm no fan of the state taking action, but the mentally ill and addicts are incapable of making informed decisions, and treating them as though they are is going to lead to more suffering, not less.


As an aside, I don't understand how the homeless are even alive at this point due to the pandemic.

The commission has set aside damn near $250k for continued support.

Their concerns for the FAC0 site have been to move them from the flood plain. The ampersee site will be next and is another concern but they are not ignoring the problem.

In all of my posts, have I ever once attacked a person?

And lastly, I'm not sure I stated any ""shitty"" opinions in my post. That homelessness is primarily caused by drug addiction and mental illness isn't an opinion so much as a fact. That ignoring the cause of a problem won't help solve it is an opinion, but you'd be hard pressed to explain to any rational human being that it's a shitty one.  That we should petition our representatives for enhanced conservatorship is an arguable opinion, you are free to disagree, even vehemently, bit that doesn't make it shitty.

And, I realize that your positions on issues are transactional and therefore can't be held when applied to more than two things at once, but that doesn't mean I'm the problem. More that your position(s) are.  Surely if the pandemic were as dangerous to people as the (over)reaction to it has implied, then the uninsured homeless, who last I checked weren't known for their peak of human health, would be littering the streets with their corpses.

Again, I get it. Your beliefs are transactional, and only meant to be held for one issue at a time. Your head must surely explode at the thought of a wam seeking an abortion being unable to get one because she won't wear a mask because she's been vaccinated and has severe issues of claustrophobia."

Feel free to hate me, I'm a big boy, I can take it.  But, you really shouldn't want others to suffer. I'm not sure why you want the homeless to suffer, or why you would be indifferent to the plight of your fellow humans, but you shouldn't have that position.  

Is it because they're poor? Do you only value people by their economic worth?  That is a disgusting position. Is it because they have mental health issues? Are you that intolerant of people who aren't neurotypical?  Or is because many of them have substance addiction?  It's NOT THEIR FAULT. Anyone with the addiction genes can become addicted, and the pharma companies got oh so many addicted. And, while these particular addicts may not all be a direct result of that, the resources that would have otherwise been used to help them got tied up in fixing the opioid crisis.

Actually, my largest concern is when you said:

> and anyone else that stands in the [STREET] of human progress.

Look, you're advocating for eugenics.  That is horrible. I'm not sure the type of ""progress"" you think society will achieve by killing the homeless, but I can assure you it is wrong, and would be very bad for society.

I strongly encourage you to go out and talk to homeless advocates to learn that the homeless are people too.  Maybe if you did that, you wouldn't be for their continued suffering and extermination.  Well, hopefully you would be for the extermination of the homeless in the sense that you would want to create a better society where they got the help they needed and no longer were homeless, as opposed to the kind of extermination you are advocating for where they all suffer and die needlessly."

It's absolutely amazing that the ORG1 operators manage to feed people, but apparently give no thought to protecting them from assault. Or... it is known that mental illness is over-represented among the homeless, and that some of these stories about assault are not quite credible.

.

For myself, I do agree with the ORG2, the homeless have no business camping out at FAC0. Its an eyesore and brings an unwanted element. I mean sure, fights, drugs, theft, and whatever already happen, but there are a lot of homeless who are mentally ill that it increases that element to happen. Also having done janitorial services for the old drop in and mission, I can tell you that many of the homeless don't give a fuck about cleanliness and others property. I have horror stories to share if you would like to know. Like the period blood I found smeared on the stall in the women's bathroom one time. Or puke filled sinks that were clogged with god knows what.

However I disagree with the ORG2's refusal to remedy the situation. You notice all the construction in the downtown area? They are always fixing something that doesn't need fixing. Like the sidewalks. Now they have the mall closed off because I guess the trees need to be trimmed or something like that. They could instead pour the money into improving the [ORGANIZATION] and [LOCATION] shelters or even building a new shelter all together. But they don't. They claim they don't have the funds, which is bullshit. If you got the funds to redo a sidewalk six times a year, you got the funds to renovate or build the homeless shelters.

&#x200B;

And threatening them with arrest isn't an ideal move either. There are plenty of homeless who will commit a petty crime, to just stay [ORGANIZATION] in jail, the end result is, they have a [STREET] to sleep and food to eat. Threatening them with arrest will do nothing but cause the already overcrowded jail to become even more overcrowded.

[ORGANIZATION] sold to a developer instead.,"They'll just build more overpriced condos instead, of course that's what we need. Making the affordable housing crisis worse rather than helping."
19,2018-06-20 21:54:49 UTC,13,2018-06-21 16:20:52 UTC,Why is [ORGANIZATION] overrun with homelessness?,"It's a complex issue that isn't particularly represented well by what you see on the streets. [ORGANIZATION] does have serious issues with poverty, housing, and homelessness, but even if we substantially addressed those, you'd likely still see people begging on the streets. Some 90+% of the chronically homeless (key word chronically) in [ORGANIZATION] have a mental or physical disability. The solution for those folks is a more comprehensive wrap around service connected to mental health, housing, and other services, as they need rather in-depth help. Solving our housing issues alone won't help those folks, as they'll still be left out due to their limitations. Having a better economy alone won't help those folks, as they'll be left out due to their limitations. Many have already stated here that the mental health hospital is located here and they often just let folks out. The homelessness you see on the streets is far more connected to our nation's lack of compassion and solutions for mental health issues. 

Some of the people you see begging aren't actually homeless. Many of the folks I've encountered in my neighborhood live in adult foster care homes. They have a home and food, but they want money for smokes and whatnot, so they ask for money. I have no clue what the percentage of non-homeless people asking for money is, but I imagine it's relevant. 

Sadly, we also are a destination point for a small number of folks. Again, I have no clue what percentage of what you see on the streets is represented by these folks. When I was moving here from [PERSON], my neighbor's brother (who either lived with his sister or went out for [ORGANIZATION] living in his vehicle) said he knew [ORGANIZATION] because it was one of the good cities to travel to when homeless. He said he'd spent [PERSON] here. He had no roots here, and I imagine many others don't as well. It's just a good city to be in. Not much really solves this issue. I was also at a conference on [ORGANIZATION] once and when I mentioned I was from [ORGANIZATION], some folks from [ORGANIZATION] said they knew of us because when they have a client with mental health issues and they've exhausted all of their resources locally, they buy them a one [STREET] ticket on the [ORGANIZATION] to [ORGANIZATION]."

The police aren't allowed to boot panhandlers or people sleeping in the parks. The missions take anyone and everyone as long as they don't use drugs at the location or start fights. The [ORGANIZATION]/bus stop is a cheap ride in for [ORGANIZATION] and a cheap ride out in [LOCATION]. You can walk to either hospital and get free healthcare because laws dictate they can't be turned away. Homeless come here because it's a great [STREET] to be homeless.

- lower taxes for you, me, and corporations. And especially rich people...

- only give government dollars to businesses, in the form of grants, more tax breaks, or funding initiatives in different departments of government...who then buy stuff from businesses (construction services, technology, etc)

Housing affordability can be a problem. Especially housing affordable for young and lower income (for [ORGANIZATION] - this is housing at 150-200k (or less)).

The theory is; jobs are created (or sustained) building homes. Therefore government money is used to stimulate local economy. Homebuyers have more housing inventory to pick from. Home sellers incentivized to sell will lower their asking price, due to new housing inventory. 

What is funny is; democrat or republican - they both want to spend money like crazy. They just want to use it on different programs and different beneficiaries.

Sure - in theory this will work. We build a buttload of homes. And maybe prices moderate, even decreasing in value. It will take [ORGANIZATION] to accomplish. And unless there is more to the program; it ain't going to solve homelessness - just try to make housing more affordable.


I think the question everyone is also wondering is; who wants homeless people moving in next door to them? Serious question. If you owned a home, and a couple homes get built for homeless people...who wants that in their neighborhood? And how will the people maintain the homes? How will they pay property taxes? How will they obtain health care or mental health services? It's a solution to a problem - but not the homeless problem."

Another point the [ORGANIZATION] city taxes even after the break are still higher than the surrounding area. I just bought a home in [PERSON] because the taxes were lower for a far nicer house than in GPE2. 

I implore anyone that thinks they can offer low income housing to the homeless for significantly less than the market rates to buy, maintain, manage and lease homes out for the reduced rate. It’s easy to sit behind a keyboard and shame landlords for not having lower rates. The majority of [ORGANIZATION] landlords are working class people that will be in that camp as well if they have to lower prices! "

So, until people are ready to make change and the non homeless people demand change, we can't do anything. 

&#x200B;

As for the man peeing as people drove by, yeah people saw it and probably kids, but it's a penis, and all people pee. Assuming that he was deviant in his actions is one of the reasons why people fear everyone. Why can't we just think he was peeing? I mean it's not that big of a deal. "
14,2019-03-27 00:55:29 UTC,9,2019-03-27 13:22:17 UTC,Homeless camp on FAC0 and FAC1.,The homeless population in [ORGANIZATION] is growing because we have so many resources available that draw people from as far away as [PERSON] county and so people who live a marginal existence come here for those services. As for the flashing man many of these people have mental and substance abuse issues and this is just a side effect of providing so many services. 
14,2019-03-27 00:55:29 UTC,3,2019-03-27 19:31:44 UTC,Homeless camp on FAC0 and FAC1.,"The source or cause of the homeless population isn't really known. I read however that one contributing factor could be the mental hospital. When people are old enough, they check themselves out of the hospital when they are still unwell. That combined with low income areas, availability of addictive drugs, and resources which draw people from afar are probably all contributors."
14,2019-03-27 00:55:29 UTC,7,2019-03-27 14:02:26 UTC,Homeless camp on FAC0 and FAC1.,"A lot of the services available require proof of residence in [ORGANIZATION]. Mental illness is severely under serviced, especially for the homeless population because many do not have insurance because they do not have the needed documents in order to get it. To get help, real help, you need insurance because otherwise the medication is unaffordable and the treatment services aren't available unless they can't be paid for. As for affordable housing, again the services available for that require proof and documentation. The wait list for subsidized housing is ungodly long due to the fact that there is a lack of affordable housing. Many landlords do not want to provide that subsidized housing because of the stereotype of who uses that service. The landlords want the profit, and in order to be a subsidized housing landlord means taking less profit, and why would they do that when they can gauge college students? They know they're going to pay it or their parents are going to pay it and the landlord can make a surplus in profit. 

A lot of people assume that just any one can access services in [ORGANIZATION], but a lot of the services require you to be part of a certain zip code and require you to bring proof of that residence. Even churches do that. Diaper banks, food banks, etc. 98% require proof of that residence. 

This homeless camp is just a small percentage of a larger problem that doesn't jus effect [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] has the largest population of homeless children in the state...So many of my students are living at the shelter downtown. This is a problem everywhere. It's a hard thing to really solve, and unfortunately you can't solve it, just because there are people who don't want help or don't qualify. 

Instead of judging those who are homeless and peeing in public, maybe [ORGANIZATION] could have asked herself WHY this person was doing what they were doing and how could she be a part of a solution. What person can we call to advocate for more affordable housing that isn't in slums? How can I make this situation a teaching moment to my child or to a child I know so that they understand the inequalities and the inadequacies in our society.

It is almost certainly citable precedent if a similar case were to be brought against [PERSON].

Here's the actual ruling.. The nut quotes:

> We [...] so hold that an ordinance violates the Eighth Amendment insofar as it imposes criminal sanctions against homeless individuals for sleeping outdoors, on public property, when no alternative shelter is available to them.

> We conclude that a municipality cannot criminalize such behavior consistently with the Eighth Amendment when no sleeping space is practically available in any shelter.

Seems open and shut: once shelters are full, ""a municipality"" (notably not ""the City,"" meaning [ORGANIZATION]) cannot enforce such an ordinance. Expect a Constitutional challenge to [PERSON]'s ordinance citing this decision, which will likely prevail. [ORGANIZATION] could attempt an appeal, but I can't see [ORGANIZATION] taking this up, and they're next. (They might; it is a Constitutional point.)

I see no possible outcomes aside from [PERSON] following [ORGANIZATION]'s lead and suspending enforcement when shelters are full (or suspending outright), withdrawing the ordinance completely, waiting for someone convicted to sue and prevailing over it anyway, or selling the parks to a private organization and sidestepping ""public property"" entirely.

No opinion offered on my part, merely interpretation of the ruling and its impact."

Indeed, which is why you'll likely see the call not even be made, and a defang of the entire ordinance is likely. If they care about the homeless, the shelter would be incentivized to unconditionally report that it's full to the city (so the folks it cannot take are not prosecuted), which would then have to spend resources to confirm that. If I were reviewing this for [ORGANIZATION], I'd take the easy [STREET] out and just strike the ordinance entirely."

I don't know if that's true, but it is something I've heard from more than one person which stands in contrast to what you've heard.

What you've put forth is not the legal argument in question, that they had no other options. Nobody even has to make that argument. The legal argument in question is that if all practical shelters are full, *and* someone is prosecuted under an ordinance for choosing to sleep on public property (irrespective of not choosing ""other options,"" which are not discussed in this ruling and not immediately apparent to me), their prosecution is flatly unconstitutional. The Eighth Amendment is interpreted rather broadly and there's a chance this ruling could be reversed in time, whether by review or appeal, but as it stands right now, by federal ruling, [ORGANIZATION] is forced to reckon with a potentially unconstitutional ordinance in certain circumstances on the books."

Part of the issue is that a ton of these people are REFUSING aid. They cherry pick the social programs that enable them to live like this. I am sure there is no small amount of pride too.

Don't get me wrong, I am all for helping those that can be helped. Getting the working poor and (especially) children affordable housing, helping those willing to work to find jobs and lift themselves out of their situation, providing drug counseling to those who desire to overcome their addictions, and giving care and mental health services to those that cannot care for themselves.

But the truth is, many of the homeless cannot be helped. They won't follow society's rules, they don't want to work, they don't want end their addictions. They cannot be helped.

Many people think it is the government's role to provide for these people. It is not. That is not what the government was set up to do, and it is not something that the government does particularly well.

You can't go to many shelters without being forced to go to some kind of church service.  

Also, let's not forget a lot of them do have drug and alcohol problems. Shelters won't take those people.  You have to be sober to get in to a shelter.  That's not as easy to do as you'd like to think.  Most homeless people choose not to use their shelters because there are too many rules.  "

* There are school-aged children facing homelessness in *every school district* in [ORGANIZATION]. Requiring a family to move out of their school district to get housing assistance further disrupts their education. This is about providing stability for children so they can get the most out of their education.

* Centralized housing also would imply temporary housing. This means moving in (and possibly switching school districts) and then, when the family may be able to support themselves again, it would mean moving out and possibly switching school districts yet again.

* Lastly, I think a centralized housing development for people experiencing homelessness could quickly become discriminated against in employment. An employer may choose to pass up a qualified candidate based on their address--knowing they live in temporary housing for the homeless.

Your absolutely right, sadly, we treat those with the least resources the poorest often. I notice many in the [ORGANIZATION] community tend to make generalizations about homeless people from the few encounters they have had, or stories they have heard. No one ever tells stories about the homeless who blend into our city.

I think it is also important to keep in mind that poverty and homelessness affect people with mental illness disproportionately. If you have a bad interaction with someone who is homeless I think it is important to keep this in mind--we all struggle with our own demons, and when you do not have a [STREET] to call home that struggle is intensified.

[ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] — An innovative project in the works since [ORGANIZATION] to house homeless individuals in housing pods [LOCATION] will not come to reality.

DATE1 after [ORGANIZATION] spent $1 million on 50 [ORGANIZATION] housing units — designed to house 66 people — the organization announced DATE2, it is canceling the project and will sell the pods to another community.

The POD community, or “[STREET] of Dignity,” was to be a 24/7, fully-staffed community providing transitional housing for members of [LOCATION]’s unhoused population.

[ORGANIZATION] spent [ORGANIZATION] trying to identify a site to [STREET] the pods. In [DATE], the organization announced it had [identified a location]([URL] at [DATE] FAC0, just west of FAC1, and was hopeful to open [PERSON].

Prior to settling on the FAC2 site, the planned location had changed multiple times since the project was first announced in [ORGANIZATION]. The FAC2 site, like others, had its challenges, including those in the community who [spoke out against it]([URL]

“By bringing the PODs to [LOCATION], we took a bold, creative step to tackle a serious need in a compassionate [STREET],” [ORGANIZATION] Director [PERSON] said in a statement. “It was something new and different. At times, that was hard for some folks to grasp.

“But in the end, our innovative approach sparked new momentum for addressing homelessness.”

That momentum, [PERSON] said, has resulted in local municipalities working together to explore new ways to address homelessness in the [LOCATION] area.

[LOCATION] County and the city of [LOCATION] recently revealed a shared effort to establish a shelter for individuals and families who are unhoused. While details remain in development, the city has [committed $1.2 million]([URL] while the county is exploring possible locations.

“It’s heartening to see our communities coming together to make sure every person has a safe [STREET] to stay while seeking long-term housing,” [PERSON] said.

[PERSON] said this local collaboration reflects the message [ORGANIZATION] has championed: Every person deserves a [STREET] of dignity where they can rebuild their lives.

[PERSON] expressed gratitude for donors and organizations that supported the project, particularly ORG2, which stored the pods for free and offered property to host the proposed site on FAC2.

“The energy and support we experienced for this project showed that there are people in our community who care and who want to help those facing homelessness,” she said.

While [ORGANIZATION] will not go forward, [PERSON] said the plan also helped [STREET] the [ORGANIZATION] extension of the city’s emergency housing ordinance in [LOCATION]. It also prompted awareness and discussion of the need for sustainable housing, she said.

“The key now is to keep that momentum going,” [PERSON] said. “[ORGANIZATION] is eager to bring its expertise to the collaboration and to do our part to support a safe, secure and supportive strategy that will change people’s lives with dignity and compassion.”"

Why do you think someone should give an employer their labor if that employer is not willing to ensure their employee’s needs are met?

I’d argue if an employee’s needs are met, they’re able to be maximally productive in their role. If an employer isn’t willing to meet a potential employee’s needs, that worker might decide that busking/begging is a better step to meeting their needs while they employ homeless services.

Also, capitalism as a system requires this economic underclass. The argument exists that without the threat of homelessness, people would not look for work, or work to ensure employment. Per that argument, homeless folks *must* exist to be an example.

Many people remain homeless because of untreated mental illness which they struggle to address because the majority of mental health care is paywalled. The easiest [STREET] through that paywall is with health insurance, which is most easily obtained through full time employment. That full time employment usually comes with a [ORGANIZATION] probationary period to ensure that a worker doesn’t just come get what they need and leave, which is more than enough time for an employee to lose their job over an issue caused or exacerbated by their mental illness.

16,2015-09-11 01:29:08 UTC,1,2015-09-13 00:22:20 UTC,Campaign for tax to assist homeless [ORGANIZATION] families kicks off,"Currently, $125,000 from the county's general fund is put towards housing assistance. This millage would replace that with ~$800,000/yr worth of tax assistance to approximately 1,500 qualifying families--about $530 per family.

This is really about equal access to quality education for all children. Children who's families face homeless and food insecurity are much more unlikely to be prepared and successful at school. Homelessness, safety, and access to food have a huge impact on a child's ability to learn.

All children have a right to equal access education, regardless of their family's circumstances. To make education equal for all children we must recognize that different children cost different amounts to have equal access to education. The real victims in a family facing homelessness are children. Childhood development is so critically important to health and wealth later in life and you are only a child once."

The new bike lanes have given the homeless more places to hang out and panhandle. (Edit: For those who lack reading comprehension, I mean it GIVES THEM MORE [ORGANIZATION], not that we created bike lanes for them to hang out.)

I've definitely noticed an increase while driving downtown, and I've lived here for [LOCATION]. I've seen triple the numbers along and near intersections. There are a few shelters along FAC0, so they tend to congregate and panhandle on the nearby streets.

- Creates traffic congestion

- Increases pollution

- Kills businesses Part 1 (low population density = not enough customers to shop)

- Kills businesses Part 2 (thousands of miles of roads across low population density means higher property taxes are needed to maintain them)

- Kills businesses Part 3 (pulls people away from [ORGANIZATION] - and toward areas like [ORGANIZATION])

- Creates a car dependent environment

- Creates urban heating (all these cars need a [STREET] to park, parking lots absorb heat. This creates heat islands)

- Financially hurts residents (all these thousands of miles of roads and utility services need to be maintained - thru higher taxes)

- Increases commute times

- Increases traffic deaths (more people speeding around your subdivision, just so they can cut that [ADDRESS] across town town to [TIME] - all to get a ice cream cone)

- Allows blight and poverty to spread, unchecked, in neighborhoods that people consider abandoned or no-go zones

- Destroys property values (the hot neighborhood of [ORGANIZATION] is just more suburban sprawl with aging homes, with no reason to live in the middle of what used to be a corn field)

- Increases crime (more area to patrol means police are more spread out, and not able to maintain a presence or respond as quick)


Other issues that I feel are important include;

- Lack of job growth/creation

- Inability to attract new employers

- Lack of focus on downtown development (no concert venues, no arenas, no reason to go downtown)

- Declining student population - which creates a myriad of problems

I don’t think homelessness is a problem for [PERSON], per se. The whole country has a homeless problem. [PERSON] isn’t unique here. [PERSON] doesn’t seem much worse off than other places. If we took residents of GPE2 or [PERSON] and asked them if [PERSON] had a homeless problem; they would say there isn’t a homeless problem. I don’t even see that many people begging on the side of the roads anymore. But when [ORGANIZATION] is paying $18/hr, ORG1 $33/hr….I guess it makes sense that people don’t have to beg for money anymore."

States and cities all over [PERSON] send their homeless to [ORGANIZATION] because we simply won't turn them away without getting some sort of services. Having worked and volunteering at the shelters that are in town I've seen people from all walks of life and from all over the country retreat to [ORGANIZATION], specifically [ORGANIZATION], and [ORGANIZATION], who profits from the homeless. 

It's a revolving door, in my time at [ORGANIZATION] and even FAC0 when it was open women and families would bounce between these places as well as the ORG2 for homeless services. And a lot of times you'd see the same clients at about the same time DATE0 or [PERSON] at these shelters.  It isn't as easy as breaking the cycle and the issue isn't as concrete as we think it is, and now with the [ORGANIZATION] promise having been here for [PERSON] we are seeing a housing crisis cause families that once were offered housing can't get into it because of various barriers, most existing because we don't have enough housing for what is honestly needed, and with the sellers market a lot of former rentals we're put up for sale for record profits and a lot of landlords have pulled out of the renting game for various reasons.

We as a city can't seem to keep up with affordable housing options.  Yes there are new housing complexes all over the county, but most aren't affordable, and most that need affordable housing don't have the means or the credit to apply for said housing. And more and more people just keep coming."

First off, due to [ORGANIZATION] having services for the homeless provided by different charities it increases the number of homeless coming to the area. Second, low income housing isn’t something that just magically appears. It take a lot of time to build and develop infrastructure that can manage low income housing. Third Costs are rising in the city, this is simple economics. Property values rise as demand for said property goes up. It’s up to private business owners to set the costs of rent not the city. [ORGANIZATION] has done significantly more than most places to create more affordable homes for low income. The creamery for instance is a development specifically for low income households that was a property provided by the city.

What there is no shortage of is individuals blaming the city for not doing enough while they literally do nothing aside from point fingers at others. It’s a complex problem but [ORGANIZATION] didn’t cause it they’re merely stuck with it and a litany of other issues. Blaming landlords and the city for not giving out endless handouts isn’t a solution.

Is this feeling based on actual evidence that this is the reality we are facing in [ORGANIZATION], or based on something else? I don't ask this as a defense of [ORGANIZATION], but merely as a question to ponder. I certainly have a bit of an echo chamber on my social media, and if relied too heavily on that info, I'd probably feel similar to you.

76,2022-01-08 19:55:29 UTC,11,2022-01-09 14:49:47 UTC,My issue with [ORGANIZATION],"As a homeowner, I would expect the police to remove it. The needles, trash, violence, guns....these issues are more prevalent in homeless camps. I know everyone in a homeless camp doesn't use drugs intravenously, or throw trash everywhere, or own a gun, but....a not insignificant amount of them do. It's not that I don't recognize the issue, it's just that we can't turn 1 issue in to 2 issues, which is what allowing homeless camps near residential areas creates. 

Since these poor folks have very little to live for.....they are quick to make life or death choices. Like.... kidnapping your child, like sharing needles, like leaving dirty needles on the ground, like shooting your dog. Or because they are mentally unfit, raping your dog....

I can't say that [ORGANIZATION] is focusing more on homeless than violence, but it seems fair to say the two issues are linked. 

Are there any homeless success stories that we can hear for a change? Like sharing words of inspiration, about how they straighten up, got a job, got a house?"

If we could come together to help house people it wouldn't make [ORGANIZATION] into a crimeless utopia, but it'd be a step in the right direction.

Criminal activity within the homeless community (I.e. theft between individuals) is common yes but gun violence is not.

In actuality, the homeless rally around each other and really are trying to just survive, especially right now."

76,2022-01-08 19:55:29 UTC,6,2022-01-09 15:18:54 UTC,My issue with [ORGANIZATION],"This problem isn’t unique to [ORGANIZATION]. Cities across the country have elevated levels of homelessness. Mountain-west cities appear to have far greater homeless populations. [PERSON] reportedly has a bigger homeless problem now than ever before.

This isn’t a failure of [ORGANIZATION], but a failure of cities in general.  A popular [ORGANIZATION] named [ORGANIZATION] collaborated with [ORGANIZATION] to do a story about liberal hypocrisy fueling American inequality. [ORGANIZATION] is a good guy; you can tell he has a progressive opinion, but he is rooted in fact. He doesn’t armchair quarterback, he literally flies across the world to get up close and personal with issues. I encourage you to watch this video, and share it with friends. It was an eye opener for me. I never thought liberals might actually [ORGANIZATION] of the problem.

[URL]

The TL:DR of the video is; in areas where democrats and liberals have a complete grip on power (think [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], etc); why do the cities still suck? Why are the issues bigger than ever, still? If democrats have all the answers; where is the proof that their answers work? 

IMO, this isn’t a [ORGANIZATION] problem, this is a problem with cities, in general. I don’t know if it is entirely fair to just democrats, but in areas where democrats have complete control over everything; democrats don’t seem to be doing any better. 

What are your thoughts? What are your thoughts on the video? Why do you think democrat run areas don’t demonstrate better solutions?"
76,2022-01-08 19:55:29 UTC,37,2022-01-08 21:05:49 UTC,My issue with [ORGANIZATION],"Really? Because I've lived in [DATE] of 3 locations and had issues with homeless stealing or attempting to enter our residence.

Again I'm all for finding better solutions for them, but don't pretend a class of people who are desperate won't resort to theft and violence."

76,2022-01-08 19:55:29 UTC,12,2022-01-08 22:51:02 UTC,My issue with [ORGANIZATION],"If you have so much anecdotal evidence from homeless people, ask them how bad tent city was, there was theft, assaults, rapes, stabbing, shooting insanely frequently.

76,2022-01-08 19:55:29 UTC,5,2022-01-09 14:54:52 UTC,My issue with [ORGANIZATION],"This is where your argument falls apart. 

The connection to homelessness and crime is significant. These people defecate on your lawns, leave trash in your playground, needles on the sidewalks, steal your garbage bins, kidnap your children, shoot your dog. All of these are real issues that have really been caused by homeless people. 

We recognize the homeless have increased rates of mental illness, and oftentimes they have a nothing to live for mentality. These are folks you don't want to have ""snapping"" around you. Because when they do....things get really bad, really quick"
76,2022-01-08 19:55:29 UTC,10,2022-01-08 21:26:21 UTC,My issue with [ORGANIZATION],"You’re very correct. I fear the delays will only persist further, as will the oppressive nature of the [INSTITUTION].

Unfortunately, there seems to be a disgustingly decent amount of fascist-simps who see no problem with wiping out a displaced minority, simply on the grounds of that minority not “benefiting society”. 

Whenever someone on this subreddit addresses or attempts to address the unhoused injustices brought out by [ORGANIZATION] (or even the recent ORG1 show debacle) the mods will lock posts, ban those OPs or simply be complacent with harassment of those users by other fascist-simp users. 

In regards with the abomination that is our “public safety” department, it’s truly abysmal how quickly some will trade in their humanity to defend such cruel acts."

On the other hand, they might snoop around to see if a homeless individual is taking refuge, trying to survive, just in the case. The whole reason that the sweeps occurred wasn’t solely due to tents. Simply making it illegal to camp out on public land in the city limits was another big addition to the crisis as well. The whole situation is messy"

76,2022-01-08 19:55:29 UTC,4,2022-01-08 23:19:01 UTC,My issue with [ORGANIZATION],"I will admit that the tent cities were not well done. I wasn’t as involved with the community then as I am now. But now, the rules then city have put is that they cannot have anymore than six people gathered in a space. So many try to adhere to it because they don’t want to bring attention to themselves. What this is really about is that destroying shelters is wrong and the gospel mission isn’t the end all be all for [TIME] shelters. There are so many factors. 

So what I do learn from talking to the homeless is about how cold they are, how someone has stolen their stuff and now have to start over again. How they have their housing vouchers but no one will let them rent or there isn’t anywhere available to rent that’s affordable. How they just want to stay warm and keep their stuff. How theyre banned from the shelter for one reason or another. 

I won’t say that all are created equal but many are so much better than people think."

But its not just black and white, residents shouldn't have to put up with increased crime, violence and drug usage near their houses. Homeless camps shouldn't be something children should ever have to come close to. And home owners shouldn't have to worry about fortifying their houses and being paranoid about their belongings 24/7.


It's a complex matter with no silver bullet solution."

The state of [ORGANIZATION] offers free state ID cards to homeless people. The postal service has a policy in [STREET] to set up a PO Box for a homeless person. There are systems in [STREET] to get people going. It has to be up to them to take advantage though."
76,2022-01-08 19:55:29 UTC,-6,2022-01-08 22:28:42 UTC,My issue with [ORGANIZATION],"From this, it would seem you feel the homeless are more of a fortified threat to the public than a militarized police force wrongfully evicting people and allowing those people to freeze to death. There are videos of the police destroying the homeless encampments and what little of their property they have, if you have time to research this hot-button topic."
76,2022-01-08 19:55:29 UTC,1,2022-01-09 00:17:46 UTC,My issue with [ORGANIZATION],"Yep. So the ID you’re talking about, is for the county and outside of the county it’s useless but for jobs here it’s useful. But, unfortunately that ID isn’t good enough to get a reissued birth certificate or SS card. I’m helping an unhoused individual with this process right now and these are the barriers he is facing with it. So he is working with [ORGANIZATION] to try and get his birth certificate but it’s a process. It’s really that the state and federal programs aren’t working together to make it easy for individuals to get all of this done. Also to get a state ID you can’t have a PO Box as an address on it. So it’s just a lot of conflicting things that make it hard…not impossible just incredibly time consuming and many of these individuals need help navigating because they don’t understand what they’re reading or what people are saying or they don’t have the education to navigate the systems needed. It’s a crap show"
76,2022-01-08 19:55:29 UTC,3,2022-01-09 01:27:39 UTC,My issue with [ORGANIZATION],"I agree with you and there are a lot of variables. I’ve seen determination win and they get jobs and I’ve seen addictions take hold and they are reduced to zombies. It’s so much deeper though than just “they can get jobs if they wanted” because there is a lot happening underneath that doesn’t get talked about. Like one thing that one of the peeps I see regularly was super proud to tell me that he got his [ORGANIZATION] sober chip and got a debit card (his daughter set up an account for him). But it was a huge moment and deserves to be celebrated. So he’s overcoming addiction and now starting the process of trying to find a job, even with a job he will likely be homeless still for quite a time because the lack of affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]. Which that in turn makes it hard for people to stay straight when they’re doing all the right things then can get the one thing they’re doing it for…a roof over their heads. Then the cycle repeats."

It discredits the argument made by someone like the OP, because it makes them appear as uninformed, and even comes off as offensive to some. Offensive because the OP appears to expect residential areas to accept all the issues that come from homelessness as insignificant, and that residential areas should welcome them as new neighbors."

The fact that you have stated the amount you donate, as opposed to ""a box of [PERSON] and cheese"" suggests that those who do not have the capability to donate as much as you do are not helping as ""much"" or ""as good"" as you are when they donate their time, acts of service, or other items.

Wow, that's a really antagonizing tone that will surely win over people to help. Also, as someone who has worked in a public business with regular customers, the reason it's ""customers only"" is countless homeless people stole toiletries from the bathrooms, pissed everywhere, shot up drugs, and a lot of the time fell asleep for [TIME] and had to be woken up and asked to leave.

The fact is that homeless people overwhelmingly need assistance that just takes a lot of money and infrastructure.

It's clear that based on the comments here people don't want to give that help or don't have the patience to give that help.

Given that it was previously illegal, and it still happened, do you really think this will make a practical difference? Are there homeless people who previously didn't defecate in public who are suddenly going to because of this change?  


If someone wanted more enforcement (which I'm hearing many people do downtown) then this change is in your favor, as previously no one faced any consequences of any kind. Yes, it was a misdemeanor, which in practice, means it's not enforced. How many cases of public defecation did our courts previously actually hear? I suspect none.   


If we already know the status quo didn't work, and we acknowledge that there probably aren't any homeless people who are going to suddenly decide to go outside when they didn't before, I don't see what the potential harm is. It was already more illegal, and that wasn't working. More illegal doesn't always mean better enforcement. ""Right sized"" legal structures allow for more effective enforcement. Now, will there be more effective enforcement? Who knows.

It's a great, friendly neighborhood, especially if you put yourself out there and meet your neighbors. The community seems tighter in the ""Triangle"" where you're looking (I'm on the other side of FAC0) and you'll be around good people. The most common ""crime"" you'll encounter is speeding on FAC1 and FAC2. As with anywhere else, occasional package theft and car rummagings happen. Lock your doors - park in the garage. You'll be near an awesome sledding hill and will have quick access to a few great parks. 

Yup, downtown has some homeless folks, just like anywhere else with humans. Downtown as a whole is at a turning point, and IMO it's for the better! The old guards and staples are phasing out (pissing off many), but some great new restaurants and bars have come in, and we'll only see more as the city makes changes that cater more to the young professional demographic that is moving in. The folks you'll see crying about downtown either can't handle change or aren't used to life outside their car.

Unfortunately, there’s 4-5 abandoned homeless encampments, with another 3-4 active encampments spread throughout the woods.  

There is trash everywhere.  I’ve been walking the park for [ORGANIZATION] and [LOCATION] the trash has gotten to be quite bad.  There’s also grocery carts littered throughout and along the train tracks.  

I understand that people have to have a [STREET] to live, but if the city of [ORGANIZATION] decides to leave the encampments alone, then they should take up some kind of responsibility to maintain the park so that everyone else can continue to enjoy it."

65,2021-03-17 00:58:01 UTC,10,2021-03-17 14:32:14 UTC,Trashed Park,"Agreed. There seems to be tons of controversy surrounding the homeless problem in [ORGANIZATION].

 I know this is an unpopular opinion but I have mixed feelings towards the issue. I'm unsure what else the city can do to actually support this population. But I feel some people believe that our city has this unlimited  amount of funds and resources which are being withheld from helping them.... 

but for some reason my compassion towards adults who trash the area is dwindling.. especially when I come across dirty syringes left near playgrounds. I actually  discovered a syringe 💉  on the ground next to the jungle gym at FAC0 recently. This is a [STREET] where I see small toddlers running around all the time. I was horrified to imagine an unsuspecting [ORGANIZATION] just picking it up out of curiosity. At the time I wasn't sure the best [STREET] to deal with it but did my due diligence and called the non-emergency police line.

I say homeless because he didn’t have any shoes on and his clothes looked pretty torn up.  I assume that he came from one of the encampments close by.

I do know that homeless people choosing not to abide by shelter rules and preferring to  sleep on the [STREET] can be a big reason why you see homeless people on the [STREET], but right now here in [ORGANIZATION], from my understanding, the shelters have just plain run out of capacity, which is why the encampments have sprung up."
65,2021-03-17 00:58:01 UTC,4,2021-03-17 14:56:07 UTC,Trashed Park,Exactly OP that’s what people don’t understand. Perhaps the solution is one designated shelter/area where they can be antisocial and do their own thing with no rules; [LOCATION] like skid row in [ORGANIZATION] because SOME of the homeless population doesn’t want to be helped with a nicer shelter with some sense of order since they don’t want to/can’t (due to mental illness) abide by the rules of the shelter/mission or the rules of a normal society in general. I have worked at shelters and you try and help some people even going  out of your [STREET] to do so and they are rude/ disrespectful to the people trying to help them. A prime example of this would  be the post above where they leave their trash everywhere at a park that the city turned a blind eye at and allowed them to stay....It really is a complicated issue and I know every person in this  situation is different but in the case of falling on hard times or job loss it’s not like nobody tried to help them at one point and they didn’t burn all their bridges...

50,2021-08-22 20:08:51 UTC,4,2021-08-24 12:34:12 UTC,What’s the scariest thing you have seen in [ORGANIZATION]?,"The homeless encampments down by the river. The scene looks like something out of [ORGANIZATION] or [PERSON]. It was mind boggling to see the amount of trash created; dumpsters not even a 100 feet away, and trash as far as the eye can see. The encampment had at least two fire outbreaks. There was at least one stabbing, multiple assaults. Then the rains in [ORGANIZATION] caked the entire area in mud. It looks like a shanty town or [ORGANIZATION] in a third world nation. Something about it sticks out to me. The combination of trash, violence, fires, mud - it easily would be the scariest thing I can witness in [PERSON]. It would also be (IMO) the least safe [STREET] in [PERSON]. 

This is in contrast with [PERSON] (who I will use as a positive example). They live on sidewalks or on lots. They use one side of the sidewalk with the building as a wall in their home. They put the tents next to each other, making it orderly and easier for health care visitors to support them. The have parking lots specifically for the homeless who live out of their vehicles. Due to housing costs in [PERSON], many people still work normal jobs and can afford a vehicle, but not a house. The lots are secured at [TIME], have cooling centers, makeshift kitchens, running water, dumpsters for waste, and electricity. They have volunteers who help out, and enforce the rules. It is sad to say; [PERSON] homeless people would be kicked out of these homeless camps :( (improper waste disposal, creating public health hazard). 

I never seen PERSON0 or the [ORGANIZATION] murders, but if I were a witness to it; it would probably be up there.

I will second the roads; a lot of roads have no shoulders, very few bike paths (especially on the outskirts around town), no ring-roads to pull commuters away from city streets, 45mph+ speed limits (And many people speed up to 15-20mph over. So do the math), many of the roads are darker (no [STREET] lights, trees overhanging the [STREET]), and many of the roads are practically designed to allow a [ADDRESS] with a speed greater than 35mph."

This was back in [ORGANIZATION] or [LOCATION]. We lived a couple houses back on FAC0. I heard it as I was cutting through to my house behind FAC2 right there on FAC1. My roommate and I sat and listened through the window and watched across our neighbors yard; looking at the fence the shouting was coming from behind. We thought some homeless ( possibly crack addicted ) people were having some kind of domestic dispute, and the males voice was all deep and demonic sounding, to the point it gave us chills and a disturbing “off” kinda feeling. We called the police. As soon as they showed up and approached the little area between the store and the fence behind it, the screaming ended immediately. When they came out 5 min later they escorted a tiny little black lady no more than 90 lbs soaking wet. She had to be doing all that screaming by herself. And the voices overlapped each other so we expected 2 people to
Be escorted out. Nope. They walked her to the car and gently helped her into the back. I’m guessing she went to the psych ward. It still haunts me. We were already creeped out living there because they found a decapitated head and some hands in the woods between [ORGANIZATION] and some apartments over there. It was a murder robbery."

It’s not like people are eagerly lining up to be homeless or want to be forced to have biological movements in public spaces. A fine is stupid, criminalizing it is stupid, doing nothing to go upstream and ensure people have access to facilities is also stupid. Thinking this is an issue that deserves national attention, and a commissioner to be harassed, is just pure ignorance."

[ORGANIZATION], politicians and anyone in authority has to be able to make tough choices, and also live with the consequences. 

This was a tough choice for [ORGANIZATION]. In no [STREET] do I condone or support politicians being harassed, stalked, receiving threats of violence, or anything along those lines. But there needs to be a healthy debate, and people have to remember some of their choices will evoke a lot of emotions. 

If anything, the city of [ORGANIZATION] should be using the attention and momentum they have on this issue to actually do something more to solve the issue, instead of waving the white flag. Everyone is talking about it. Even the business owners and people critical of the decriminalization of public defecation are in support of more bathrooms downtown. Not only for homeless people, but for festivals at FAC0, etc. Strike while the iron is hot. Pivot, and use public pressure on those who get in the [STREET] of more bathrooms being installed downtown. 

The point is, [ORGANIZATION] and everyone in [ORGANIZATION] is in the hot seat. They chose to do this. They know the risks. [ORGANIZATION] should, [ORGANIZATION], go on ORG1 ""news"" and defend this on PERSON1 show. Right now, it is a one sided argument over on ORG2 show. No opposing viewpoint."

Maybe if we approached it from that standpoint we’d see the unhoused as humans with an unmet human need, and develop humane solutions to help get closer to meeting that need instead of criminalizing them and making cruelty the point.

Wild thought that actually empathizes with people, I know."

We can acknowledge defecating in public is problematic. On that we agree. We likely diverge in the severity of the problem. Statistically speaking, this is a non-issue in the scheme of things. It’s almost certainly a downstream issue of a larger problem — homelessness, displacement, individuals on the margins not having consistent access to facilities. And that’s a big problem, a nuanced one, and a problem criminalization only makes worse. You, on the other hand, seem to take the stance that this is a significant issue, that people are stepping in human feces on the regular, and it must be dealt with by bringing down the hammer of strong justice. We diverge there.

We can probably agree again that criminalization doesn’t always solve the problems it sets out to, and quite often makes things much worse for the individuals and society. That addict who gets caught with a few grams of crack or heroin, otherwise not one with any record or issues, jailed, their life prospects damaged; that doesn’t help the individual nor society, and takes away from both compared to appropriate rehabilitation and upstream measures.

And that’s the point you snarkily dismiss or completely fail to have [ORGANIZATION] empathy to acknowledge — that this isn’t an issue where criminalization does anything to solve the problem, remove someone dangerous from society (as should be the point of criminal justice, instead of locking up the non violent and diminishing rehabilitation prospects), or is severe enough to even be what it’s blown up to be because of the lying man child that is [ORGANIZATION]. 

So, tell me, how does criminalization help with this situation? How at all does it solve the problem, let alone solve it without creating bigger problems or perpetuate the existing upstream issues? Give us solutions, not conjecture."

Your stand point of ""If you build it, they will come.""   
Where I acknowledge that affordable housing continues to be a challenge, the best you can hope to do is serve the single Mom sleeping in her car because she lost her house or apartment.   
On that point, I agree.   
However, the people crapping on the sidewalk are those that have no concept of societal norms. Either through mental illness, substance abuse, or addiction.   
Not only do they not care about where they crap, they also don't care about whether or not they have a criminal record.   
You could expunge their record and give them a key to the penthouse in FAC0. [TIME] from now, you're going to find them squatting over dropped [PERSON]' in the middle of the [STREET].   
So, I'm sorry, but just ticketing them is going to do nothing but give them a piece of paper to wipe with. If they bother.   
And if this upsets you, it should. But you are dealing with ferals here."
66,2022-07-27 18:02:33 UTC,1,2022-07-31 18:11:30 UTC,[ORGANIZATION] fans turn anger toward [ORGANIZATION] city commissioner,"No doubt whatsoever there is a very small segment of the population that has severe issues and are thus predisposed to such bad behavior. 

Feral is a stronger term than I’d use for that, but I can acknowledge there are some who will always be on the margins. It doesn’t help matters when we’ve shut down some of the programs that existed to for those folks, like the mental health programs, and moved folks to the [STREET]. 

A significant population of the unhoused are former veterans. The statistics are unclear, but it appears to be 8%ish on the low end, 23%ish on the high end, 13%ish percent for the middle estimates. Either [STREET], disproportionately higher than the 6% of Americans that served. As we saw with the [ORGANIZATION] blocking veterans health programs DATE0 and other past moves, that population has been harmed.

Here’s where I’m going with this: I agree there’s a population of folks that will always be on the margins and were likely going to be that [STREET]. But we also know that there are downstream effects of even short term homelessness — meaning it doesn’t take long for a person who fell through the cracks to start succumbing to the very real strains of stress, anxiety, lack of physical safety, etc. for psychological impacts to spiral. 

Knowing there are veterans on the [STREET], and those you mention (the single moms), others who fall through the cracks in our society, and knowing when that happens it can be very tough to get out, is it not possible, or likely, that upstream efforts might be necessary to help avoid more folks who fall into this situation from becoming, to use your word, “feral”? And if we could commit to having reliable safety nets for the bulk of folks who do fall on hard times, the economic impact could be good for all of us, and then allow focused attention on those who would have been the worst off either [STREET]. 

No doubt, none of us want human feces in public. I’d just argue that issue is a distraction from the issue, and it’s easy to make this statistically small issue a focus because it’s shockingly gross, but when that’s the focus it distracts from the human issue in front of us and one that we might not be able to fully solve, but we can significantly impact…if we’d just be willing to see and address it instead of dusting our hands off as if all is futile. Criminalizing it also isn’t going to solve the problem, but it does create new ones, while distracting from possibilities to do more."

Density is key in a vibrant downtown as it keeps infrastructure maintenance and safety enforcement costs down. It's also what makes downtown feels.... downtown. 

There needs to be more amenities for the homeless and unfortunate populations especially around the [INSTITUTION] area. Many gather there for the shade and charity hand outs from non profit organizations. I think the city is very conflicted as more amenities means more homeless travel from other areas. If the city organizes a designated zone for them it will be safer and better managed and gives many the opportunity to get back on their feet."

It’s totally asinine how many homeless people turn down rehab opportunities or programs to help put them back on their feet in society.

They are not at the park because they sincerely WANT to live there. They are there to show us what it's like to be homeless. The garbage that piles up around them sucks for us to look at, but when they move back to where ever they originally came from - a doorway in an alley, an underpass, the transportation center - that garbage follows them. They didn't manufacture the garbage to be obnoxious. The garbage is an everyday occurrence in the life of a homeless person.

The reason they're at the park is to make people like you and me who would rather NOT see them aware of their DATE1 existence.

Everyone acknowledges a lack of affordable housing for those below the poverty line. I believe I read the best solution the city had was to build something by DATE2. That's a long [STREET] off. A lot of homeless are also mentally ill, and the fact that the government has been cutting budgets for mental heath doesn't help the problem. ([[URL]

Yes, they're breaking a law, but they're doing it to make a point about their desperate situation. If after [PERSON] of them in the park the city works towards more affordable housing, which in the long run means fewer homeless people on the streets in general, then it's a small price to pay.

You want to take the busiest part of the city, with the most intense traffic, and slow down the traffic’s movement through that area? I understand incentivizing walking, but if that is the plan you need to invest in much more than just these roads. You need to create somewhere for this traffic to go that isn’t on these two roads. You are going to create a headache for anyone going to [ORGANIZATION] or the east side of [ORGANIZATION]. Next is the walking itself. At the very least, that needs to be enjoyable. The homelessness issue downtown is already a major turn off for lots of people. However it gets solved, it does need solving. No one wants to walk through an area and be accosted for change multiple times in one short walk. Your going to be restricting access to areas which are being misused in the first [STREET]. This is going to make the idea of even traveling downtown even less appealing. We need better public transportation, for sure. The busses are getting old.

No, not in regards to walking around. Yes, the amount of people who are homeless has increase, but you can still walk around just about the same as always. I get online and I see all sorts of hyperbole about it, and then go downtown myself and I'm like ""what is all this online prattle about?""."

There needs to be changes made on other roads first that will compensate for what is being proposed for those two specific streets. As to the homelessness issue, I think the culture of [ORGANIZATION]’s homeless has become a big issue. It is one thing to hold a sign on a [STREET] corner, and it’s an entirely different thing to follow a woman and child to their car and pound on their window. It is most prevalent in the vine neighborhood. I think, before housing can even be floated as an idea, addiction services need to be provided and followed. There needs to be less of an attitude that the city can just save people, and more an attitude that we will do everything we can, but the people receiving help need to put in the work as well.

This is an important point here. I can't speak to your case, but people often make a lot of assumptions about people being homeless. I live by several adult foster care homes and I see those residents out and about all the time. People think and assume they are homeless based on a variety of factors, but they are  housed. They just hang out in public during [ORGANIZATION], as we all have the right to do. Obviously, following people is not cool at all though for sure. I'm glad you made it home safe."

The [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood - the neighborhood people on [ORGANIZATION] regularly shit on, calling it a dangerous area; this neighborhood wants nothing to do with these juulpods. IMO - the path of least resistance with these juulpods is going to be a location in rural [ORGANIZATION]. The city should look for farm/vacant land, with very few residents that would oppose it. 

I still think the juulpod idea is dumb. [ORGANIZATION] should provide tax abatements, expedited re-zoning & permitting, and work with ORG2 to secure more grants/subsidies/funding to build more section-8 housing. And - make this housing nice enough to please residents. In this regard; these juulpods are offensively embarrassing - to the people living in them, and to the people who call [PERSON] their home. So when I say housing - I mean a high rise.

[PERSON] Downtown is undergoing a revitalization - hotels, condominiums, mixed use towers, an arena. Therefore, I think it makes sense to take those [ORGANIZATION] funds, donations from the community (the juulpod money as an example) - and partner with a real estate development company that specializes in building these. They should build a [TIME] story-ish tall building with a large amount of units ([DATE]-100 units). The units don’t have to be massive - 400 square feet will do. Because of the density - it would make providing services easier. Things like bus routes, trash collection, medical services - all could be easier to coordinate. Plus the area could be secured much easier - than a bunch of random juulpods. The homeless could have [ORGANIZATION] badges issued to enter the building, and there 24x7 security staff could much easier patrol a building than a bunch of juulpods.

[ORGANIZATION], a real estate investor worth between 250-500mn dollars (also a popular [ORGANIZATION] who advocates for real estate investment), showed off one of his high rise properties that is specifically for low income/section-8/homeless people. It is a lovely property - respectable for those who live in it, and something the community can be proud of. This is an example of what people should be asking for, IMO.

Anything else is just offensive - to the community, and to the people who are homeless. We’re trying to solve homelessness here, not make a shanty town of shitty houses that will be laughed at by everyone, before the juulpods fall apart.

None of them are complete losers, or lazy bums.  Many (most!) are addicts and/or mentally ill.

The ones that don't fall in to either of these two categories are very transitory, easily helped, and back on their feet in an apartment or home quickly.  While these people do need help, and we should try and do more, they aren't the ones that we're talking about when it comes to these camps.  It's the before mentioned addicts and mentally ill.

I'm not one for euphemisms, there's a few blue haired hildabeasts on here that use ""unhoused"" as though that makes them sooo much better and more caring than people who don't, and because of that I am hesitant to urge you not to call people ""lazy bums"", but I must nonetheless present my argument that you do not do so.

These are human beings who because of mental illness and addiction are incapable of making basic decisions in regards to their lives.  It can be difficult because what we see when we deal with them on an individual level is an adult, maybe a little (or a lot) ""off"", but otherwise a functional adult, when in reality they lack the capacity to  help themselves.  

If anyone deserves contempt, I strongly urge you to hold those preventing forced treatment/commitment of these people in contempt. Many of those complaining about your post, for example, would oppose any effort to actually help these people as being ""mean"" or ""cruel"", and champion letting them live in a tent city as if it is some great thing.

Or, completely disregard everything I've written, but please reconsider whether or not you want to judge addicts and the mentally ill as lazy bums, as opposed to ""unfortunate motherfuckers"" that ""homeless advocates"" would rather keep addicted and unmedicated until they're dead from exposure, rather than promote policies of involuntary commitment and treatment."

Being homeless and doing criminal stuff = menace to society

Crime is a slippery slope. Police have supposedly seen positive results when they use some strategy called “broken windows” prosecution & enforcement. The idea is; small crimes that are overlooked (like drunk and disorderly, public intoxication, public urination, petty theft, malicious destruction of property) result in greater frequency of serious crimes like murder and rape. It creates an environment where petty criminals flourish, home values get depressed, neighborhoods get “rough”….

I’m not sure what a better approach is. But if there are roaming maniacal meth heads or homeless people terrorizing society (loosely speaking); they need to be stopped."

1. Would you consider a housing first solution to address homeless citizens of [ORGANIZATION]?

33,2019-10-27 02:03:18 UTC,7,2019-10-27 12:44:11 UTC,[ORGANIZATION] Q&A,The homeless situation definitely needs to be addressed in [ORGANIZATION].
33,2019-10-27 02:03:18 UTC,6,2019-10-28 23:25:01 UTC,[ORGANIZATION] Q&A,"Yes, I do support housing first solutions in [ORGANIZATION]. A lack of stable housing exacerbates every issue folks have that keep them in the cycle of poverty and homelessness. It is a sad fact that our city has more empty houses than homeless people. It makes sense to get people in housing first and then offer the supportive services needed to keep them there.

I do also support the establishment of safe injection sites for several reasons. 1. They operate on the principle of harm reduction. People using safe sites are much less likely to die from their drug dependence and that is huge. 2. It is much easier to convince people to accept services when they're in a supportive environment. 3. It reduces the strain on our public safety and emergency services by keeping them from spending their time running between overdoses and arresting people for chemical addictions."
33,2019-10-27 02:03:18 UTC,2,2019-10-29 01:16:23 UTC,[ORGANIZATION] Q&A,"The first step is setting standards for what affordable housing means. Right now, our definitions of area median income ([ORGANIZATION]) is set at a county level. However, since the city of [ORGANIZATION] has a much lower [ORGANIZATION] than the county, that standard doesn't really work for us. What's affordable in [PERSON] or [ORGANIZATION] isn't affordable in [ORGANIZATION]. 

Secondly, we need to find a [STREET] to hold developers to a higher standard when asking for support from the city in terms of tax breaks and other incentives. Their focus right now is on ""workforce housing"", a lose industry term that refers to housing at 80-120% of [ORGANIZATION]. These new units are mostly studio and one bedroom, starting at about $800 DATE0, which obviously is out of reach for many of the populations that struggle most with housing. 

3rd, we need a land bank that is transparent and fair. The county land bank is controlled by [ORGANIZATION], and she has almost total discretion over who gets to purchase properties and at what price. If the city was able to take control over abandoned and foreclosed properties, use their rehabilitation as an opportunity to train the local workforce, they could sell those houses in core neighborhoods at a much lower price. 

We also need to look at some of the zoning and property maintenance standards that are currently pushing low income homeowners out of their existing homes. I have a friend who bought a house off FAC0. A very low income single mom, she managed to scrape together enough cash for a real fixer upper. DATE1, the city issued a hefty fine for not having siding on her house, a fine that was more than the entire cost of the siding. That doesn't make any sense. 

Infilling older vacant city lots with smaller and more energy efficient homes would also be helpful. it would also require changing some local building and zoning codes, but would allow for development in neighborhoods gutted by historic redlining and the housing crash. 

Unfortunately all of the candidate events are over. DATE2 before the election is all outreach and canvassing. Here are some links to other appearances. These are my two most extensive interviews.

33,2019-10-27 02:03:18 UTC,2,2019-10-29 01:29:21 UTC,[ORGANIZATION] Q&A,It costs us far more in resources to allow people to stay homeless than it does to actually house people when you look at the associated costs to our health system and public safety.

The government cellphones don’t cost a thing. I see booths set up around my part of town (e. FAC0) that encourage people to come sign up for a free phone. 

And tbh the world of technology we live in now considers a cell phone to be a basic need, and rightfully so. There aren’t any more pay phones, or they are at least few and far between. Society is dependent on technology. Being homeless is hard enough. I despise that these asshats ruined the park for such a long time, but they are people. They are humans. They are important to someone, even if they aren’t even a blip on my radar, every person in that park has value and is special and important to someone. They deserve basic human kindness and it is society’s duty to care for and support each other. I am totally ok with my tax dollars being used to buy a phone and service for someone who can’t do it for themselves. Life is already hard enough. We can provide this support to have available basic human needs. 

I do get what you’re saying. I was jealous of the camp sites down there. They got better shit than I do. And I work my ass off to keep my head just above water. But it is a little bit on the ignorant side to just assume that a homeless person should not be entitled to basic needs. Or even something better.

I feel like your thread is a little dishonest, although maybe not intentionally. The gospel mission's environment isn't bad because of the gospel mission staff. To my knowledge they aren't the ones assaulting, stealing, or exposing themselves. The problem is the homeless population has a lot of untreated mental health problems which leads to these altercations.  When you take the homeless people out of the mission the crime rate doesn't drop to zero, it just gets reported less and they have less help. 

>Before you pass judgement, please try to consider the perspective of someone who is homeless and understand that they are likely trying to simply give themselves the small shred of dignity that they don't otherwise get within the ""system"".


This is the heart of the problem here at least in [ORGANIZATION]. They are adults and adults want and theoretically deserve autonomy. When people have their own homes they have this autonomy but once they are relying on others they have to follow those rules. They lose a lot of their autonomy but that is just life. When you go to someone else's house you follow their rules, the most we can do is help them get back in their feet so they can regain their autonomy."

Out of all of the homeless, plenty are just unfortunate folk who are homeless for various reasons, and then there are \*some\* bums.  I mean straight up dirty, scary, steal-your-shit and harass-you-for-money.  Until recently, they mostly congregated in a concentrated area by the [INSTITUTION], as there are two shelters there.  However, the shelters have recently made some changes to how strict they are enforcing their rules (you know, silly shit like don't be a rapist and don't be high when you're here).  
[ORGANIZATION], said bums have decided to ""protest"" (be bums) in the main park.  They've pitched tents.  I shit you not.  And although it's not legal to camp in the park, they're being permitted to do so for now.  As a matter of fact, they are being encouraged to stay there as the City Manager has installed portable toilets and that type of thing.  
Of course there is a lot more to it, history, and nuance, and liberul tears, and whatnot.  


But as a visitor to our fair land, please just ignore the bums and enjoy your stay.

They were all affordable housing advocates and not residents of the [[ORGANIZATION] neighborhood]([URL]  Some of them were members of [ORGANIZATION]).

The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit ([ORGANIZATION] - often pronounced ""lie-tech"", [ORGANIZATION]) is a dollar-for-dollar tax credit in [ORGANIZATION] for affordable housing investments.  It was created under the Tax Reform Act of DATE0 (TRA86) and gives incentives for the utilization of private equity in the development of affordable housing aimed at low-income Americans. [ORGANIZATION] accounts for the majority (approximately 90%) of all affordable rental housing created in [ORGANIZATION] DATE1.

**Mixed-use development**

Mixed-use development is a type of urban development that blends residential, commercial, cultural, institutional, or entertainment uses, where those functions are physically and functionally integrated, and that provides pedestrian connections. Mixed-use development can take the form of a single building, a city block, or entire neighbourhoods. The term may also be used more specifically to refer to a mixed-use real estate development project—a building, complex of buildings, or district of a town or city that is developed for mixed-use by a private developer, (quasi-) governmental agency, or a combination thereof.

Traditionally, human settlements have developed in mixed-use patterns.

If you don’t think the city is doing enough, why don’t you take your personal resources and apply them to the problem. Maybe open an extra bedroom in your home for free to a homeless family. Better yet fundraise, buy a multi-unit property, pay the taxes, pay for the upkeep and maintenance, pay all the bills (gas, electric, water), the insurance (liability and property), and let the homeless live there free of charge.

A thriving downtown is about maximizing the number of people who live, work, and play there. A long-term sustainable, integrated system.

Right now, people *want* to live downtown. But it’s too expensive and even at those sky high rents, the occupancy rate is 99%. Meanwhile homelessness keeps increasing. Let the people live downtown.

Without governmental redistribution of funds, there is no such thing as affordable housing. The cost to build is so high that the rent/mortgage is never going to be affordable. We lost so many housing units over [ORGANIZATION], and the replacements didn't keep pace with the population and changing living trends.   


[ORGANIZATION] did a big zoning overhaul DATE1 and that did help make more development possible. The problem is that the only ones that are affordable are governmentally subsidized, so the amount of affordable housing we get is tied to how much governmental funds are available. I know of few (if any) local cases where zoning was the hold up for huge housing complexes since these changes. It's usually funding that's the issue."

I'll try to find the video but I watch a lot of city planning videos and what not on youtube and one went over this exact situation in a pair of towns in [PERSON]. There was a town (unfortunitally the name eludes me) and then a community of wealthier people decided to make their own little town/village just a short [STREET] away that was going to be all residential (like they actually made rules that no buisnesses could open there) so they were basically required to [STREET] to the original town if they needed groceries or wanted to do any sort of shopping. The original town started taking out parking and lowering minimums and the newer town freaked out and called it an attack on them because with less parking the people in the original town could access the shops fine but the people that had no choice but to commute in had a harder time. It's just ridiculous.

This forum loves to hate on [ORGANIZATION], but they are the exact kind of solution to this problem, if you are trying to solve the problem with detached single family homes. $500 down payment gets your house built, in [ORGANIZATION] when your house is done and close; you just need to come up with 1% down payment with one of their preferred lenders to get the house with [ORGANIZATION]. Or if you have 0% down financing thru your own lender, you can do that with [ORGANIZATION] as well (and I think [ORGANIZATION] loans and have no [ORGANIZATION]). I've quoted [ORGANIZATION] recently and you can still build homes for [ORGANIZATION] without all the upgrades. So for like $800/mo in mortgage (not including insurance/taxes); you can live in a brand new [ORGANIZATION] entry level energy efficient house that is free of asbestos, mold, lead paint, lead water lines. There are other builders who can do this, too. IMO, people don't want basic stuff, especially if they going thru all the work of having it built. It's a very underwhelming experience. Like buying a new car - but getting the cheapest model without any upgrades. Most people would rather try for a used, cooler car that they would enjoy more; even if it meant having no warranty and higher out of pocket costs. 

All that debate aside; every city needs more RM1 zoning. Every.single.city. It is the solution to the housing crisis. More inventory, More units will result in lower prices."

And sorry it took a while to get back to you. I am no expert on housing, so I wanted to make sure to look back at what folks have shared with me on these issues. 

Another TL;DR (sorry, I'm a politician)

I believe that we need to construct more diverse middle housing options for folks, and what I mean by that is housing options in neighborhoods that are not just detached single-family homes. We should construct more duplexes, four-plexes, multiplexes, townhomes, etc.: house-scale buildings with  multiple units which are just as livable and also more affordable. In much of the [ORGANIZATION], it is illegal to build anything other than detached single-family homes in suburban neighborhoods, and that oftentimes alienates people who cannot afford that type of housing. I believe that this needs to be changed. In order to do this, however, I want to avoid imposing state-wide zoning laws and instead create incentives for local governments to make changes to their zoning codes. Overall, constructing more middle housing options in our neighborhoods will boost supply and affordability, ultimately making it much easier for folks to find good homes.  
We also need to go after developers who intentionally leave housing empty. If you’re priced beyond what is reasonable and are leaving homes empty, we leave the housing supply low for no reason except future profits. I want to explore all legal options to compel property owners to rent out units to those who have housing vouchers, or to keep rent within a reasonable price for the location of the property. Empty luxury apartments don’t do us any good.   
Another piece that could help is transitional housing, such as housing pods. I know projects within the city of [PERSON] have worked hard to purchase a few of these, but I believe we need more transitional housing options and services available for those who need them. Additionally, the state should provide more permanent grants and funding solutions to cities and townships that are working on transitional housing, so these resources can be available for the long haul.  These are significantly more important than apartments or other housing options for the unhoused, and can be seen as a [STREET] to help people get back into their own apartments with the resources they need.

But, what am I missing? I'd love your perspectives on housing supply as well."

There are some gorgeous lofts on the pedestrian mall, and I believe [PERSON] own the lofts across from the library (corner of FAC2 and [PERSON]). You might want to check those out.

Otherwise, I'd suggest looking at the southern part of [ORGANIZATION], near the [PERSON] area, particularly if you enjoy biking. Also, [ORGANIZATION] isn't exactly a hotbed of crime, but south [ORGANIZATION] is much safer and quieter than downtown [PERSON].

When nobody wants you anywhere where do you go?

While lack of affordable housing is making the problem worse, the stigma around homelessness usually is centered around substance abuse and mental health issues. People have horrible mental health issues that they can’t afford to treat so they use alcohol or drugs (which is sadly often the cheaper option) to deal with their problems. Even if they are able to get clean (either through the [STREET] system or charity) and get mental health treatment they often have difficulty finding and maintaining a job and stable [STREET] to live. As a result they end up at shelters where their meds are stolen and the cycle begins again. The vast majority of the homeless are stuck in this endless loop.

63,2023-03-07 13:23:32 UTC,8,2023-03-08 08:18:39 UTC,cop city,"They DO have free health care. My husband and I housed a mentally ill person who had been homeless for [ORGANIZATION]. We did it for two [ORGANIZATION]. During that period, she went to [LOCATION] about twice a week and had regular doctor appointments and paid nothing (this is in [ORGANIZATION]).  We never charged her any rent and only asked her to pay her own utilities. She ended up stiffing us on about 300 bucks in utility bills and that's after I also bought her groceries, more than once, and paid a 1200. vet bill for her. She also ruined furniture and never cleaned anything. My husband and I are also low income so on top emotionally distressing, it cost us a lot of the little money we have.

My point in telling you this is to point out two things: First, if people are really so concerned, then they need to do what we did. Put their time and money where their  mouths are and *provide direct help*. Anything less is empty virtue signaling because these homeless addicts and metal cases are NOT some kind of general responsibility  of everybody and no community has an obligation to be subjected to that shit in parks or any other public places because it's dangerous. It's a terrible problem and very damn few actually do what we did. Second, when doing what we did, be prepared for reality and the fact that it probably won't end well.

I so get your compassion because I'm that [STREET], too. Nevertheless, for anyone to take on the responsibility of someone who cannot or refuses to be responsible for their own actions is a monumental and extremely stressful endeavor. Also it is 100% true that when people are given something for nothing, they become entitled and even more inclined to blame others and eschew personal responsibility.  What to do about them? I don't fucking know.  Just let this serve as a warning. Temper compassion with common sense. Respect yourself, first and foremost and keep in mind that the vast majority of the chronically homeless population don't respect you. I know that sounds harsh but it is what it is. 

This problem has become epidemic in this country. What they are doing in places like [PERSON], GPE2, [PERSON], [PERSON], etc, isn't working and is making it worse. Any efforts in [PERSON] to stop it from being another crime infested shithole are good. The OP is full of shit."

I’m not stupid enough to think that my suggestion will solve ALL homelessness or the problems associated with it. There will always be people who are willing to take advantage of the system and others (both homeless and not homeless).

In terms of healthcare the [LOCATION] is a special case. If you go to the [LOCATION] (anyone) they have to treat you regardless of your ability to pay. This legislation was passed because prior to that [LOCATION]s could turn you away if you looked to poor to pay (even if you were actively dying) or require you to pay up front (which most people could not do). People were dying from very treatable illness and injuries. So we, as a country, decided that access to the [LOCATION] was a protected right. However, the [LOCATION] is the most expensive [STREET] to treat anything. This had the unexpected result that many people’s only option for treatment is the [LOCATION]. The treatment isn’t free but when you can’t pay they have to write it off (and you get a ding on your credit history if you provide correct info). 

As for other forms of “free healthcare” there are [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]. Neither of which are without costs but are the closest thing we have to “free healthcare”. 

[ORGANIZATION] is the government subsidized healthcare for poor people. It isn’t free (there are still copays) but you don’t have to pay a premium and the copays are significantly less than average insurance. In GPE0 [ORGANIZATION] (with a couple of exceptions) is covered by private insurance companies. These companies are paid by the state to provide this insurance. The problems comes when finding someone who takes this insurance. Generally providers are few and far between. They legally have to provide some access but will often partner with providers that are extremely far apart. This means someone on [ORGANIZATION] may be able to find a primary care but if they need a neurologist they may have to travel several cities away. As you might imagine this is difficult for people who have reliable transportation but impossible for most homeless. You can probably find a therapist easily but the psychiatrist you need is over in [P[ORGANIZATION]SON] or GPE2. You technically have “access” so the insurance company is providing their end and gets paid the premiums by the state. It is also important to note that [ORGANIZATION] has copays but they are not paid at the time of service. Rather, the state will tally up your copays and you pay them [ORGANIZATION] (maybe [P[ORGANIZATION]SON]… can’t quite remember). Medication isn’t remotely close to free either. In fact it is probably the most expensive component. Many meds are simply not covered at all and again there are copays associated (and added to your bill to the government) that make it difficult to reliably access medications. Even most meds that have subsidies have language that prevents those subsidies from being used by those with [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]. 

[ORGANIZATION] is the government subsidized healthcare provided to older people and people determined to be disabled (which can include being a kid in certain circumstances). While people over a certain age automatically qualify for this benefit, disabled people are required to go through a very long process to apply for the benefits. This is at shortest a DATE2 long process and at longest (for those who actually get it) [P[ORGANIZATION]SON] and often requires working with a lawyer. While you do not technically need a home address to qualify it is going to be very difficult to apply and keep receiving [ORGANIZATION] benefits without a permanent address. [ORGANIZATION] does partner with more doctors than ORG2 (though partially because it isn’t run through private insurance companies). You do have copays and premiums but if you make below a certain amount [P[ORGANIZATION]SON] you can apply for “extra help” which helps to pay a portion or all of your premiums and copays. It essentially takes the money that would be spent by the government on having [ORGANIZATION] as well and applies it to your copays and premiums. [ORGANIZATION] also has prescription coverage but that is provided by private insurance that is subsidized by [ORGANIZATION]. Rarely are meds free (even with extra help) but there are far more meds provided under the insurance than [ORGANIZATION] and therefore costs are generally more affordable for the average person. 

I’m going to guess that the person that stayed with you most likely had disability as there is no [STREET] they could afford a dog without a job. Disability payments are rarely enough to afford rent (especially in this market), food, utilities, and healthcare (even with the reduced costs due to [ORGANIZATION]). As a result they often end up out on the streets and/or off meds that helped them.

I do think it is society’s responsibility to provide for the ill and this includes many of the homeless. There have been a number of studies that have shown that providing a social safety net actually increases return on investment (less likely to use services like the [LOCATION] or needing to involve the police). If provided housing in their time of need homeless individuals are unlikely to need to be provided that housing again. However individual members of society are rarely equipped to provide this safety net themselves. It is far better to provide the money (in terms of taxes and/or charities) and allow people who are qualified with the problems to provide help. In addition, there is a reduction in price due to working in larger volumes. Larger volumes don’t [ORGANIZATION] work (lord knows “the projects” were an epic fail) but they work in a lot of circumstances. If the government can buy medications in bulk instead of one person at a time it is far cheaper. It is the same for paying for providers. Paying a provider directly to work for the government is cheaper (and the provider gets more money) than paying a company to pay a company to pay the provider."
63,2023-03-07 13:23:32 UTC,24,2023-03-07 19:34:09 UTC,cop city,"This is such a straw man argument. Other countries are able to provide affordable housing and healthcare while still living in a free market economy.
 
As for welcoming them into my home, should I invite them into my small bedroom I rent (not a 1-bedroom apartment but just a bedroom with a shared bath and kitchen)? Not much room for two of us in here. As for their healthcare, I can barely afford my own care, which is the case for a large portion of the population. 

So where can the money come from?… tax the rich and you will find the resources. We give tax breaks to those who don’t need it to survive or even live comfortably while breaking the back of those who are barely making ends meet. 

If we can provide care and housing for people and keep them from this vicious cycle it will actually bolster the economy. Fewer resources will be needed to “deal with” this population (police resources, unpaid [ORGANIZATION] bills, vandalism, etc) and many of its members can actually become a working and living member of general society. If you listen/read the stories and AMAs from homeless people you will start to understand that there are many challenges that prevent these people from reentering “normal” society (even if they don’t have any issues with drug use or the law). Many applications require a home address in order to apply. Other applications are thrown out if you do not check the box that says you have reliable transportation. If you and your clothes are not clean and well kept at the interview you will often be passed over for a job. Not to mention you need access to the internet and know how to use it in order to apply for most positions now. All of these are further complicated if you HAVE had issues with the law… even if that was simple loitering or trespassing because you were sleeping rough or were trying to get warm or cool and were deemed “unwelcome”. 

The not saying that solving homelessness will be easy. I also am not stupid enough to think all associated problems will go away with providing a safe space to live and access to affordable healthcare. However, when provided these services the homeless had better well-being and were less likely to need further assistance in the future. (one reference for data"

I only quoted you so you'd know what I was replying to.  I have a quick question.

If this foundation has been running and doing all of these things, why is homelessness getting worse, crime going up, and our parks becoming junkie dens?"
21,2021-07-28 16:54:51 UTC,1,2021-07-29 18:44:20 UTC,[ORGANIZATION] to make ‘historic’ announcement [ORGANIZATION],"1. Solving homelessness at a local level is a fool's errand. It's a systemic, nationwide problem, and the more money and resources you provide and make available locally, the more you draw those in need from around the region. If [ORGANIZATION] provides more assistance, why would you live homeless in [PERSON]? I'm not saying that low income housing efforts or social programs aren't the fix (and I champion those efforts) but it can't be done peacemeal in some cities and not others. There will **always** be demand for below market rent. It needs to be tackled at a federal level.

2. I don't think the charter of the foundation was to bolster, fund, or reform [ORGANIZATION]'s criminal justice system. 

3. There are plenty of other factors at play that the foundation doesn't have the latitude to address - covid shutdowns, unemployment in the private sector, etc. A lot of this contributes to the issues you've described. 

Quite a few of the foundations goals are to solve the unsexy, behind the scenes problems like city pensions, tax shortfalls, and making the city attractive to investment to solve the biggest issue facing [ORGANIZATION]: the eroding tax base. A strong city tax base makes available funds to improve the quality of life and maintain government function even in down [ORGANIZATION]. Since a large amount of the properties in downtown [ORGANIZATION] are non-profit or tax exempt (looking at you [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, and [PERSON]), the impact of recessions and downturns has made the business tax base go down, and property taxes have to make up the slack. There's little buffer when there are company closures or down [ORGANIZATION].

If the foundation is successful at reducing the barriers to entry for new investment and companies within the city, and if it makes the city operate more efficiently, in the long term there should be improvement in the areas you've described. 

Solving homelessness and crime isn't done by throwing money at the problem overnight - it's a systematic attack at the large problems facing the city. They're playing the long-game."

Sure. Its normal housekeeping with a fancy new dress to wear for [ORGANIZATION].

>[ORGANIZATION]’s presentation shows how the money would be spent for aspirational projects: including $500,000 for lead service replacements; $1.8 million categorized under great neighborhoods: infrastructure and parks; $100,000 for neighborhood activation and engagement; $825,000 for [ORGANIZATION] youth employment; $134,000 for All Things Possible; $175,000 for [ORGANIZATION]; $100,000 for digital access for all; $1.93 million for economic development; $2.4 million for affordable housing; $92,000 for home energy efficiency audits; and $469,000 for personnel and program costs.

- Sounds like the bulk of it is for replacing lead water pipes (which I am in total support of.) 

- $2.4 million for affordable housing as part of a $400 million dollar donations sounds a lot like how ORG2 got $500,000,000 and **still raised tuition rates for the students.** I.E. Not really any exciting news for us regular [ORGANIZATION] citizens."

Not to mention that if we’re trying to follow a social principle that seeks to meet the basic needs of everyone — meaning that everyone has shelter, food, and potable water — then we should be seeing to the needs of addicts and the mentally ill among everyone else. Ensuring housing for the addicted and the mentally sick is a support to the addiction and mental health services that we should be building in parallel to housing services.

If your takeaway about the “unhoused” label is that it’s an attempt to obfuscate other social issues that we still need to address, then I’m not sure I trust how you approach these issues, or your analysis on how these issues impact and compound each other."

This is such a dumbfuck rebuttal to the position that building housing services to house the unhomed is necessary. Please point me to where I propose that mental health and addiction services are not also things we need to build.

#You can’t because I already said we need them

> Treatment ~~is~~ **should be** mandatory, and should be compulsory since the opposite is abandoning people in need.

You’re trying to pick a fight on a topic where we agree concerning the necessity of ensuring mental health and addiction services are available and active. However, our differences on this topic is that you’re signaling that people need to be required to engage those services or lose their shelter, so I have to ask you; how is that not abandoning people in need?"

Great, me neither.

> because a bunch of pussies are too worried about offending people and denying autonomy to people who are so fucked up they have the judgement capacities of [ORGANIZATION] children

This is an essentialist generalization and is part of the reason you’re getting a lot of pushback. Are all addicts so fucked up they can’t reason? Are all mentally ill people so deluded or detached that they can’t reason? My answer is no, and we should be concerned about the respecting the autonomy of people. The severe cases that you’ve painted onto the entirety of the issue *do* need a different approach than those with less severe conditions, and I *agree* that those severe cases are going to need more attentive and supervised care.

But that’s a thing we need to determine on a case by case basis.

> Now, I understand that it may be a radical idea to create a space where they can live and be made well

This is not that radical, since you and I agree on creating living spaces where the unhoused can live, attend to their health, and begin rebuilding their lives.

> and to compel that, but the alternative is their needless suffering and deaths out on the [STREET].  I would like for that not to happen.

This is the radical portion. Compulsory treatment for addiction and mental health as a broad policy for housing the unhomed doesn’t make sense if we’re trying to address the needs of the individuals who are unhoused. I think it would be a misapplication of resources, since some cases are going to need more attention than others. I don’t know if you want broad compulsory treatment for the unhoused, but it is how you’re coming across when you generalize the unhoused population as mentally ill and drug addicted to the point where its hard for them to differentiate up from down.

While I think it’s possible that that kind of compulsory treatment might be necessary in severe cases, certainly I don’t believe it’s necessary in all cases.

> I believe your proposal, and I don't want to put words into your mouth, is that we don't do this, but instead hand them keys to apartments/other housing and say ""if you want help we'll provide it, otherwise shoot up to your hearts content and/or scream at godzilla"".

The proposals I support are housing first, yes. But I do not support proposals or policy action which neglects addiction or mental health services. Similarly, I don’t support proposals which hinge housing upon required compulsory treatment, because I see that as a course which undermines housing first policies which might feed into a prison pipeline that’s entirely unnecessary.

> I get that you want to compare a treatment/rehab facility as a prison, and to some extents it is, but here's the good news, all they have to do to leave is get better.  And until then, they're not freezing to death, robbing grandma, OD'ing, and jumping in front of trains.

Here’s another [STREET] where I think you’re generalizing the unhoused. This is not the solution for all unhoused individuals, and I think you already recognize that. There are a myriad of issues within mental wellness treatment centers and addiction rehabilitation centers that need to be addressed as well with the general and implied proposal that the unhoused need to go through these institutions in order to enjoy secured housing.

We’re not going to zero out the bad shit that stems from these issues in either case, but a home address first into treatment second at least allows us, as a society, to know that we’re trying to build people up from a halfway decent foundation.

> Now, if I understood you correctly you want the junkies and mentally ill people with brains that don't function correctly to be the captains of their own destiny as far as treatment? 

Again, you’re generalizing the entire unhoused community and characterizing them all as incapable of making their own choices. It seems like you’re unfamiliar with the concept that we cannot force others to change. It is impossible. In extreme cases, perhaps that kind of rigid supervision is necessary, but it is certainly not necessary in every case. It’s astonishing to me that you would be proposing this idea under a human interest story of a case that obviously was not extreme enough to necessitate what you’re putting forward.

What I want is for us to apply nuance and treat individual homeless people as individuals with specific needs by the systems we build in order to fulfill those needs. I do not want to treat this problem in a [STREET] that sees the systems which are supposed to address these issues like hammers, and the people who need those services as nails.

> That sounds insane to me, so I truly hope I misunderstood you.

That’s good, because you did. Because those aren’t my positions. They’re straw men that you whipped up."

They definitely shouldn't have lied and said it was a gun, but the kid or kids shouldn't have been doing that in the first [STREET]. There's no reason at all to bring a loaded water gun into a library in [ORGANIZATION]."

> On [ORGANIZATION], a shift in language has happened organically as the demographics of the homeless population have changed. In [ORGANIZATION], owing to growing wage gaps and high costs of living, there has been an increase in the number of people who are newly homeless. Here, one of the preferred terms is “unhoused,” which denotes that people are being pushed out of their dwelling units by inequitable housing policies."

I want to know: 

Would you sanction police firing teargas on peaceful protestors?

How do you feel about a religious organization ([ORGANIZATION])  buying up approximately a dozen properties with the goal of establishing a theocratic city? (Plus removing tax income from the city!)

Why are dozens of pods for homeless people still sitting in storage?

Why does the city feel the need to partner with private companies to surveil its citizens?

and so on....

Seriously, hang out in ORG1 for [ORGANIZATION] and find out what is really bothering people.

I would also appreciate a little more transparency regarding the candidates. 

[ORGANIZATION] husband is a realtor. She should state how she will partition his business interests against the interests of the city. (Perhaps as a realtor he wouldn't want the pods or affordable housing eating into his business.)

I'm pretty sure [PERSON] owns a multi-unit low income housing building. Is this affecting his opinion on homeless housing and setting up the pods?

I'm just a guy who lives in [ORGANIZATION] and if I come come up with conflicts like this, I expect A [ORGANIZATION] more from your organization and the media in general."
