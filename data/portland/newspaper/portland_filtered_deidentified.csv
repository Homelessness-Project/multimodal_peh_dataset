[PERSON] and challenger [PERSON] have both unveiled plans to reduce homelessness in [ORGANIZATION]. They deserve credit for elevating homelessness to a top issue in the governors race. Their solutions, if implemented, will resonate throughout [ORGANIZATION], including [PERSON]. One study said the county had one of the nations highest rates of homelessness. But the GPE2-based [ORGANIZATION], which is analyzing the countys homelessness and need for shelter beds, said the county also has a remarkable level of community engagement in the issue of homelessness.

Indeed, the ORG1 newspaper in [ORGANIZATION] editorialized [ORGANIZATION] that [ORGANIZATION] was doing far more on homelessness than the state capital was. But much more must be done... in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] and elsewhere. And while it is tempting to compare the candidates competing proposals, such comparisons would be inaccurate, irrelevant and ultimately inconclusive. The reasons are managerial, political and economic."
portland,2018-09-12T00:00:00Z,Associated Press State & Local,The Oregonian,homelessness,Editorials from around [ORGANIZATION],"State action on homelessness hinges on the central issue in the governors race. Would Democratic Gov. [PERSON] or Republican Rep. [PERSON] be the more effective leader? The governors most important role arguably is as CEO of state government. That requires the wisdom to hire effective staff, including agency directors the leadership to get state agencies working in the same direction and the tenacity to keep atop that work instead of jumping from priority to priority. Candidates always campaign on their vision for the state. The electorate must assess whether they have the skills, expertise and experience to convert that vision into reality, whether on homelessness or any other issue."

Hollowed out by the pandemic, which banished office workers and tourists, the neighborhood became the site of massive demonstrations against police brutality2 after the murder of [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON], protesters faced off against local and federal law enforcement in DATE4 clashes that inevitably ended in tear gas, flash-bang grenades, and arrests. Even after direct actions became small and sporadic, many storefronts remained boarded upa detail often mentioned in a barrage of media coverage characterizing GPE2 as dangerous, trashed, even dying.1 Resurrecting downtown [ORGANIZATION], and the citys image, has been a major focus for [DATE]3or PERSON1 and other city leaders [PERSON]. By the reopening event, much of the plywood had come down the band [LOCATION] led a sing-along for a crowd in FAC0, and city commissioners [LOCATION], PERSON3, and [ORGANIZATION] cut a red ribbon to mark the opening of a new pod of food carts, several of which had been displaced from their previous location a few blocks north by the construction of a 35-story tower that will house 138 luxury condos and a [ORGANIZATION] hotel. [ORGANIZATION] is the beginning of a new [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] told the crowd.2 What this new [ORGANIZATION] should look likeand whom it should serveremains a matter of fierce debate. To many [ORGANIZATION]ers, [PERSON] of sustained protest that followed [PERSON] murder were historic, electrifying, and potentially transformational for a city with a deep history3 of racial exclusion and police violence. [ORGANIZATION]s Black residents, who make up 6 percent of the citys population, have for DATE8 endured harassment from police officers. The city has one of the worst racial disparities in arrests in [LOCATION], and for DATE9 the [ORGANIZATION] Police Bureau has been under the supervision of ORG7 because of a pattern of using excessive force against people with mental illness. Though efforts to reform the bureau began DATE8 before DATE10 uprising, never before had so many white residents been attuned to the issue. Longtime activists sensed a remarkable opportunity. Aint nobody scared of police no more, [ORGANIZATION], who founded the [ORGANIZATION] chapter of [ORGANIZATION] in [DATE], said recently. If I dont see nothing else, Ive seen how it came together here.3 After DATE12 of demonstrations, the police chief stepped down. ORG9 redirected 15 million from policing to communities of color and to [ORGANIZATION] [STREET] Response, a non-police pilot program intended to assist people in mental health crises, and dissolved a handful of controversial police units. In DATE13, 80 percent of [ORGANIZATION] voters approved a new independent police oversight board, which will have the power to discipline and fire officers for misconduct. It was understood that all of this would be only a start toward making the whitest major [PERSON] in GPE4 more equitable. Black-led organizations developed a sweeping agenda to dismantle systemic racism not only in policing but also in housing, transportation, education, economic development, and health care across the state.4 But some [ORGANIZATION]ers came to see the demonstrations as a threat to the citys appeal to tourists and investors. Lenders and purchasers have for all intents and purposes blacklisted [ORGANIZATION], said PERSON8, a longtime [ORGANIZATION] real estate developer. Dramatic clashes between protesters and law enforcement provided the opportunity for right-wing politicians and media to depict the city as besieged by violent anarchists and, as [ORGANIZATION] claimed, ablaze all the time. Commenters linked [ORGANIZATION]s protest movement to homelessness and rising gun violence, marshaling it all as evidence of a city in precipitous decline.5 Now, with civic leaders focused on economic recovery, advocates are concerned that efforts to rehabilitate [ORGANIZATION]s brand may eclipse the tentative steps taken toward reform. The pandemic, the protests, and a series of climate-related crises exposed major fault lines in [ORGANIZATION], from public safety and racial inequity to gentrification and homelessness. [PERSON], who is regularly accosted when he goes out in public, is facing a recall [ORGANIZATION]. Business leaders have pressed city officials to be more aggressive in their treatment of protesters and in clearing homeless encampments. Gun violence has fueled calls for reinvestment in [ORGANIZATION]s police force and the reinstatement of some of the disbanded units. During DATE14 of the downtown reopening, [ORGANIZATION] agents and members of a new police unit coordinated to provide a high-visibility presence6a potent illustration of how the winds have shifted.6 We really are a tale of two cities, said PERSON11, who has led police reform efforts on [ORGANIZATION]. One is a city that would like to flip a switch and pretend that [PERSON] didnt happenlike, Lets just clean up the graffiti, get the trash up, and move all the houseless people so we can look like everythings back to normal. And then you have another city that understands we have to fundamentally, radically change a lot of our systems.7 Current Issue many [ORGANIZATION] residents, I have fielded a number of questions about how safe the city is from friends living elsewhere. My immediate reaction has been exasperation Even at the height of the protests, when federal agents were firing impact munitions at moms in bike helmets, violence was evident only around the plazas downtown. During DATE16, I sometimes ran along the waterfront and through downtown. The streets were quiet, the stores shutteredbut downtown had felt empty long before PERSON12 was murdered, since the pandemic cleared out the office workers and tourists who make up the bulk of its foot traffic. Yes, there was more graffiti. But I never felt unsafe.8 And yet it wasnt accurate to tell friends that everything in [ORGANIZATION] was fine. Far-right groups had turned the city into a culture war battleground. Activists and some journalists had been brutalized. Business owners were struggling with pandemic restrictions, which were stricter in [PERSON] than in many other states. Shootings were rising, and in DATE17, dozens of people died during an unprecedented heat wave. The fact that some 4,000 people lacked housing became impossible to ignore as the city paused its regular sweeps of homeless [PERSON] and tents became more visible. The weakness of the states mental health care system became starker, too There were few sources of help that residents could call during encounters with people in the midst of a crisis.9 Many of these challenges are not unique to [ORGANIZATION]. But the media attention magnified them and often situated them within a longstanding narrative about local Democratic leadership collapsing into anarchy. This story line took hold during DATE18 of the PERSON13 administration, as far-right groups repeatedly chose [ORGANIZATION] as a staging ground for media spectacles like the PERSON13 Free Speech Rally organized by ORG13, a [ORGANIZATION] group, in DATE19, [DATE]0 after a white supremacist murdered two people8 on [ORGANIZATION]s light rail. Clashes between these far-right activists and local anti-fascists led to obsessive coverage from conservative outlets like ORG2al [ORGANIZATION], which devoted a cover story in [DATE]1 to the left-wing goons and thugs who ostensibly controlled [ORGANIZATION].10 The immense ORG15 demonstrations here in [LOCATION] and PERSON13s decision to send federal forces into the city made [ORGANIZATION] a mainstream media story. Much of the coverage fixated on vandalism committed by the most extreme of [ORGANIZATION]s activists. In an article in ORG16 in [DATE]2, a consultant who lives in a wealthy suburb likened [ORGANIZATION] to [ORGANIZATION], contending that violence and vandalism were pushing the city toward death. A local news anchor who also lives outside the city wrote9 that it has become the city of trash and filth. ORG17 columnist PERSON15, who is considering a run for [PERSON] governor, decried10 a lack of law and order in the city.11 In [DATE]3, The [PERSON]ian published the results of a poll of [LOCATION] area residents and their views on downtown [ORGANIZATION]. Destroyed, trashed, riots, and homelessness were some of the words frequently used, according to the main story11. Yet 45 percent of the respondents hadnt been downtown at all since the onset of the pandemic, suggesting that what was driving many of these opinions was not experience but media coverage. I just have no sympathy for people who speak with visceral disgust about the city. Its human people who are really struggling, and you havent even actually seen them, said [PERSON], associate professor of urban studies at [ORGANIZATION] State University, which is located downtown. Of polls like The [PERSON]ians, PERSON17 said, Youve basically tested your own coverage. Your sensational coverage has caused people to think that its a wasteland and yet has done very little to [STREET] the alleviation of real suffering. Notably, 83 percent of respondents in that poll said they felt safe in their own [ORGANIZATION] media scrutiny led to finger-pointing, and politicians and business leaders found a convenient scapegoat for [ORGANIZATION]s struggles in the relatively small group of activists who continued to protest [DATE]4, often destroying property. In [DATE]5, after several buildings, including a church, the [PERSON] Historical Society, and the home of ORG21, were vandalized and a police union hall was set on fire, [PERSON] called on citizens to take the city back from anarchists who want to burn, they want to bash, they want to intimidate, they want to assault.13 [DATE]6, four city power brokers, including the real estate mogul and philanthropist PERSON18, met with [LOCATION] Attorney PERSON19 at a private club downtown and pressed [ORGANIZATION] to prosecute protest-related crimes more aggressively. [LOCATION]0, who campaigned as a criminal justice reformer and won more than 75 percent of the vote, had declined to file charges for some low-level offenses like disorderly conduct, arguing they take resources from higher-level prosecutions. I dont want to be arrogant and talk on behalf of 2 million people in the [LOCATION] area, [LOCATION]1 told The [PERSON]ian, but I cant imagine anyone not being concerned about how long the protests have gone on.14 There has been genuine debate among Black organizers and community leaders about protest tactics and the extent to which activists with an antiestablishment agenda and a penchant for property destruction undermined a more focused racial justice movement. At the same time, focusing attention on a small group of activists helped elected officials and police leadership avoid questions about their own commitment to addressing the racial injustices that gave rise to the demonstrations in the first [STREET]. Policing has long been a visible expression of inequity in [ORGANIZATION], but its hardly the only one. [PERSON] was founded as a whites-only state, and in [DATE]7 ORG22 members were prevalent in the state legislature. Redlining forced Black residents into neighborhoods in [LOCATION] and North [ORGANIZATION] that were heavily policed and later damaged by urban renewal projects. [ORGANIZATION], white families in [ORGANIZATION] make more than twice13 what Black families do, while the school district suspends and expels Black students four to five times more often than white students. Once you start peeling back the realities, said [LOCATION]2, a vice chair of the [ORGANIZATION] chapter of the ORG23, this has been a state that has been so hostile towards Black people, and there should be anger from a lot of people.15 Means of survival [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION] has become far more visible since the pandemic began. The city has created safe rest villages in response. [LOCATION]8 [LOCATION]3 FROM [LOCATION]4 Efforts to reimagine public safety in [ORGANIZATION] have been made more complicated by an increase in gun-related crimes, a trend that predates the citys modest steps toward police reform. As of [DATE]8, there had been 717 shooting incidents since [DATE]9, leaving more than 50 people dead and putting [ORGANIZATION] alongside dozens of other cities nationwide that have experienced an uptick in gun violence. Records15 obtained by [PERSON] show that Black [ORGANIZATION]ers have been killed and injured in shootings at a rate 12 times that of white residents.16 One of the most alarming shootings occurred in [LOCATION]0 at a collection of food carts downtown, when six people were injured and a teenager named [LOCATION]5 was killed. [TIME], [PERSON] and [LOCATION]6, the chief of police, spoke with reporters by video conference. [LOCATION]1, in explaining his support for modest cuts to the [ORGANIZATION] Police Bureaus budget15 million out of 248.3 [LOCATION] spoke of his duty to evolve as a leader and to fundamentally rethink what safety means in this community. But in [LOCATION]2, he has called for directing more money to the bureau, citing the shootings and complaints about low staffing, high workload, and burnout. I will fight for additional resources for the police bureau, I will fight for more police officers, and I will fight for more tools and whatever other support the police bureau needs to be able to get its job done, he said during the press conference. ORG26 has asked for a 40 to 50 percent staffing increase. The [ORGANIZATION] Police Bureau declined to comment. [PERSON] was not available for an interview.17 Earlier [PERSON], [PERSON] essentially reinstated the disbanded16 Gun Violence Reduction Team, which had stopped Black drivers disproportionately and had shown little evidence of effectiveness, under two new names ORG28, a unit of 21 officers assigned to investigate gun crimes after the fact, and ORG29, a group of 12 tasked with proactive enforcement. [PERSON] has insisted that the ORG30 is different from previous iterations of the gun violence unit because it will work with a community oversight group responsible for analyzing its impact on communities of color. But after a shooting in [DATE]3, [PERSON] sent a text to ORG26 authorizing him to deploy the focused intervention team without the community oversight panel. The text, as reported17 by [PERSON] Public Broadcasting, continued, Do so AS[LOCATION]8. I am prepared to take the political heat internally including resignation. Deploy the team.18 Its insulting in a lot of ways, said [LOCATION]7 of the ORG23, which opposed the new units. Its a mind trip to have this person on the podium saying theyre listening when we have heard so much of the city say, Do not put more money into the cops in that [STREET].19 There is no consensus about whats driving the increase in shootings across the country. Thats partly because the research is in the early stages and data is lacking, said [LOCATION]8, an assistant professor at ORG32. But [LOCATION]9 and other experts suspect that the economic, social, and psychological disruptions caused by Covid-19 are significant factors. We know that the pandemic created changes in all of the social determinants of violence. There were spikes in poverty, unemployment, food insecurity, all of those drivers of stress at the community level, he said. They hit particularly hard in the places and the communities that have been most disinvested from and therefore were more vulnerable to gun violence incidents.20 While downtown [ORGANIZATION] has received most of the recent media attention, its not where most of the shootings are occurring. [ORGANIZATION] is bisected by FAC1, which runs from the mansions and lush trails of [PERSON], skirting ORG33 bookstore and the sleek condo buildings of [PERSON] before hitting [PERSON], where club-goers from the suburbs step around tents and people sleeping in doorways, then across [ORGANIZATION], through the hedges and big houses of FAC2 and out past FAC3 into sprawling East [ORGANIZATION], an area sometimes called the [PERSON]. Here the city flattens into strip malls, car lots, low-cost apartment buildings, and single-story ranch homes sidewalks [PERSON] out and some roads remain unpaved. East [ORGANIZATION] does not have the twee feeling of [ORGANIZATION]ia. Annexed in [LOCATION]4, this area is where many people searching for affordable housing have moved as prices went up in inner neighborhoods like the LOC7 district, where many Black [ORGANIZATION]ers historically lived. East [ORGANIZATION] is far more diverse than most other parts of the city, and it has a high rate of poverty. Its also suffering disproportionately from the shootings.21 Whether more police would help is a matter of fierce debate. PERSON11 and other critics of the bureau argue that it has plenty of resources that ORG34 proved ineffective in the past, with shootings and homicides staying steady or increasing during its operation, according to [PERSON] Public Broadcasting and that resources should instead be directed toward the social and economic drivers of violence, along with trauma-informed interventions led by community members. We have historical underinvestment in Black communities in [ORGANIZATION], and gun violence is the result of it, said PERSON30, a former schoolteacher and the founder of ORG35, a local organization that runs leadership development programs for young Black men.22 [ORGANIZATION] has made some investments in community-based violence prevention programs, including an emergency budget package passed in [DATE]5 that included 4.1 million in grants for groups working with affected communities. But the money was distributed slowly19, and some [ORGANIZATION]ers in those communities say the emphasis is still on the tried-and-failed responses developed by consultants, politicians, and police. How could you talk about reducing gun violence without gun shooters in the room? asked PERSON31, a former gang member who works on violence prevention. Both PERSON32 and PERSON33 serve on the ORG30 oversight panel. He noted that its hard to get funding for interventions that achieve less obvious wins, such as making sure a young person whos just lost a close friend in a shooting gets home by [TIME]. If you want to stop the retaliation, get in there and deal with some of that trauma.23 [LOCATION] change Commissioner [ORGANIZATION] has led the [ORGANIZATION] City Councils efforts to reform the [INSTITUTION]. PERSON34  [ORGANIZATION] to reform the [ORGANIZATION] police go back DATE8. In [LOCATION]5, the [ORGANIZATION] chapter20 of [ORGANIZATION] tried to get a petition on the ballot to put the police bureau under community control. But their signature-gathering effort was interrupted when police shot a man named PERSON35 at the chapters office, an incident that generated significant negative media coverage for the party. The police kept hitting us and hitting us, said [PERSON], the chapters founder. They put the community control thing on to simmer.24 On [LOCATION]6, [PERSON] attends a vigil for a man named PERSON37, one of a number of Black residents killed by police officers who never faced legal consequences. In [LOCATION]7, police pulled PERSON38 over for failing to use a turn signal. When an officer tried to remove him from his car, PERSON38 shot him in the leg. Police fired 23 rounds in return, killing him. PERSON38 had a mental illness, which is a common element in many [ORGANIZATION] police killings. The police bureau has been under the supervision of ORG37 since [LOCATION]8, after federal investigators found a pattern of excessive force against people with mental illness.25 The brutality of the [ORGANIZATION] Police Bureau and its lack of accountability became particularly apparent during the DATE4 protests [LOCATION]9 and their aftermath. The citys police oversight board, the ORG38, received nearly 4,000 complaints22 about police conduct since the beginning of the protests, during which the police documented some 6,000 uses of force, including firing impact munitions and deploying tear gas. In DATE40, ORG37 rebuked officers for using force indiscriminately. The terms agreed to in the [LOCATION]8 settlement required the bureau to conduct an assessment of its handling of the protests. In [DATE]3, ORG37 slammed the bureaus self-assessment as an advocacy piece to justify what ORG39 did, blame shortcomings on other entities and circumstances beyond ORG39s control, and seek additional funds for new equipment, training, and personnel.26 A number of protest-related lawsuits have been filed against the city, including by a nurse who was allegedly tackled while he worked as a medic a resident who was allegedly beaten after going outside to talk to police about tear gas entering his home and by two protesters and the police reform group [LOCATION]1 for the bureaus indiscriminate use of tear gas. So far only a single officer has been indicted in connection with the protests. In DATE17, Officer PERSON39, who was a member of a unit called [LOCATION]2 that had been dispatched to the protests, was charged23 with one count of assault in the fourth degree for hitting a photographer with a baton in DATE41. All of the remaining officers of [LOCATION]2 resigned from the unit in what was widely seen as an act of [ORGANIZATION] treatment of ORG15 demonstrators is often contrasted with its handling of incursions by far-right militias. In [LOCATION], police were notably absent when far-right activists, including members of [LOCATION]3, came to East [ORGANIZATION] for a rally and clashed with antifascists in brawls featuring baseball bats, paintball guns, and chemical spray. Late in DATE16, a man fired several shots downtown he was later arrested24.28 Police here are just not used to being held accountable, frankly, and so it creates a culture of Theyre right and everyone else is wrong. And that shows up in the [STREET] they police the neighborhoods, said [ORGANIZATION]0, chair of [LOCATION]4, which hears appeals of cases of alleged police misconduct. Systems of oversight are weak, particularly compared with the power wielded by the [ORGANIZATION] Police Association, the union that represents officers of the police bureau. The [LOCATION]6, for instance, has no subpoena power. Six members of the [LOCATION]6 have resigned since DATE43, several citing [PERSON]s lack of support.29 The new oversight board could correct some of this imbalance. It will be the most powerful citizen-run police accountability panel in the country25, with subpoena and firing power. Implementing it will take DATE44 a commission has recently begun work to hash out the boards structure. We get one chance to do it right, said Commissioner [PERSON] protest? Groups of far-right activists, including [LOCATION]3, pictured here, regularly descended on [ORGANIZATION] to clash with antifascists. [LOCATION]8  [ORGANIZATION]1 [ORGANIZATION] police officers have killed two people so far [PERSON], both of whom were in a mental health crisis. Grand juries declined to file charges against the officers in both cases. These kinds of incidents are what motivated the creation of [ORGANIZATION] [STREET] Response26 [TIME], which rolled out its pilot program in DATE40 in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood, an underserved area with a high volume of [LOCATION]9 and nuisance calls. The team consists of a firefighter [ORGANIZATION], a licensed mental-health-crisis therapist, and two community health workers who are embedded in the [INSTITUTION]. The goal is to create an alternative emergency response for incidents involving mental health crises or homelessness, which currently consume a sizable chunk of police resources. Half of the arrests made by [ORGANIZATION] police in DATE19 were of people experiencing homelessness. [PERSON] has notoriously poor mental health care services, ranking 48th in prevalence of mental illness and access to care, according to one study.31 But the pilots scope is limited. Currently [TIME] operates only in [ORGANIZATION], and the team is permitted to independently handle only incidents that do not involve a suicide risk or a weapon and that occur in publicly accessible spaces such as stores or lobbies. Because of these limitations, call volume has been lower than expected. In [DATE]3, three of the citys five commissioners voted against27 PERSON11s proposal to allocate 3.6 million to expand the program into other neighborhoods DATE45. [PERSON] said he supported the pilot but wanted to see outcomes before expanding it more recently, he said he was working with PERSON11 on an expansion. In DATE17, [TIME] asked the city for permission to respond to calls from private spaces such as homes, hotels, and shelters. The [ORGANIZATION] Police Association, which has bargaining rights over [TIME] expansions, denied the request.32 The pilot is one of the few concrete steps [ORGANIZATION] has taken to reimagine public safety since [ORGANIZATION]s death, though it was in the works DATE46. That, combined with the ongoing political wrangling, has put a tremendous amount of pressure on the programs small team of first responders. Its been really, really stressful, said [ORGANIZATION]3, the teams crisis therapist. I love the work. I love what were doing when were out meeting with people. But then on top of that you have all this chatter and media scrutiny. While the program is often described in the media as an opposing force to the police, its staff works closely with the bureau, and many of the emergency dispatchers who assign calls to [TIME] are members of the union. [ORGANIZATION]4, a program manager, described this collaboration as helpful. Given the unions veto power, it is also a necessity. Now that the team has been blocked from independently responding to homes and other private spaces, for instance, [TIME] can maintain its limited mission, or try to co-respond more frequently with [ORGANIZATION] of chief drivers of the backlash against police reform is concern about homelessness and related public safety issues, a debate that [ORGANIZATION] [STREET] Response is also wrapped up in. Some who request the teams services want it to clear homeless encampments, which is not part of its mission. There tends to be these two communities, said [ORGANIZATION]5. One community wants this alternative to police response, and another community, largely people who live in residences near homeless camps, wants more of an enforcement.34 [ORGANIZATION] is one of [ORGANIZATION]s most divisive, complex issues. Its often chalked up to the city offering generous services to houseless individuals. However, research indicates that housing unaffordability is a more significant driver of homelessness. [DATE] and DATE19, rents in [ORGANIZATION] rose faster than income, while home prices jumped28 citywide by over 88,000 between [LOCATION]8 and [DATE]. [ORGANIZATION], 46 percent of renters in the greater [ORGANIZATION] region spend more than 30 percent of their income on rent.35 According to city officials, there were about six large encampments in [ORGANIZATION] before the pandemic as of DATE17, they numbered more than 100. Tents and other structures dot sidewalks, green spaces, and the shoulders of exit ramps throughout the city. During DATE49, [ORGANIZATION] was receiving a record 1,700 complaints about encampments [PERSON]0, according to [LOCATION]. People typically assume because homelessness is more visible, rates of homelessness have gone up, said [ORGANIZATION]6, research director at [ORGANIZATION] State Universitys [ORGANIZATION] Research amp38 [PERSON]. Such a rise may be looming as eviction moratoriums end, [ORGANIZATION]7 noted, but the visibility of the thousands of people living without housing mostly reflects the fact that [ORGANIZATION] paused what had amounted to dozens of [ORGANIZATION] sweeps of encampments after the [ORGANIZATION]6 recommended that people be allowed to shelter in [STREET].36 [ORGANIZATION] has resumed some sweeps, which the city calls clean-ups. Some residents feel that removals arent happening fast enough, while others argue that they are an inhumane measure that prioritizes aesthetics over the well-being of unhoused people, who often lose their belongings in the process. Sweeps are not an approach that has been shown to effectively address the issue that were facing in terms of housing shortages, [ORGANIZATION]7 said. All it is is moving people along.37 Some other new initiatives offer medium- and long-term solutions. County and city officials have united around a plan to create six safe rest villages, designated parking or camping sites that will offer hygiene services and case management. These may provide some immediate safe shelter, but they dont solve the underlying issue of housing affordability. [LOCATION]1, voters approved a quarter-billion-dollar measure30 to fund permanent supportive housing, and [ORGANIZATION] enacted a significant zoning reform that will permit multi-unit homes in residential lots, a plan that housing experts believe may eventually help lower housing costs across the city.38 [ORGANIZATION]s racial justice protests were driven by the fraught history of racism and policing in the city and its deeply rooted tradition of radical activism. But they also emerged in the context of [ORGANIZATION]s recent transformation from an under-the-radar, affordable city into a national tourist and business destination with snarls of traffic and block-long lines for famous ice cream, where the cost of rent was for a time rising faster than almost anywhere else in the country. This transformation is neatly expressed in the new [ORGANIZATION] under construction downtown. Its lower facade is now in [STREET], a skeleton of pale, asymmetric blocks stacked like bones. Invitations sent out recently to potential investors described the tower as a response to the rapid proliferation of commerce and affluence in [ORGANIZATION].39 Ultimately, the protests became a lightning rod for more expansive anxieties about the trajectory of the city and who wields power here. Before the pandemic, the city government was taking tentative steps to address equity in its planning decisions and to stop the displacement of vulnerable residents in gentrifying neighborhoods. [PERSON], of [ORGANIZATION] State, believes that some of the backlash from the business community to the protests is really a very explicit rebuke of the idea of placing equitable development at the core of decision-making.40 The conversation about the citys major issues is, in my view, reprehensibly putting the blame on poor people, Black people, and allies of Black civil rights for essentially every ill thats happening in the city right now, PERSON17 continued. The result is a narrative that insists the only [STREET] we can save us is more cops get out of the [STREET] of my development juice at the top so high-income tourists come back. To acknowledge that [ORGANIZATION]s greatest challenges have little to do with anarchists would mean having a more difficult conversation about the citys future.

[ORGANIZATION] executives are also continuing to scout new locations nationwide to open additional hemp processing centers in legal markets. For a more complete description on the ORG37 as mentioned above, read the following [ORGANIZATION] press release, [ORGANIZATION] Announces Strategic ORG31 Growing Partner ORG37 [PERSON], Inc. Completes Final Site Plan Blueprints, below [ORGANIZATION] has announced that its strategic growing partner, ORG37 [PERSON], Inc., has completed its final site plan blueprints for its 500-acre site in [LOCATION], [PERSON] 20 miles north of [ORGANIZATION]0, [ORGANIZATION]1 and [TIME] from [ORGANIZATION]2, [ORGANIZATION]3. The site plan was submitted to [ORGANIZATION]0 for final review. The [ORGANIZATION] is also in the final stages of completing the necessary infrastructure to support an off-grid, renewable, energy system. With the solar equipment in [STREET], the sites solar power operation will be completed in [LOCATION]. As soon as the live streaming video cameras are up and operational, the world can actually see the [STREET] the ORG37 is designed and watch it being built. According to [ORGANIZATION], the basic framework or overall plan of [ORGANIZATION] is to create a holistic healing and learning center that is designed to educate and heal veterans with PTSD, alcoholism, [ORGANIZATION], opioid addiction, and other psychological conditions while at the same time training them on the numerous aspects of being part of the emerging multi-billion dollar hemp industry. We will also be building hemp-growing communities for other groups such as [ORGANIZATION]2, [ORGANIZATION]3, [ORGANIZATION]4, and [ORGANIZATION]5 the healers are professionals who are knowledgeable in the modalities to treat these traumatized groups. These particular communities are all synergistically aligned to work simultaneously supporting each other. For example, the [ORGANIZATION]6 heal the traumatized veterans and women children the women support orphan children, and orphan children want to see people living in homes and not homeless. Thus, a portion of the hemp grown in each community goes to create and support another community, giving everybody a sense of giving back and helping others as they help themselves. This circles back to the healers who also work to heal the veterans and the other traumatized groups. This is the economic foundation on how the sale of the hemp products operates as a quantum economic matrix or an example of symbiotic economics which is more complex than this brief description allows. [ORGANIZATION], the Project Manager for the ORG37 [PERSON], Inc., said, We are very happy with the progress. Our [ORGANIZATION]8 is really beginning to come together. In anticipation of planting to begin during DATE8, 300 acres have been fenced, 16 overnight trailer park sites are under construction, and six 4040-ft organic vegetable gardens have been planted and are currently producing food and kenaf, according to [ORGANIZATION]9. These organic gardens double as experimental growing modules using an entire array of different growing technologies to see which modalities grow the best in a desert environment. As for the 6 geodesic domes mentioned in an earlier press release, 1 is structurally complete with only the electrical and plumbing to be completed. The rest are on site awaiting final site plan approval. We are now accepting volunteers who have expressed an interest in helping to build the first [ORGANIZATION]8 for our veterans, said [ORGANIZATION]9. Those interested in making the first hemp growing CBD-producing ORG37 become a reality should contact Ms. [PERSON] via email . One thousand trees, on 36 of the 500-acres, have also been planted, with an additional 1,000 trees on order. The ORG37 will include a 100,000-square foot GMP compliant, central processing plant, a state-of-the-art testing laboratory, and various health and wellness centers to support veterans who may have psychological, emotional or health issues. As [ORGANIZATION] positions itself on the forefront of [LOCATION]s industrial hemp revolution, we see our partnership with ORG37 [PERSON], Inc. being paramount in supporting the small family farm movement that we are confident will reshape the [LOCATION]n landscape, said [ORGANIZATION]. As we work toward getting our eco-village up and running in [PERSON], we are also aggressively scouting strategic locations in other states including [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]4, [ORGANIZATION]5, [ORGANIZATION]6, [ORGANIZATION]7, [ORGANIZATION]8 and [ORGANIZATION]9. Giving veterans and other [LOCATION]ns a [STREET] to learn new skills and take part in this multi-billion-dollar hemp CBD market is very exciting. Its a big part of our mission to give back. Recently we have expanded our [ORGANIZATION]8 concept internationally focusing, but not limited to, [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION], GPE23, and GPE24. According to [ORGANIZATION], we hope to have 50 master hemp growers working on their first ORG37 in [PERSON]. To date, we have growers from [ORGANIZATION], GPE25, [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION]7, [ORGANIZATION], GPE27, [ORGANIZATION]5, and [PERSON] who have expressed an interest in pursuing a joint venture with [ORGANIZATION] to each grow industrial hemp on 5 of the 300 fenced acres in [PERSON].

WHAT IS [PERSON]? ORG31 is a durable natural fiber that is grown as a renewable source for raw materials that can be incorporated into thousands of products. Its one of the oldest domesticated crops known to man. ORG31 is used in nutritional food products such as hemp seeds, hemp hearts and hemp proteins, for humans. It is also used in building materials, paper, textiles, cordage, organic body care and other nutraceuticals, just to name a few. It has thousands of other known uses. A hemp crop requires half the water alfalfa uses and can be grown without the heavy use of pesticides. Farmers worldwide grow hemp commercially for fiber, seed, and oil for use in a variety of industrial and consumer products. GPE28 is the only developed nation that fails to cultivate industrial hemp as an economic crop on a large scale, according to [ORGANIZATION]0. However, with rapidly changing laws and more states gravitating towards industrial hemp and passing an industrial hemp bill, that could change. Currently, the majority of hemp sold in GPE29 is imported from [PERSON]0 and [LOCATION], the worlds largest exporters of the industrial hemp crop.

To see the [ORGANIZATION] mill in operation and processing product, visit [ORGANIZATION]s personal Facebook page and scroll down to [PERSON]4. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN [PERSON] AND MARIJUANA ORG31 is completely different from [PERSON] in its function, cultivation and application. In cultivating [PERSON], the plants are spaced far apart, and the male plants are destroyed to assure that they cannot seed the female plants, which would result in undesirable, less potent and less marketable, seeded [PERSON] buds. ORG31, on the other hand, is planted close together and commonly hermaphrodites, which creates an abundance of seeds, the main component of ORG31 foods and supplements. The ORG31 stalks are processed and used for fiber, composite, and other hemp based end products. ORG31 is used in variety of other applications that [PERSON] couldnt possibly be used in. These include healthy dietary supplements, skin products, clothing, and accessories. Overall, hemp is known to have over 25,000 possible applications . ORG31 products such as ORG31 Milk, ORG31 Cereal, and ORG31 Oil are used by consumers [PERSON]5. For an excellent read on the difference between hemp and [PERSON], visit [ORGANIZATION] . 9 GREAT REASONS TO INCLUDE [PERSON] AS PART OF A HEALTHY DIET  Source  Although hemp seeds come from the [ORGANIZATION] sativa plant, they do not produce a mind-altering effect. These small, brown seeds are rich in protein, fiber, and healthful fatty acids, including omega-3s and omega-6s. They have antioxidant effects and may reduce symptoms of numerous ailments, improving the health of the heart, skin, and joints. Read all the reasons to include hemp as part of a healthy diet here . HOW [PERSON] CAN CHANGE THE WORLD Fiber - ORG31 fiber can be used to make fabrics and textiles, rope and paper. The word canvas actually derives from the word cannabis. Fuel - While the industrial, medicinal and commercial properties of hemp have been known to mankind for a very long time, its benefits to the environment have just been realized in [PERSON]6. One of the compelling things hemp offers is fuel. With reserves of petroleum being depleted, it would be nice if we could have a fuel source which was reusable and which we could grow right here, making us completely energy independent. Food - ORG31 seeds are very nutritious and were first thought to be eaten by [ORGANIZATION] and Indians. ORG31 seeds have a nutty taste and can be eaten raw, ground up, sprouted, or made into dried sprout powder. ORG31 seeds also contain a very beneficial oil that is high in unsaturated fatty acids, including an optimal 14 ratio of omega-3 to 6. Building Material - ORG31 can be made into a variety of building materials. These include concrete-like blocks called hempcrete, biodegradable plastics, and wood replacements. These materials have been used in the manufacture of many things, including electronics, cars and houses. In fact, the first [LOCATION]n home made of hemp-based materials was completed in [PERSON]7 in [PERSON]1, [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION], the oil from hemp seeds and stalks can also be made into biofuels such as [ORGANIZATION] known as hempoline. While this biofuel can be used to power engines, it does take quite a lot of raw material to produce a substantial amount.

That means more events and conferences, thus, [ORGANIZATION] has started compiling an ongoing list of upcoming hemp events around the world. Check out the listing of international and domestic events here . [PERSON]4S TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE With a deep-rooted social and environmental mission at its core, [ORGANIZATION] seeks to build a business constituency for the [LOCATION]n small farmer, the [LOCATION]n veteran, and other groups experiencing the ever-increasing disparity between tapering income and soaring expenses.

ORG45 The companys 500-acre strategic growing partner [PERSON] in [LOCATION], [PERSON], is also designed to grow hemp and produce CBD products to benefit veterans as well as generate revenue for [ORGANIZATION]1G0, [ORGANIZATION] and individual veterans living in the community. [ORGANIZATION]1G0 executives are also continuing to scout new locations nationwide to open additional hemp processing centers in legal markets. For a more complete description on the [PERSON] as mentioned above, read the following [ORGANIZATION]9 press release, [ORGANIZATION]1G0 Announces Strategic [LOCATION] Growing Partner [PERSON] [PERSON], Inc. Completes Final Site Plan Blueprints, below [ORGANIZATION]1G0 has announced that its strategic growing partner, [PERSON] [PERSON], Inc., has completed its final site plan blueprints for its 500-acre site in [LOCATION], [PERSON] 20 miles north of [ORGANIZATION]5, [ORGANIZATION]6 and [TIME] from [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]7. The site plan was submitted to ORG49 for final review. The [ORGANIZATION] is also in the final stages of completing the necessary infrastructure to support an off-grid, renewable, energy system. With the solar equipment in [STREET], the sites solar power operation will be completed in the next [ORGANIZATION]2. As soon as the live streaming video cameras are up and operational, the world can actually see the [STREET] the [PERSON] is designed and watch it being built. According to [PERSON], the basic framework or overall plan of [ORGANIZATION] Kins Communities is to create a holistic healing and learning center that is designed to educate and heal veterans with PTSD, alcoholism, [ORGANIZATION], opioid addiction, and other psychological conditions while at the same time training them on the numerous aspects of being part of the emerging multi-billion dollar hemp industry. We will also be building hemp-growing communities for other groups such as ORG51 [ORGANIZATION], ORG52, [ORGANIZATION], and [DATE] the healers are professionals who are knowledgeable in the modalities to treat these traumatized groups. These particular communities are all synergistically aligned to work simultaneously supporting each other. For example, the ORG55 heal the traumatized veterans and women children the women support orphan children, and orphan children want to see people living in homes and not homeless. Thus, a portion of the hemp grown in each community goes to create and support another community, giving everybody a sense of giving back and helping others as they help themselves. This circles back to the healers who also work to heal the veterans and the other traumatized groups. This is the economic foundation on how the sale of the hemp products operates as a quantum economic matrix or an example of symbiotic economics which is more complex than this brief description allows. [PERSON], the Project Manager for the [PERSON] [PERSON], Inc., said, We are very happy with the progress. Our ORG57 is really beginning to come together. In anticipation of planting to begin during [DATE]1, 300 acres have been fenced, 16 overnight trailer park sites are under construction, and six 4040-ft organic vegetable gardens have been planted and are currently producing food and kenaf, according to ORG58. These organic gardens double as experimental growing modules using an entire array of different growing technologies to see which modalities grow the best in a desert environment. As for the 6 geodesic domes mentioned in an earlier press release, 1 is structurally complete with only the electrical and plumbing to be completed. The rest are on site awaiting final site plan approval. We are now accepting volunteers who have expressed an interest in helping to build the first ORG57 for our veterans, said ORG58. Those interested in making the first hemp growing CBD-producing [PERSON] become a reality should contact Ms. [PERSON]0 via email . One thousand trees, on 36 of the 500-acres, have also been planted, with an additional 1,000 trees on order. The [PERSON] will include a 100,000-square foot GMP compliant, central processing plant, a state-of-the-art testing laboratory, and various health and wellness centers to support veterans who may have psychological, emotional or health issues. As [ORGANIZATION]1G0 positions itself on the forefront of [ORGANIZATION]3s industrial hemp revolution, we see our partnership with [PERSON] [PERSON], Inc. being paramount in supporting the small family farm movement that we are confident will reshape the [ORGANIZATION]3n landscape, said [PERSON]. As we work toward getting our eco-village up and running in [PERSON], we are also aggressively scouting strategic locations in other states including [ORGANIZATION]2, [ORGANIZATION]8, [ORGANIZATION]9, [ORGANIZATION]0, [ORGANIZATION]1, [ORGANIZATION]2 and [ORGANIZATION]3. Giving veterans and other [ORGANIZATION]3ns a [STREET] to learn new skills and take part in this multi-billion-dollar hemp CBD market is very exciting. Its a big part of our mission to give back. Recently we have expanded our ORG57 concept internationally focusing, but not limited to, [ORGANIZATION]4, [ORGANIZATION]5, [ORGANIZATION]6, [ORGANIZATION]7, and [ORGANIZATION]8. According to [PERSON], we hope to have 50 master hemp growers working on their first [PERSON] in [PERSON]. To date, we have growers from [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION]9, [LOCATION]0, [ORGANIZATION]1, [ORGANIZATION]2, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]9, and [PERSON] who have expressed an interest in pursuing a joint venture with [ORGANIZATION]1G0 to each grow industrial hemp on 5 of the 300 fenced acres in [PERSON].

WHAT IS [PERSON]? [LOCATION] is a durable natural fiber that is grown as a renewable source for raw materials that can be incorporated into thousands of products. Its one of the oldest domesticated crops known to man. [LOCATION] is used in nutritional food products such as hemp seeds, hemp hearts and hemp proteins, for humans. It is also used in building materials, paper, textiles, cordage, organic body care and other nutraceuticals, just to name a few. It has thousands of other known uses. A hemp crop requires half the water alfalfa uses and can be grown without the heavy use of pesticides. Farmers worldwide grow hemp commercially for fiber, seed, and oil for use in a variety of industrial and consumer products. [LOCATION]1 is the only developed nation that fails to cultivate industrial hemp as an economic crop on a large scale, according to ORG60. However, with rapidly changing laws and more states gravitating towards industrial hemp and passing an industrial hemp bill, that could change. Currently, the majority of hemp sold in [ORGANIZATION] is imported from [LOCATION]2 and [ORGANIZATION]6, the worlds largest exporters of the industrial hemp crop.

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN [PERSON] AND MARIJUANA [LOCATION] is completely different from [PERSON] in its function, cultivation and application. In cultivating [PERSON], the plants are spaced far apart, and the male plants are destroyed to assure that they cannot seed the female plants, which would result in undesirable, less potent and less marketable, seeded [PERSON] buds. [LOCATION], on the other hand, is planted close together and commonly hermaphrodites, which creates an abundance of seeds, the main component of [LOCATION] foods and supplements. The [LOCATION] stalks are processed and used for fiber, composite, and other hemp based end products. [LOCATION] is used in variety of other applications that [PERSON] couldnt possibly be used in. These include healthy dietary supplements, skin products, clothing, and accessories. Overall, hemp is known to have over 25,000 possible applications . [LOCATION] products such as [LOCATION] Milk, [LOCATION] Cereal, and [LOCATION] Oil are used by consumers [DATE]8. For an excellent read on the difference between hemp and [PERSON], visit the Ministry of [LOCATION] . 9 GREAT REASONS TO INCLUDE [PERSON] AS PART OF A HEALTHY DIET  Source  Although hemp seeds come from the [ORGANIZATION] sativa plant, they do not produce a mind-altering effect. These small, brown seeds are rich in protein, fiber, and healthful fatty acids, including omega-3s and omega-6s. They have antioxidant effects and may reduce symptoms of numerous ailments, improving the health of the heart, skin, and joints. Read all the reasons to include hemp as part of a healthy diet here . HOW [PERSON] CAN CHANGE THE W[ORGANIZATION]1LD Fiber - [LOCATION] fiber can be used to make fabrics and textiles, rope and paper. The word canvas actually derives from the word cannabis. Fuel - While the industrial, medicinal and commercial properties of hemp have been known to mankind for a very long time, its benefits to the environment have just been realized in recent [PERSON]. One of the compelling things hemp offers is fuel. With reserves of petroleum being depleted, it would be nice if we could have a fuel source which was reusable and which we could grow right here, making us completely energy independent. Food - [LOCATION] seeds are very nutritious and were first thought to be eaten by [ORGANIZATION] and Indians. [LOCATION] seeds have a nutty taste and can be eaten raw, ground up, sprouted, or made into dried sprout powder. [LOCATION] seeds also contain a very beneficial oil that is high in unsaturated fatty acids, including an optimal 14 ratio of omega-3 to 6. Building Material - [LOCATION] can be made into a variety of building materials. These include concrete-like blocks called hempcrete, biodegradable plastics, and wood replacements. These materials have been used in the manufacture of many things, including electronics, cars and houses. In fact, the first [ORGANIZATION]3n home made of hemp-based materials was completed in [ORGANIZATION]0 in [LOCATION]3, [ORGANIZATION]2. [ORGANIZATION], the oil from hemp seeds and stalks can also be made into biofuels such as [ORGANIZATION] known as hempoline. While this biofuel can be used to power engines, it does take quite a lot of raw material to produce a substantial amount.

[PERSON] BOTTOM LINE With a deep-rooted social and environmental mission at its core, [ORGANIZATION]1G0 seeks to build a business constituency for the [ORGANIZATION]3n small farmer, the [ORGANIZATION]3n veteran, and other groups experiencing the ever-increasing disparity between tapering income and soaring expenses.

Dems Entitlement Mentality Extends to Governing!125 The very briefest history of communism is this It always fails, regardless of who tries it, regardless of where it is tried, and regardless of how it is tried. Every communist failure has been a human catastrophe. This happens because in the heart of communism lives a flawed view of what makes us human. Whether it was [PERSON], the former U[ORGANIZATION]Rs Siberian prison camps, or ORG58 Chinese communist reeducation camps, the underlying premise is the same. The minds of men and women are infinitely malleable and thus can be twisted into whatever grotesque shape the communist leadership determines is most beneficial for the new society. Oddly enough, what is most beneficial for this new communist nation is that the new communist leadership  having toppled the old democratic leadership  continue to govern forever. In practice it never works out that [STREET], because the central communist truth about humanity is false. Men and women are not infinitely malleable in what they believe and therefore in how they act. Coercion and violence may keep them in line for [ORGANIZATION]3, but in the midst of building their impossible utopia, the glorious revolution always drowns the nation in blood.

In response, [ORGANIZATION] Mayor [PERSON], Secretary [PERSON], if you dont think govt can provide solutions, then you should step aside and allow someone up to the task to lead. Apparently, in GPE3 it is an apostasy to think that any problem cant be solved by throwing tax dollars at it. This is particularly ironic when [PERSON] is now suffering cost overruns3 on its so-called affordable housing projects comparable to those for its light-rail projects."
portland,2017-12-11T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,The Oregonian,"homelessness, affordable housing",Throwing Money at Housing Won't Work,"One project that was supposed to cost 200,000 per unit is coming in at 285,000 per unit-a 42.5 percent overrun. [ORGANIZATION] proudly tweeted that the city just approved another project with 203 units of so-called affordable housing. Because home prices in a market of nearly 820,000 homes are going to be significantly influenced by the subsidized construction of 203 more-Not! As the [ORGANIZATION] previously [ORGANIZATION], affordable housing is not the same as housing affordability. Affordable housing is government subsidized housing for people too poor to afford housing. It is not intended or expected to influence the overall housing market because it does nothing about the underlying conditions that have made housing expensive in the first [STREET]. The problem in [ORGANIZATION], and the entire [ORGANIZATION], is that housing is unaffordable to almost everyone, not just the very poor, and the only real solution for most people is to move away. The rent steals so much of your paycheck, you might have to move back in with your parents, reflects5 ORG1, and half your life is spent staring at the rear end of the car in front of you. This, in a nutshell, describes the [ORGANIZATION]s two biggest complaints about [ORGANIZATION]-style urban planning that it deliberately makes housing expensive and roads congested. Of course, the ORG2 never mentions the cause, only the results [ORGANIZATION]ns are fleeing the state for more affordable and less congested places such as [PERSON]. [ORGANIZATION] is nearly 95 percent rural, but the remaining 5.3 percent consists of the densest urban lands of any state in the country. This is no accident, but a result of [ORGANIZATION] of careful planning by urban planners who believe that low-density development is bad and high densities-the higher the better-are good. On average, [ORGANIZATION] urban areas have more than 4,300 people per square mile, compared with less than 2,200 for urban areas in the other 49 states. [ORGANIZATION] also has the least affordable housing in the country. The solution, [ORGANIZATION] ORG2, is denser development. Come again? If being twice as dense as everyone else has given [ORGANIZATION] the nations least affordable housing, how can more density make it more affordable? [PERSON] has been subject to this density mania for [LOCATION]. [ORGANIZATION]s [LOCATION] just did a story about six cities7 that are supposedly smarter than [ORGANIZATION] about housing. Were they smarter by not having urban-growth boundaries? No, in most cases they were smarter, according to the newspaper, because they allowed more density. [LOCATION] doesnt cite any evidence that this made them more affordable, and in fact the densest ones are pretty unaffordable. [PERSON], supposedly, is smarter because it encourages row houses-a form of housing that [ORGANIZATION] according to an DATE2 article in the [PERSON]ian that is no longer on line rejected [LOCATION] ago because it wasnt dense enough. According to the latest affordability data8, [PERSON] is much less affordable than [ORGANIZATION], so it is hardly a shining example. Similarly, [ORGANIZATION] is supposed to be smarter because it allows taller high rises than [ORGANIZATION], which limits buildings to 460 feet. But if [ORGANIZATION]s housing shortage was due to high-rise regulations, you would at least see lots of residential high rises that are close to but not over [ORGANIZATION]s height limit. You dont. GPE7, [PERSON] and GPE9 all have buildings in the works that will rise higher than 1,000 feet, says the [DATE]. And those cities are how much more affordable than [ORGANIZATION]? No, they are less affordable. [PERSON]0 cut red tape on new construction. While thats a good idea, the latest density data indicate that [PERSON]0s urban densities are declining, probably because people are moving out due to high housing costs. [PERSON]1 is supposed to be smarter because it is spending gobs of money building high-density public housing. But when you are in a multi-trillion-dollar housing market, it is going to take hundreds of billions of dollars in public housing to have an effect on prices. PERSON1 is absolutely right throwing other peoples money at the problem may be politically popular, but it doesnt solve anything. While homelessness isnt exclusively related to affordability, its no coincidence that homelessness is rising fastest9 in unaffordable areas. If cities and states would make themselves more affordable by relaxing rural land-use restrictions, the need for public housing would dramatically decline. The affordable-housing crunch is a nationwide problem, claims the above-mentioned [LOCATION] ORG2 article. Wrong again its only a problem in states that have rural land-use restrictions, which are basically the LOC2 states, [PERSON] to northern [PERSON]2, and [PERSON]3. This means the solutions are very different than they would be if it were truly a national problem. Density is not the solution because land in dense areas and construction of mid-rise and high-rise housing costs more than low-rise construction in low-density areas. Those who argue for density have fallen into the trap set by urban planners of failing to look beyond urban boundaries. [PERSON] is 98.5 percent rural. [ORGANIZATION] is 94.7 percent rural. The solution to the housing affordability issue in these states is to allow development on those rural lands. That means governments real job is to out of the [STREET], not create more costly programs that dont work. If [ORGANIZATION] doesnt understand this, then maybe he should be the one to step aside.  1  2 incart_river_index  3  4  5  6  7  8  9"

portland,2017-12-04T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,The Oregonian,homeless,Protesters swarmed a [ORGANIZATION] store after its CEO said the company may close its office due to safety concerns,"DATE0 PERSON0 Delivered by [ORGANIZATION] WikiMediaM.O. PERSON1 On [LOCATION], protests erupted outside the ORG1 store in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], forcing it to close. The protesters were responding to an open letter that CEO PERSON2 had written about safety concerns around the companys office. Some saw it as an attack on the neighborhoods homeless population. Protesters are not happy with ORG1s weighing in on [ORGANIZATION]s social ills. Roughly 50 people descended on the brands flagship location in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], on [LOCATION], forcing the store to close, according to The [PERSON]ian.1 The protest was in response to an editorial2 that PERSON2, the companys CEO and president, published in The [PERSON]ian in [DATE]."
portland,2017-12-04T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,The Oregonian,"homeless, homelessness",Protesters swarmed a [ORGANIZATION] store after its CEO said the company may close its office due to safety concerns,"The letter announced that the company would consider moving its [ORGANIZATION] office in downtown [ORGANIZATION], which is used by its [ORGANIZATION] brand. [ORGANIZATION] said he would make the decision in [LOCATION]. Safety concerns have arisen as some employees said they received death threats from nearby panhandlers. [ORGANIZATION], one of our employees had to run into traffic when a stranger outside our office followed her and threatened to kill her. On other occasions our employees have arrived at work only to be menaced by individuals camping in the doorway, the letter read. Our employees have had so many car break-ins downtown that we have started referring to parking in [ORGANIZATION] as our laptop donation program. The letter went on to call for more to be done to make [ORGANIZATION]s downtown area safer, including a greater police presence and more attention to the issue from city government. The editorial received a swift response from [ORGANIZATION]s civic leadership. Signs around downtown now say that loitering is prohibited, and that the sidewalk is for pedestrian movement only  a reference to [ORGANIZATION]s no-sit policy, according to ORG1. Though the letter itself did not mention homelessness at all, some in the [ORGANIZATION] community interpreted the signs and the letter as an attack on an already-vulnerable population. We think its disgusting that a CEO that happened to give so much money to Mayor [PERSON] campaign can write an op-ed and instantly these signs go up that no one is allowed to sit in front of his business, [ORGANIZATION], the founder of [ORGANIZATION]s Resistance, the group that organized the protest, told [ORGANIZATION] affiliate [PERSON]. We shouldnt be criminalizing things homeless people need to do to survive. Protesters held signs with slogans like [PERSON] is a last resort, not a crime and Making hardship harder wont make it go away. In a statement released on [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] said Its irresponsible to conflate homelessness and crime. We can address safety issues with common sense enforcement. We can address homelessness with compassion. Thats our plan. The store reopened on [PERSON], but the protesters say they may be back. In response to the protests, ORG6 released a statement from [ORGANIZATION] DATE5, [ORGANIZATION] delivered a truckload of coats to ORG8, an important nonprofit that assists homeless individuals in [ORGANIZATION], and our team participated in TV interviews stressing the importance of providing support for communities in need. [ORGANIZATION], I published an opinion piece in ORG1 urging city leaders to address urgent safety issues in downtown [ORGANIZATION] in part by providing resources for community policing. My opinion piece in ORG1 did not address homelessness generally. The word does not appear in the article, because the concerns about safety are not tied solely to that issue. The call for community policing resources got far more attention, but the spotlight needs to be much broader. You would be hard-pressed to name all the agencies and enterprises who are involved in some [STREET] in these inter-related issues. There are issues that touch the state, the city, the county, and there are no doubt resources being spent by public bodies that no one thinks of in connection with homelessness. At times [ORGANIZATION]ers seem to be talking past each other, choosing one side or another to what is inherently a multi-sided issue. We can and should - and We do - show compassion to support individuals in need. At the same time, we can and should provide resources for law enforcement to provide greater safety for all. While this a challenging situation, I refuse to give up, and I would encourage all Oregonians to devote time, attention, and, yes, resources to address the complex issues surrounding homelessness. In meetings with local and state leaders in [LOCATION] I have offered to contribute personally to genuine solutions  not policing  and I have reiterated my belief that others in the business community should join this effort. I am glad to call business leaders personally to ask them to contribute. We cannot solve all problems, and we will likely never address all the needs related to homelessness, but as Oregonians we can make meaningful progress if our leaders business, government, nonprofits and others have the will to do so.

[DATE] [LOCATION] [PHONE][ZIP][ORGANIZATION][PHONE][PHONE][ORGANIZATION]548 [DATE] [DATE] 55 [LOCATION]75[ORGANIZATION]558 [DATE] A Tragedy Unfolding This is [ORGANIZATION], Central [ORGANIZATION]s Are Trapped84 According to [ORGANIZATION], the founder and the lead market strategist for [ORGANIZATION], this regulation of the economy by the central banks is all going to end badly. The fact of the matter is simple central banks are hopelessly trapped. [PERSON] says that its only a matter of time before investors learn the hard [STREET] that this sudden capitulation by central bankers is not a positive sign, but rather a sign of desperation. In a recent article he wrote for his website ORG2, [PERSON] says this economic manipulation by the central banks is all going to end badly. Even some ardent bulls will freely admit this, the question is the how, when and the where. Frankly, its a tragedy thats unfolding and discerning eyes can see it. Since the [ORGANIZATION] lows markets have taken the scripted route higher salivating at the prospect of dovish central bankers once again levitating asset prices higher, [PERSON] wrote. He also tweeted that this is all a shell game in which central banks are trapped.85 Globalists Are Bringing Their One World Currency Plans Out Into the Open86 People often ask me when they should begin to worry about the agenda for the global economic reset and the controlled demolition of the economy? If economic collapse is a process rather than an event, at what point in the process will we start to feel direct consequences? While crash conditions in economic fundamentals have indeed already started in [LOCATION], culminating in faltering housing and retail numbers as well as an inverted yield curve, the average person is only affected so far in a minor [STREET]. Its true  even during the greatest of financial depressions, only a part of the population suffers while the rest live somewhat normally. This relativity in crisis changes, though, when we start talking about a currency collapse. In the event that the primary mechanism for exchange becomes unstable, as in DATE2 [ORGANIZATION] in the [ORGANIZATION] or in [PERSON] in [DATE], the damage to the public is almost universal except for the elitist class. In the midst of stagflationary headwinds, many people could still live a comfortable life given they are willing to make some sacrifices. But, in the midst of a currency implosion, anyone who is ill prepared will have to face the pain. As far as timing is concerned, we can make educated guesses according to the evidence, but there is no exact science to predicting when the globalists will pull the plug completely on economic life support. They will trigger a disaster when the timing most suits them. However, I do believe there are signals to watch for. In the past I have said that when globalist criminals stop trying to hide their criminality  when they start to become brazen in their rhetoric and agenda, that is when it is time for people to worry. Why? Because when criminals act more confident it is usually because they think they have already gotten away with it. Their plans are almost complete. Over [PERSON], the globalists have become absolutely brazen in flaunting their endgame for a single global currency system. Yes, it is time to be concerned. But there are people out there who will tell you that the notion is far fetched. They will tell you that it is doom porn, and they will tell you it is conspiracy theory. The evidence says otherwise. The evidence says it is conspiracy FACT But before global governance can be instilled as a necessity in the public psyche and the banking elites establiPERSON3 as the benevolent rulers of the planet, several things must be accompliPERSON3. One of the first steps to global government would be global economic management and a single world currency. After this is achieved, global government would become much easier to sell to the public. Beyond this, the idea that the globalists have total control already is nonsense. The big secret the establishment does not want you to know about is that elitist power hangs by a thin thread, and that thread is public inaction and distraction. The establishment spends trillions of dollars and thousands of man-hours developing propaganda and launching wars in order to keep the populace preoccupied exactly because their control is an illusion. All it would take is for a marginal percentage of people to wake up [DATE] and suddenly decide to grab their torches and pitchforks or maybe sniper rifles in a modern hypothetical scenario and start snuffing out the tiny faction of elites in highest positions. Their control would vanish, and they would be hiding in the deepest holes they could find. Sure, others could take their [STREET], but why would they want to when making the attempt would be a potential death sentence?

A quick look at the website of a company called [ORGANIZATION] may convince you that its true. It appears they own the entire blockchain and cryptocurrency space. ORG6 is, according to its own website, The epicenter of the bitcoin and blockchain industry. Former ORG[ORGANIZATION]5 Secretary and [ORGANIZATION] insider [PERSON] is an advisor to the ORG6 board, whose members include PERSON[ORGANIZATION]5, PERSON8, and PERSON9. [PERSON]0 is a former ORG9 insider, who co-developed the companys first transactional interactive multimedia software kiosk products. He once served as chairman of the [ORGANIZATION]0 [ORGANIZATION]1 Devil Venture Fund. He is also on the boards of [ORGANIZATION]2 and [ORGANIZATION]3. [ORGANIZATION]2 is a software provider of human-aware artificial intelligence that understands the [ORGANIZATION] body shape and motion of people from [ORGANIZATION] photos or videos. [PERSON]0 provided start-up capital for [ORGANIZATION]2 from his [ORGANIZATION]4 fund, which he started after his stint at ORG9. Their focus is [ORGANIZATION] and [LOCATION]. [ORGANIZATION]2 was purchased by [ORGANIZATION]5 in [LOCATION] and will play a key role in the development of 5G smart surveillance cameras.

[PERSON] Over the [ORGANIZATION], And the [ORGANIZATION]9 is Warning Flooding Could Extend Into [LOCATION]2 We arent supposed to have a major blizzard in [LOCATION]3. [LOCATION]4 after a bomb cyclone caused apocalyptic flooding in the central part of the country, another bomb cyclone is hitting the exact same area. One meteorologist has called it a life-threatening storm, and at this moment over four million people are under blizzard warnings. [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON] and GPE6 are going to get absolutely hammered before the storm finally moves east on [LOCATION]5. The authorities are warning that this new bomb cyclone will cause additional flooding in the region, but at this point we do not know how bad that flooding will be. The good news is that the ground has been softened up by warmer weather since the last bomb cyclone, and that should mean that more of the moisture is absorbed before it flows into the major rivers. But the bad news is that we are being told that this storm could break records. The following comes from ORG20 A [PERSON]9-[PERSON][ORGANIZATION]5 Bromance?96 Conservatives takeover of ORG21 stalled by [PERSON]4 bromance. Thats the headline of a story in [LOCATION]. The author explains Chief Justice [PERSON]5 and the courts newest member, [PERSON]6, have voted in tandem on nearly every case thats come before them since [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]5 joined the [STREET] in [LOCATION]6. Theyve been more likely to side with the courts liberal justices than its other conservatives. The two justices, both alumni of the same GPE[ORGANIZATION]5-based federal appeals [STREET], have split publicly only once in 25 official decisions. Their partnership has extended, though less reliably, to orders the [STREET] has issued on abortion funding, immigration and the death penalty in [LOCATION][ORGANIZATION]5 since [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]5s bitter ORG23 confirmation battle ended in a 50-48 vote. I discussed the [PERSON]9-[PERSON][ORGANIZATION]5 alliance in connection with the [PERSON] unwillingness to hear cases regarding ORG25 and, at least so far, to hear key cases regarding the rights of gays and transgender individuals. The three solidly conservative Justices  [ORGANIZATION]0, [ORGANIZATION]1, and [ORGANIZATION]2  all have voted to hear these cases, but it takes the vote of a fourth Justice to make this happen. Chief Justice [PERSON]9 and Justice [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]5 have held out. What is [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]5s up to? [LOCATION] says that, having been accused of a [LOCATION]8 sexual assault during his confirmation process, he may just be laying low.  NOTE Another disappointing outcome for social conservatives.9[ORGANIZATION]5 [ORGANIZATION]3 I Support Things Like Gun Buybacks  Theyre Good Policy,  In Some Circumstances98 During a town hall on ORG26 on [LOCATION]9, DATE20 presidential candidate, former ORG2[ORGANIZATION]5 Secretary, and former [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]3 D expressed support for universal background checks, banning people who have committed domestic violence from getting guns, and magazine capacity limits, and said that gun buybacks are sound policy in certain circumstances. [ORGANIZATION]3 said, We need to make background checks universal. Theres no reason that somebody who has committed domestic violence should ever get their hands on a gun, right? We also need to limit the capacity of magazines, and we need to make sure that we do everything that we can so that people who get their hands on guns do so in a safe [STREET]. So, you know, I support making sure that we make those background checks universal. I support things like gun buybacks. I know that they have had mixed success, but I believe that, in some circumstances, thats a good policy, and that we can recover some weapons that shouldnt be out there on the [STREET]. [ORGANIZATION]3 continued that suicides committed with firearms need to be part of the conversation, and we need better investments in mental health. Comment [ORGANIZATION]3, an appropriate name.99 Confidence in Higher Education Plummets ORG28100 Confidence in higher education in [LOCATION] has dropped significantly since DATE21, according to polling company ORG28, which notes that its the worst-performing institution they measure. The crisis in confidence coincides with a similar decline in the publics view that higher education is affordable and available to those who need it, according to the report  suggesting that affordability and access are linked to the faith people have in the institution of higher learning.101 Controversial [LOCATION]er [ORGANIZATION]5 Possibly to [LOCATION] at ORG29, Officials Say102 [PERSON]0  [ORGANIZATION]0 officials said theyve received a facilities rental request for an event that possibly would feature controversial commentator [ORGANIZATION]5.103 [ORGANIZATION][ORGANIZATION]5 Calls Out [ORGANIZATION]8 for Describing 911 Attacks as Some People Did Something104 [PERSON] Democrat Ilhan [ORGANIZATION]8 is facing backlash after her speech at a Muslim rights groups event in which she described the [DATE] terror attacks as some people did something. [ORGANIZATION]8 spoke at a [ORGANIZATION]1 [ORGANIZATION]2 fundraiser DATE22, where she called upon other Muslim [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]5ns to make people uncomfortable with their activism and presence in the society and criticized the Jewish state. But another part of the speech surfaced on social media DATE23, in which [ORGANIZATION]8 described the terror attacks perpetrated by [ORGANIZATION]3. [ORGANIZATION]2 was founded after 911 because they recognized that some people did something, and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties, [ORGANIZATION]8 said at the event. The comments from the [PERSON] freshman Democrat, still reeling from a number of anti-Semitic controversies, prompted [PERSON]1 Rep. Dan [ORGANIZATION][ORGANIZATION]5 to slam [ORGANIZATION]8 for her description of the terror attacks. First Member of [ORGANIZATION]4 to ever describe terrorists who killed thousands of [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]5ns on 911 as some people who did something, [ORGANIZATION][ORGANIZATION]5 wrote in a tweet. [ORGANIZATION] Protects All [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]5ns Against the Tyranny of the Majority106 According to [ORGANIZATION]5, 13 states plus the GPE[ORGANIZATION]5all of which currently are bluewith a total of 184 electoral votes, have passed [ORGANIZATION] legislation [ORGANIZATION]6 is one of the most critical institutions created by the [ORGANIZATION] of the Constitution to ensure a stable representative government, yet its under attack. Eliminating or effectively neutering the Electoral Collegethe two options being proposed by many [LOCATION] fundamentally alter the country, which, of course, is exactly what progressives are hoping to do. This would be grievously wrong! Lets start with the basics of our [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]5n system, which is, by design, unlike any other. States, not individuals, are the original source of power. The states13 of them, anywaycreated the federal government. Less-populated states were understandably concerned they would be overshadowed by the larger ones, so they demanded protections within the Constitution. Giving every state, regardless of size, two senators was one of those protections. [ORGANIZATION]6 was another. Both concessions were intended to protect the minority against what is sometimes referred to as the tyranny of the majority, the concern that in a pure democracy the majority can do whatever it wants, regardless of how badly it might harm the minority. The [ORGANIZATION] did their best to create a representative political system that minimized the potential for a tyranny of the majority. They largely achieved their goal, though progressives have been successfully chipping away at those protections for DATE24. Comment [ORGANIZATION] should be illegal. It is an end run around the electoral college system. 10[ORGANIZATION]5 [ORGANIZATION][ORGANIZATION]5 Undergraduate Students Vote to Pay 2[ORGANIZATION]5 Per-Semester Fee for Slavery Reparations to Benefit Descendants of Slaves Sold by the School in DATE25 [ORGANIZATION][ORGANIZATION]5 students have voted in favor of a referendum seeking the establishment of a fund that benefits the descendants of enslaved people who were sold by the school in [DATE] to pay off its debts. The 2[ORGANIZATION]5.20-per-semester fee would create one of the first reparations funds at a major [PERSON]3 institution. More than 2,500 undergraduate students at the [ORGANIZATION]4 [PERSON]4 campus voted in favor on [LOCATION]9 for [ORGANIZATION] fee. The [ORGANIZATION][ORGANIZATION]5 Student Association Elections Commission said those in favor 2,541 represented 66 per cent of votes. The fee was opposed by 1,304 students and voting turnout was 5[ORGANIZATION]5.9 percent.109 [ORGANIZATION]9 Making Email More Secure With MTA-STS Standard110 Were excited to announce that [ORGANIZATION]9 will become the first major email provider to follow the new SMTP MTA Strict Transport Security MTA-STS RFC [DATE] and SMTP TLS Reporting RFC 8460 internet standards. Those new email security standards are the result of DATE2[ORGANIZATION]5 of collaboration within ORG40, with contributions from [PERSON] and other large email providers.111 [PERSON] Being Destroyed All Over the Western World112 They tell us that we are free, but it is just a lie. In every country in the western world, there is layer after layer of rules and regulations that strictly govern just about every area of our lives. But until just recently, there were certain lines that still had not been crossed. One of those lines has to do with bodily integrity. We have a fundamental right to say what goes into our bodies and what doesnt go into our bodies. When any government violates that fundamental right, no matter how good the intentions are, they have entered the realm of tyranny. And let there be no doubt  what is taking [STREET] in [PERSON]5 right now is tyranny. On DATE28, [PERSON]5 PERSON58or PERSON31 used the pretense of a public health emergency to order mandatory vaccinations for all of the Orthodox Jews living in [PERSON]6 Those who have not received the vaccine or do not have evidence of immunity may be given a violation and could be fined 1,000. Is this still [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]5? I am having a hard time believing that this is actually happening. There is no [STREET] that people would have ever put up with such nonsense DATE29. Even [PERSON]8 Governor PERSON32, a Democrat, is admitting that this effort to force mandatory vaccinations on city residents may be unconstitutional113 High School Suspends 2 Students for Posting Gun Range Photos on [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] Two male students at ORG44 in [PERSON]9 posted photos of guns on [ORGANIZATION]. One of the boys captioned his photo with hot stuff and if theres ever a zombie apocalypse, you know where to go. The photos were not taken at school. They were not taken during school hours. They did not reference a school. They auto-deleted after [PERSON]2, which was well before the school became aware of them. And yet, administrators at ORG44 suspended the boys for [ORGANIZATION]0, and also gave them [ORGANIZATION]1 detention. This was a clear violation of the students First Amendment rights, and the [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]5n Civil Liberties Union has now filed suit.115 PERSON33 Laughs ...kes at [PERSON] of PERSON34 PERSON33 responded to the arrest of PERSON35 by laughing and joking about it. [PERSON] claimed that PERSON3[ORGANIZATION]5 arrest had nothing to do with journalism and that the [ORGANIZATION] founder has to answer for what he has done, at least as its been charged.11[ORGANIZATION]5 PERSON38 is [PERSON]. Hes Far, Far Left.118 Laughably, PERSON39 is talked about as the moderate Democrat candidate for president. To be sure, PERSON39 has a far better persona than any of the other candidates. PERSON39 is the far-left extremist you can take home to meet your tradition-minded grandparents. PERSON39 will charm your neighborhood backyard party while flipping steaks on the grill. PERSON39 is the national Democrat you would most like to have a few beers and pizza with, regardless of political beliefs. In other words, PERSON39 is the best fake. PERSON39 is a liberal from a time when anti-[PERSON][ORGANIZATION]5n, at-war-with-reality, and even communist revolutionaries learned to hide who they really are. The only thing that has changed is that Democrats have decided that it is better now to be open and honest about their radical beliefs and agendas. Most Democrats have stopped pretending. PERSON39 is still pretending.119 PERSON40 Democrats Cant Win Based on Their Ideas, So They Want to Change the Rules of the Game120 One of the biggest criticisms of President [PERSON]1 is that he violates so-called democratic norms. Leading Democrats, think tank officials, and newspaper columnists have continuously wrung their hands over how everything from [PERSON]1s tweets to his legitimate criticisms of the mainstream media somehow threatens [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]5n governing institutions. [PERSON]1 has assailed essential institutions and traditions claims a left-wing outfit in a report issued [ORGANIZATION]2. Yet these same groups are conspicuously silent on Democrats blatant and unapologetic attempts to subvert [PERSON]3 founding institutions in their lust for power that they cannot achieve through the existing governing framework. In [ORGANIZATION]3, Democrats have called for abolishing the countrys constitutional voting system, allowing children to vote, and packing the ORG21.121 ORG48 Yanks Code After Some PCs [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] users left wailing as update borks older [ORGANIZATION] A bunch of PCs running the wares of ORG49 or [PERSON] have been freezing or failing to start following the installation of patches emitted by ORG48 on 9 [LOCATION]3.

[PERSON] for Business and [LOCATION] have been hit by the problem, as have PCs running [ORGANIZATION] managed by [ORGANIZATION] or ORG49 Enterprise [PERSON]. ORG48 said [TIME] that it had temporarily blocked devices from receiving this update if [ORGANIZATION] is installed, a move which, sadly, had come a bit late for those afflicted.123 [ORGANIZATION]0 Pricks Even PERSON42 [PERSON] on PERSON43 After a judge overthrew a [ORGANIZATION]1 Countys quarantine on people who arent sick but simply havent had a vaccine, now [ORGANIZATION] PERSON44 attacks a religious community in [ORGANIZATION]1 with threats of 1,000 fines.

The [ORGANIZATION]7 suspect was arrested after his girlfriend became worried that he had attacked her small [ORGANIZATION] apso after the dog began whimpering and hiding underneath a couch, the [ORGANIZATION]2ian reported. A police report says that when the dog was inspected, it was found injured and bloody. The woman asked the police to perform a rape kit on the animal and said that her boyfriend had talked of his interest in bestiality. According to officials, the suspects DNA was found among the dogs wounds. The animal was so injured that it was eventually euthanized. PERSON46 was arrested and later handed a [ORGANIZATION]8 jail sentence for raping the dog. The sentence is the maximum allowable by state law.12[ORGANIZATION]5 [ORGANIZATION]2s SB-9[ORGANIZATION]58 Gun Control Bill is So Hysterically Restrictive That Pepper Spray is a Felony128 A new gun control bill introduced in the [ORGANIZATION]2 State Legislature added 45 pages of draconian amendments [TIME] before the vote. SB9[ORGANIZATION]58 passed ORG54 [ORGANIZATION]9 and now heads to the [ORGANIZATION]2 ORG23. Its a good thing that some parts of this state have vowed to be 2A sanctuaries because [ORGANIZATION]2ians are going to need them. If the gun owners  and even pepper spray owners  in other parts of the state hope to defend themselves, they could be facing a vast new array of felony charges. The battle for the right to bear arms is rapidly spreading across the country. In [DATE]0,ORG[LOCATION]7 passed two sweeping national bills. [ORGANIZATION]3 has passed 6 outrageous new laws that sheriffs are refusing to enforce, and sheriffs in [ORGANIZATION]4 state are also rebelling. On the other stand, two states have introduced invasive laws requiring would-be gun owners to hand over access to [DATE]1 of personal social media. Whats in the unconstitutional bill, you ask?

Now for the Interesting Bit  How All That Raw Data Was Stored134 The black hole image released [ORGANIZATION]9 needed over a thousand helium-filled disk drives to record it. Regular drives were tried and tested but failed due to air pressure at the high altitudes of the radio telescope sites. Eight radio telescopes at six locations formed the FAC2 EHT array, which contributed the data used to calculate the image of the black hole in the Messier 8[ORGANIZATION]5 galaxy [ORGANIZATION]6 [PERSON] and [PERSON] at an altitude of 4,092m [ORGANIZATION]7 [PERSON] LOC2 4,600m [ORGANIZATION]8 FAC5 3,185m [ORGANIZATION]9 FAC6 observatory, LOC3 2,850m [PERSON]0 FAC7 5,100m and FAC8 5,000m telescopes, [ORGANIZATION] Telescope 2,800m EHT_telescope_sites In effect, they simulated a single radio telescope the size of planet [PERSON]. The telescopes take images as [PERSON] rotates to build a picture of the target area taken from different locations on the surface of the planet. The technique used to combine the signals is called very-long-baseline interferometry [ORGANIZATION], at a wavelength of 1.3mm, which uses hydrogen maser atomic clocks to precisely time stamp the raw image data. A specially developed algorithm combined and correlated the raw data to build the single overall image.135 ORG61, ORG59, And [ORGANIZATION] organizations encourage social media censors to claim that there is a surge in hate across the West A cluster of events [DATE]2 marked a steepening in the upwards trend toward online censorship. In a [PERSON]8 TimesSouthern Poverty Law Center ORG61 collaborative report about online extremism, authors claimed the social media sphere enabled a global network of white extremists to develop and that this has led to a surge of white supremacist and xenophobic terrorism in the West. Although grasping in its conclusions and broadly flawed, the report was no doubt a clear enough justification for many to continue the culling of speech freedoms online. In a near-identical report of its own, [ORGANIZATION] ORG59 described certain social media platforms having apparently become round-the-clock digital white supremacist rallies. They too conclude more policing from both industry and government had to be done. Both reports coincided with social media executives themselves being called to a hearing before ORG63 where it was demanded that they do more to stem white nationalist propaganda and hate speech online. The report seems to have uncovered not so much a surge in social media-enabled violence but the pervasiveness of social media in peoples everyday lives and the ease with which ones online reading and communication habits and criminal motives can be ascertained.13[ORGANIZATION]5 There is [ORGANIZATION] the Windows 10 20H1 Threshold138 [PERSON]ers keen to extricate themselves from the [LOCATION] programme have missed their chance for a quieter life as ORG48 booted them into the DATE20s with build 188[ORGANIZATION]55. Before [DATE]4, [ORGANIZATION] platoon of unpaid [PERSON] testers could have switched away without needing a reinstall, but no more.

[TIME], they publiPERSON3 an article about how PERSON49 removed all of his social media posts that reflected his conservative views. PERSON49 claims he removed them over his concern about affecting his chances with the [ORGANIZATION] [DATE] in the ORG64 draft. [PERSON]8 Post reports  PERSON48 has wiped some of his [ORGANIZATION]64 slate clean. The [ORGANIZATION] defensive end, who is projected to be one of the top picks in this [DATE]7 ORG64 draft, told ORG70 he deleted certain posts, including a [DATE]8 tweet in which he called former [DATE] quarterback PERSON50 a clown, due to his potential landing spot.141 Climate Strange Owing to Flight Shame, Some Swedes Feel Too Guilty to Fly142 What a civilization feels guilty about speaks volumes. In [PERSON]2, its not stealing children and putting them in abusive foster care, proposing a special tax on just one sex, trying to compel boys to tinkle sitting down, or silencing dissent with hate-speech laws. But pangs of conscience over flying on airplanes and increasing your [PERSON] are a different story. In fact, Swedes even have a name for such shame [ORGANIZATION] pronounced fleegskaam.143 Coffee Not Essential for Life, Swiss Government Says144 The Swiss government wants to put an end to its emergency stockpile of coffee after declaring that it is not essential for human survival. [PERSON]3 began storing emergency reserves of coffee between World War One and World War Two in preparation for potential shortages.

The takedowns come in just as the ORG73 is getting ready to vote on a proposal that will force platforms to remove terrorist content within [TIME] or face censorship through national firewalls, fines, and criminal sanctions. Even if it was possible for ORG78 to sift through tens of millions of documents in a collection targeted by one of these takedowns in [TIME] to figure out if the takedown notice is valid, the timezone problem means that they would have to be ready to do this in the middle of [TIME] in [ORGANIZATION], when the ORG73 agencies most typically send their demands. Even without this absurd law, the situation is dire. The French authorities gave ORG78 [PERSON]2 to comply with its demand or face a nationwide block.149 [PERSON] PERSON53 Fires Back After Leftist Hit Job, [PERSON] Sir [PERSON], the [PERSON] pre-eminent conservative philosopher, has held firm after the left-wing [ORGANIZATION]5 publiPERSON3 an interview parsed to make him look like a bigot, resulting in the Tory government sacking him from his role on the [ORGANIZATION]6, [ORGANIZATION] architectural commission.151 PERSON59s Secret Weapon PERSON55 Defects From Tories to Join [ORGANIZATION]7 PERSON55 joined PERSON[LOCATION]7 on stage on [LOCATION]5 to confirm she would be standing as [ORGANIZATION]8 candidate in the [ORGANIZATION]9 elections to help rescue our democracy and return the power of Government to the people.

Mr PERSON59 wrote in ORG92 ahead of [DATE]4s launch of what was nothing short of a national humiliation suffered by the [PERSON]5 at [ORGANIZATION], where Prime Minister Theresa PERSON58 secured yet another delay to [PERSON] to [LOCATION]6 [DATE], and lamented of the ineffectual lawmakers in ORG93 [PERSON]6 Will Not Soften Laws to Allow [PERSON]1 College to Stay in the Country1[LOCATION]7 [PERSON]6 will not relax rules for international universities despite pressure from the ORG73 and offers from [ORGANIZATION] to mediate in a row over a college founded by [PERSON]7 billionaire George [PERSON]1, a government spokesman said.

The lesson is clear if you plan to seek asylum in a foreign embassy, you should be careful to choose the diplomatic premises of a country a not likely to be pressurized into betraying you and b comfortable enough to make a long sojourn tolerable. The [DATE] [ORGANIZATION] reaffirmed the long-establiPERSON3 principle of inviolability of diplomatic premises. The host-countrys police and security forces are not allowed access without a specific authorization of the chief of mission, which was granted in this case. [PERSON]7 had spent almost seven [DATE]1 in the [PERSON]1ian embassy, after being welcomed there by the countrys former president [PERSON]8. The hosts political calculus has changed to his detriment over [DATE] [DATE]1, however. The British police arrested [PERSON]7 supposedly for skipping [PERSON]5 bail seven [DATE]1 ago, but alsoand far more importantlyunder a previously secret [PERSON]3 indictment. The exact charge is for conspiracy, with [PERSON]9, to hack into a classified [PERSON]3 government computer. [PERSON]7 lawyer PERSON70 said the allegations boil down to encouraging a source to provide him information and taking efforts to protect the identity of that source. [PERSON]7 had predicted that this would happen [DATE]1 ago, and stated it as his reason for seeking asylum in the first [STREET]. Sen.

To critics, climate change requires government action, and if that means the working class will have to endure more poverty and misery, thats just how it is. But as the gilets jaunes message spreads far and wide, the sentiment against fossil fuel taxes is becoming the strongest in neighboring [PERSON]4.

He told his audience that FAC1 has been shocked by the utter disaster of the Tory-led [PERSON] process, and that its a shame lawmakers inside the [PERSON]6 Bubble have failed to understand the will of the voters, PERSON59 said. There are several people in the [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]5n administration [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]5n administration who are looking on with incredulity that what they thought was a great country suddenly is being humbled by foreign bureaucrats. But some of PERSON59s most scathing criticism was reserved for Prime Minister Theresa PERSON58, whom he declared the worst prime minister in my lifetime, as well as the most duplicitous. I cant believe she has ever been involved in any negotiation of any kind at any point in her life. She is without doubt the worst Prime Minister in my lifetime and the most duplicitous  she says one thing and does the other again and again and again. The British people, particularly those who voted for [PERSON], are being treated with disdain, PERSON59 said. And the feeling that the [ORGANIZATION] politics has broken down has become pervasive.1[ORGANIZATION]53 [PERSON]5 Half of [PERSON]2ers [ORGANIZATION], One Third Complain of Cost of Living1[ORGANIZATION]54 A poll has found that a quarter of [PERSON]2ers feel they have no choice but to move out, with some citing the high cost of living, stress, and low quality of life in the city.

See if your state is on the list The Eleventh Circuit [PERSON]3 [STREET] of Appeals ruled that colleges in [LOCATION] are not required to admit illegal immigrant students.

Integration can not only be ordered, but integration must also be demanded.

The advancement of knowledge regarding etiology, onset, degrees or types of transsexuality was halted. It now costs the career of a social scientist who dares question a monolithic view of transgenderism. [PERSON] dogma authorizes only the narrative of the courageous, marginalized transgender whose only cure is gender transition. But there are so few transsexuals, to get any political traction from this nanominority, homosexual crusaders had to up trans numbers. They did this first by inflicting mass confusion through non-binary gender theory, and then by placing a glamorous, vestal victim transgender upon a shiny new cultural pedestal. The shift from transsexualism to transgenderism constituted a terrible moral degeneracy regarding personal responsibility. Transgenderism means [PERSON]05 disordered thinking that he is a woman is not [PERSON]05 problem, it is your problem. Big, burly [PERSON]06 takes some pills, slathers a ton of make-up on his stubbly face, and if you dont honor his womanhood, if you dare to call him sir even by accident, you are a phobic bigot. [PERSON]06 has a right to teach you a lesson you wont forget, to sue you, to slander you, even to destroy you, all for the [PERSON] cause. Oh, yes and [PERSON]06 has the right to beat the tar out of your daughter at sports, if you are foolish enough to let her compete against a boy. Lets say the world hadnt gone mad, people didnt require a parade down main [STREET] for committing sodomy, and there were no cultural overlords called [ORGANIZATION] needing to weaponize a rare mental disorder.

The state now has sued [PERSON]07 twice over the claim. A judge ruled in the first case that [PERSON]08 refusal to make the cake was protected by the First Amendment. The brief by [ORGANIZATION]56 makes the same argument but also asserts the same-sex couple fraudulently presented themselves as customers to provoke a lawsuit and, therefore, were unlawful trespassers. [PERSON]08 lawyers contend the couple, [PERSON]09 and [PERSON]10-Del Rios, conspired with one another andor aided and abetted one another in bringing what they know is a fraudulent and meritless complaint to collect a money judgment. They participated in a blatant abuse of process in bringing the complaint, with the goal of cashing in financially as well as harming [PERSON]11 and her [ORGANIZATION]57 [PERSON]06 Pence [PERSON]13 [ORGANIZATION] Than to Criticize My Christian Faith232 Vice President [PERSON]06 Pence on [LOCATION]8 broke his silence on repeated attacks from Democrat DATE20 presidential contender [PERSON]13, telling [ORGANIZATION]58 Squawk Box that the [ORGANIZATION]6 PERSON58or knows better than to attack his Christian faith.233 [ORGANIZATION]5 [PERSON] New Book How to be Poor234 [ORGANIZATION]5 has launched a new book, How To be Poor. The firebrand public figure announced the book was for sale on [ORGANIZATION]5 to his [ORGANIZATION]59 fans on [LOCATION]3 11th. The book is much shorter than his previous outing, [PERSON], clocking in at 54 pages. And the book already appears to be an instant success as it is already a 1 Best Seller in [TIME] Self-Help Short Reads according to [ORGANIZATION]5. In fact, its 1 in [ORGANIZATION]60 as well as 1 in Aesthetics in the Kindle Store.235 [ORGANIZATION]7 Democrat Pushes for Black Children to be Aborted236 Rep. [PERSON]14 wants to remove protections for black babies in proposed heartbeat bill [ORGANIZATION]7 Rep. [PERSON]14 D-[ORGANIZATION]8 filed an amendment DATE28 aiming to remove protections for African [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]5n babies in the heartbeat bill the [ORGANIZATION]7 [ORGANIZATION]38 is expected to pass [LOCATION]8. The heartbeat bill would ban abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected and allow the state to prosecute doctors who perform abortions after a heartbeat is found. During her testimony, [PERSON]15 argued black women should be allowed to abort their children to counter DATE96 atrocities.23[ORGANIZATION]5 [ORGANIZATION] Censorship238 National pro-life leaders celebrated a ORG23 hearing [LOCATION]8 on censorship by tech giants of pro-life voices and films. [PERSON]1 Sen. [PERSON]16 R hosted [ORGANIZATION] hearing titled, [ORGANIZATION] and the Public Discourse. The senator proposed [ORGANIZATION] censorship practices be dealt with through regulation, antitrust policies, and policing of fraudulent activities. Regarding [ORGANIZATION]64, [PERSON]17, president of [ORGANIZATION]65, said in a statement that the social media platform is misleading the public and their shareholders by claiming to be a free marketplace of ideas.239 Survey Finds That Half of [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]5s Pastors Are Afraid to [LOCATION] Out About Controversial Topics240 Have you ever wondered why most church services in [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]5 seem to be filled with lots of fluff and very little substance? As [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]5s moral foundations literally collapse right in front of our eyes, a large percentage of our pastors are afraid to speak out about controversial topics because they might offend someone. And it doesnt take a genius to figure out why they are so afraid. Most [PERSON]3 churches are shrinking, and more than 100 die DATE97. In DATE98 where pastors are judged by attendance numbers and budget levels, scaring people away is bad for business. With all that in mind, the results from a recent [ORGANIZATION]66 survey shouldnt be surprising at all241 Swedish Leftist MP Says We Assume That All Men Are Rapists242 Swedish [ORGANIZATION]67 MP [PERSON]18 asserted that women assume all men are rapists and demanded that all men take collective responsibility during a parliamentary debate. [PERSON]19 said that mens violence against women governs the entire world structure and that the struggle of feminism was to put a stop to the violence of men.243 The Architects of Western Decline  A Study on [ORGANIZATION]68 and Cultural Marxism Video244 This is the long overdue study of [ORGANIZATION]68 and Cultural Marxist philosophy which now controls Western intellectualism, politics, and culture. It was by design it was created by an internationalist intelligentsia to eradicate Western values, social systems, and [LOCATION]an racial groups in a pre-emptive attempt to spark global, communist think liberal revolution. [PERSON]20 historical notes are taken into the narrative.245 The [PERSON]3s Problem With PC-Culture Lack of Free Speech Will be [ORGANIZATION] Without free speech returning in full force to college campuses across [LOCATION], the country will see itself perish of politically correct induced culture. One [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]5n journalist says that the PC culture will be the entire countrys downfall. Nothing less than the [PERSON]3s survival is at stake, according to [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]5n journalist and author [PERSON]21. In DATE99, [PERSON]22 book, [TIME] in the [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]5n Empire How Corporations and Their Political Servants Are Destroying the [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]5n Dream, was released. The book details how corporations work with the government to kill the [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]5n Dream. Now hes saying that the suppression of free speech on college campuses has gone [STREET] too far, and unless people are allowed to think and say things freely once again without repercussions, the entire country will perish. As [PERSON]23 wrote in an article for [ORGANIZATION]16, [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]5 seems to have reached the point in its progressive development where those who seem to have literally lost their minds  much like the authority figures in [PERSON]24 masterful [LOCATION]00 novel, One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest  wish to institutionalize the remainder of the sane population. And [PERSON]23 is not far from that truth. [LOCATION]01 we are bombarded by the PC crowd telling us just what we can say and how we are allowed to say it. It is actually pretty difficult to say anything anymore without someone dictating the manner in which it can be said. And it all stems from [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]5s most insane of all asylums, college campuses.24[ORGANIZATION]5 [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]25 is [ORGANIZATION] to the Power of Gene Modification248 HUMANS are rapidly catching up with the natural process of evolution through the incredible powers of genetic engineering, according to a renowned futurist and author who thinks [PERSON]25 is coming. The global rise of genetic engineering is unavoidable and people need to look ahead to the future and be aware of the consequences that come with the technology. Equal parts terrifying and awe-inspiring, gene-editing has the potential power to eradicate hereditary diseases, prolong life and create a better and more efficient human species. But genetic tampering also the has the potential to create a significant divide between the rich and the poor, to decide which parts of our human physiology are desirable or beautiful and to ultimately question what it really means to be human. [PERSON]26, an advisor to [ORGANIZATION]69 on human genome editing, explores these issues and more in his upcoming book Hacking Darwin [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]  3 3496[ORGANIZATION]58  4 349652  5 349634  6 349604  [ORGANIZATION]5 349600  [DATE]  9 349[ORGANIZATION]538  10 349[ORGANIZATION]510  11 349632  12 [DATE]  13 3496[ORGANIZATION]54  [DATE]  15 349684  16 349[ORGANIZATION]532  1[ORGANIZATION]5 349[ORGANIZATION]524  [DATE]  19 349696  20 3496[ORGANIZATION]50  21 349610  [DATE]  24 349[ORGANIZATION]534  25 349646  26 349668  2[ORGANIZATION]5 349660  28 3496[ORGANIZATION]52  29 3496[ORGANIZATION][LOCATION]7  30 [DATE]  31 349[ORGANIZATION]550  32 349[ORGANIZATION]554  33 [DATE]  34 349[ORGANIZATION]552  35 349[ORGANIZATION]5[ORGANIZATION]50  36 349[ORGANIZATION][LOCATION]76  3[ORGANIZATION]5 349[ORGANIZATION]516  38 349644  39 3496[LOCATION]7  40 349[ORGANIZATION]526  [DATE]  42 349[ORGANIZATION]558  43 349[ORGANIZATION]514  44 349[ORGANIZATION][LOCATION]78  [DATE]  46 349[ORGANIZATION][LOCATION]74  4[ORGANIZATION]5 349[ORGANIZATION]542  48 349[ORGANIZATION]546  49 349[ORGANIZATION]548  50 349[ORGANIZATION]540  51 349638  52 [DATE]  53 349[ORGANIZATION]528  54 349[ORGANIZATION]530  55 [DATE]  [LOCATION]7 349[ORGANIZATION]50[ORGANIZATION]5  5[ORGANIZATION]5 349[ORGANIZATION]503  58 349614  [DATE]  61 349612  [DATE]  64 349606  [DATE]  6[ORGANIZATION]5 349[ORGANIZATION]544  68 349[ORGANIZATION]518  69 349[ORGANIZATION][LOCATION]72  [ORGANIZATION]50 349[ORGANIZATION]5[LOCATION]7  [ORGANIZATION]51 349[ORGANIZATION]536  [ORGANIZATION]52 349[ORGANIZATION]520  [ORGANIZATION]53 349662  [ORGANIZATION]54 349698  [ORGANIZATION]55 349626  [ORGANIZATION][LOCATION]7 349[ORGANIZATION]512  [ORGANIZATION]5[ORGANIZATION]5 [DATE]  [ORGANIZATION]58 349630  [ORGANIZATION]59 349682  80 349[ORGANIZATION]522  81 [DATE]  82 349[ORGANIZATION]500  83 349[ORGANIZATION]5[ORGANIZATION]52  84  85 topheadline  86  8[ORGANIZATION]5 topheadline  88  89 topheadline  90  91 topheadline  92  93 topheadline  94  95 topheadline  96  9[ORGANIZATION]5 topheadline  98  99 topheadline  100  101 topheadline  102  103 topheadline  104  105 topheadline  106  10[ORGANIZATION]5 topheadline  108  109 topheadline  110  111 topheadline  112  113 topheadline  114  115 topheadline  116  11[ORGANIZATION]5 topheadline  118  119 topheadline  120  121 topheadline  122  123 topheadline  124  125 topheadline  126  12[ORGANIZATION]5 topheadline  128  129 topheadline  130  131 topheadline  132  133 topheadline  134  135 topheadline  136  13[ORGANIZATION]5 topheadline  138  139 topheadline  140  141 topheadline  142  143 topheadline  144  145 topheadline  146  14[ORGANIZATION]5 topheadline  148  149 topheadline  150  151 topheadline  152  153 topheadline  154  155 topheadline  1[LOCATION]7  15[ORGANIZATION]5 topheadline  158  159 topheadline  160  161 topheadline  162  163 topheadline  164  165 topheadline  166  16[ORGANIZATION]5 topheadline  168  169 topheadline  1[ORGANIZATION]50  1[ORGANIZATION]51 topheadline  1[ORGANIZATION]52  1[ORGANIZATION]53 topheadline  1[ORGANIZATION]54  1[ORGANIZATION]55 topheadline  1[ORGANIZATION][LOCATION]7  1[ORGANIZATION]5[ORGANIZATION]5 topheadline  1[ORGANIZATION]58  1[ORGANIZATION]59 topheadline  180  181 topheadline  182  183 topheadline  184  185 topheadline  186  18[ORGANIZATION]5 topheadline  188  189 topheadline  190  191 topheadline  192  193 topheadline  194  195 topheadline  196  19[ORGANIZATION]5 topheadline  198  199 topheadline  200  201 topheadline  202  203 topheadline  204  205 topheadline  206  20[ORGANIZATION]5 topheadline  208  209 topheadline  210  211 topheadline  212  213 topheadline  214  215 topheadline  216  21[ORGANIZATION]5 topheadline  218  219 topheadline  220  221 topheadline  222  223 topheadline  224  225 topheadline  226  22[ORGANIZATION]5 topheadline  228  229 topheadline  230  231 topheadline  232  233 topheadline  234  235 topheadline  236  23[ORGANIZATION]5 topheadline  238  239 topheadline  240  241 topheadline  242  243 topheadline  244  245 topheadline  246  24[ORGANIZATION]5 topheadline  248  249 topheadline"

What is the threat, specifically? That it makes the public less willing to go to war with [PERSON] and its allies? That it makes us less trusting of lying, torturing, coup-staging intelligence agencies? Does accidentally catching a glimpse of that green ORG8 logo turn you to stone like [ORGANIZATION], or melt your face like in Raiders of [ORGANIZATION]? Well, it makes us lose trust in our institutions, is the most common reply. Okay. So? Wheres the threat there? We know for a fact that weve been lied to by those institutions. [ORGANIZATION] isnt just something we imagined. We should be skeptical of claims made by western governments, intelligence agencies and mass media. How specifically is that skepticism dangerous? [ORGANIZATION] argues that, because [PERSON]n propaganda is so dangerous what with the threat of British people having insufficient emotional exuberance during a possible naval battle and all, what is required is ORG9, an alliance of western state media that is tasked with combatting [PERSON]n counter-narratives. Because, in the strange [ORGANIZATION] ...agons fantasy fairy world in which [ORGANIZATION] penned her article, this isnt already happening. And of course, here in the real world, it is already happening. As I wrote recently, mainstream media outlets have been going out of their minds churning out attack editorials on anyone who questions the establishment narrative about what happened in [PERSON]. A [PERSON]0 reporter recently admonished a retired British naval officer for voicing skepticism of what were being told about [PERSON] on the grounds that it might muddy the waters of the information war that is being fought against [PERSON]. DATE0, [LOCATION], western mass media are pummeling the public with stories about how awful and scary [PERSON]ns are and how everything they say is a lie. This is because western mass media outlets are owned by western plutocrats, and those plutocrats have built their empires upon a status quo that they have a vested interest in preserving, often to the point where they will form alliances with defense and intelligence agencies to do so. They hire executives and editors who subscribe to a pro-establishment worldview, who in turn hire journalists who subscribe to a pro-establishment worldview, and in that [STREET] they ensure that all plutocrat-owned media outlets are advancing pro-plutocrat [ORGANIZATION] PERSON5, Best in the [PERSON]55 Opposed by Democrats, the media and a nefarious cabal of high government officials, this most unlikely president has implemented precisely what he promised on the stump. Despite [PERSON] worst efforts to bring him down, his record far exceeds even that of the great PERSON6 GPE6 is fortunate indeed that PERSON5 is [PERSON] President, just as we have been fortunate that we have always been so close to the worlds most powerful nation  first GPE8, then GPE9. It is crucial to GPE6 that the [PERSON] continue in her powerful role of preserving, protecting and defending [PERSON]ern civilisation based, as it is, on Judeo-Christian values.56 How Deep is the Deep State, Part 357 We have to look at these organizations in order to understand who is attempting to direct [PERSON]0 towards the one world order. They are everywhere and have infiltrated every concept of [PERSON]0n life. One that was co-founded by a member of the [ORGANIZATION] and PERSON8 administrations, [ORGANIZATION], is [PERSON]1. [PERSON]2 was established in DATE2. Its founder and primary financial angel was international financier, PERSON10, longtime chairman of the PERSON11 family-controlled [PERSON]3 and undisputed overlord of his familys global corporate empire. PERSON11s idea for establishing the commission emerged after he had read a book entitled Between Two Ages written by an ORG[ORGANIZATION]5 scholar, Prof. [PERSON] of [PERSON]5. In his book PERSON[ORGANIZATION]5 proposed a vast alliance between North [PERSON]0, [PERSON] and [PERSON]1. According to PERSON[ORGANIZATION]5, changes in the modern world required it. Resist as it might, PERSON[ORGANIZATION]5 wrote elsewhere, the [PERSON]0n system is compelled gradually to accommodate itself to this emerging international context, with the [PERSON]2 government called upon to negotiate, to guarantee, and, to some extent, to protect the various arrangements that have been contrived even by private business. In other words, it was necessary for the international upper class to band together to protect its interests, and to ensure, in the developed nations, that political leaders were brought to power who would ensure that the global financial interests of the PERSON11s and the other ruling elites would be protected over those of the hoi polloi To put it simply, [PERSON]7ists are saying The people, governments and economies of all nations must serve the needs of multinational banks and corporations. In short, [PERSON]6 is the current attempt by ruling elites to manage both dependence and democracy  at home and abroad. Another [PERSON]7 critic, now-retired Sen. PERSON15 R-[PERSON]3, views the commission as a PERSON11 family operation through and through. According to PERSON16 The [PERSON]7 organization created by PERSON10 was a surrogate  the members selected by PERSON11, its purposes defined by PERSON11, its funding supplied by PERSON11. PERSON10 screened and selected every individual who was invited to participate. 5 Members in this group are just as elite as in the others and youll see that many are members in some of the other groups as well. Youll also find many members of the military in this group as well PERSON17, Adm. PERSON18 ret., PERSON[PERSON]3, [ORGANIZATION]0, and [ORGANIZATION]1 are just a few.58 [LOCATION] in Unprovoked Spree at GPE[ORGANIZATION]5 Apartment Complex59 [PERSON]5  Nine people are hospitalized  some seriously  after a man went on a stabbing spree at an apartment complex in [PERSON]6, GPE[ORGANIZATION]5, that is home to many refugee families, police said. A [ORGANIZATION] man from out of state has been arrested in connection with the attack [TIME] that police said seemed to be unprovoked. This incident is not a representation of our community but a single evil individual who attacked people without provocation that we are aware of at this time, [PERSON]6 Police Chief [ORGANIZATION]2 said [PERSON] evening. Our community is reeling from this attack. Police said they do not know if the suspect is connected to the victims in any [STREET]. [PERSON]6 police got a call at [TIME] local time about a man with a knife attacking victims at the apartment complex. The suspect was located and taken into custody immediately, police said. The officers found the stabbing victims in the apartment complex and its parking lot, according to police. Nine were taken to a local hospital. The suspect is in custody and being interviewed at this time, the [PERSON]6 [INSTITUTION] said on its ORG29 feed. Victim witness coordinators and counselors are working with the victims and witnesses to provide them services in DATE5 ahead.60 Police Identify Man Arrested for [PERSON]6 Stabbing That Injured Nine61 [PERSON]5, GPE[ORGANIZATION]5 [PERSON]7  [PERSON]6 police have identified the man arrested for a stabbing that injured nine people [TIME], including six children. Police say PERSON[PERSON]0, [ORGANIZATION], of [PERSON]8, was arrested and charged with nine counts of felony aggravated battery and six counts of felony injury to a child. Officers say 4 of the nine people have life-threatening injuries. Some of the victims are members of the refugee community. Police say PERSON[PERSON]1 is not a refugee. Investigators say the preliminary evidence is showing that PERSON[PERSON]1 was a temporary resident at an apartment complex at FAC0 and FAC1, where the stabbings happened. Police say he was asked to leave the apartments [ORGANIZATION].  According to GPE[PERSON]3 [STREET] records, PERSON[PERSON]1 was arrested in [ORGANIZATION]0, GPE[PERSON]3, in DATE8 for stealing a mans wallet. He was given DATE9 probation as punishment.

Perhaps someone in [ORGANIZATION]1 gave him a bus ticket62 Revisiting the Violent Left of the [DATE] for Perspective on the Left [ORGANIZATION]163 In [LOCATION]0, PERSON[PERSON]2 went undercover for the ORG[PERSON]3 in the Weather Underground terrorist group. In this [LOCATION]1 interview with ORG20 [ORGANIZATION]6, [ORGANIZATION]7 talks about his experiences with [ORGANIZATION]8 and [ORGANIZATION]9 as they planned and executed terrorist bombings in [ORGANIZATION]2 and their ties to [ORGANIZATION]0 and [ORGANIZATION]1. What about the anti-[PERSON]0n left of [LOCATION]2? PERSON[DATE] was involved with the violent anti-[PERSON]0n left in movements like ORG21. In the video below, he explains why he decided to become an ORG[PERSON]3 informant initially to help stop a terrorist plot directed at [ORGANIZATION] in 2008.64 [PERSON] Out in GPE[PERSON]0 as ORG22 Activists Clash With Conservative Marchers65 Members of ORG22 clashed with members of the conservative group ORG[PERSON]0 [PERSON] evening in GPE[PERSON]0, GPE[PERSON]1, forcing police to declare that a riot was taking [STREET] as officers fired paintballs filled with tear gas into the crowd, according to the ORG[PERSON]1. Scuffles broke out shortly after [TIME] local time as ORG22 protesters pelted marchers from the conservative group with eggs, water bottles and firecrackers as the marchers spilled out into downtown GPE[PERSON]0 for their legally permitted march in support of a conservative Republican candidate for the [PERSON]2 Senate. The march followed an [TIME] rally at [ORGANIZATION], ORG26 reported.66 Viral Walk Away Videos Highlight Growing Movement of Democrats Leaving the Party67  They gather at his two [PERSON]6 groups, [DATE] and ORG28. Those who have the courage post their own video testimonials about the moment when the abuse, rage, and ugliness of the Democrats caused them to finally leave the party and walk away. This is so much more than a hashtag on ORG29, he said. This is a testimonial campaign, a grassroots movement that is going to change the political landscape of this country. And thats the astonishing twist here If these people have been driven into the arms of PERSON5, whos left on the left? See also PERSON[DATE] Why Liberals Have Flip-Flopped on Free Speech69 In a remarkably honest expos, [PERSON]0 acknowledged [PERSON] that liberals who once championed expansive [ORGANIZATION] rights are now uneasy about them ever since conservatives realized they should apply to them as well. The [PERSON]1 cites [ORGANIZATION] lawyer PERSON[DATE] who noted that whereas the left once led support for [ORGANIZATION] protections, they are now at least skeptical and sometimes distraught at the level of [ORGANIZATION] protection which is being afforded in cases brought by litigants on the right. [ORGANIZATION]5, a law professor at [PERSON]2, goes further still, declaring that free speech reinforces and amplifies injustice because it is now being used to defend ideas she finds distressing. Once a defense of the powerless, the [ORGANIZATION] over [LOCATION]3 has mainly become a weapon of the powerful, writes [ORGANIZATION]6, who teaches such courses as [ORGANIZATION] and Sex Equality. Whereas free speech used to be invoked to defend radicals, artists and activists, socialists and pacifists, the excluded and the dispossessed, [ORGANIZATION]6 laments, it has now become a sword for authoritarians, racists and misogynists, Nazis and [LOCATION], pornographers and corporations buying elections. In reading through [PERSON]0 piece it becomes abundantly clear that many liberals really never cared about free speech as such, but rather sought protection specifically for progressive ideas and behaviors. As soon as conservatives started demanding the same protections for their speech, it no longer seemed like such a good idea.70 [PERSON] Attacked on [PERSON]4 After Kicking Out Customer in [PERSON]7 Hat71 [ORGANIZATION]6s [PERSON] in GPE[PERSON]2 has been flooded with a wave of one-star [PERSON]4 reviews following a recent incident that saw a manager fired for refusing service to a man in [LOCATION] [PERSON]0 Great Again hat. [ORGANIZATION]7 was dismissed from the restaurant DATE[ORGANIZATION]5, [LOCATION]5 after asking a customer to remove the red [PERSON]7 hat, which signals support not just for PERSON5, but for his divisive and often racist policies. [PERSON]5, which owns the [PERSON], said in an emailed statement that it does not support intolerance of any kind and cannot discriminate against someone based on their support for the current administration in [ORGANIZATION]2 or any other bona fide political party. But [ORGANIZATION]8 was defiant, releasing a statement [ORGANIZATION] through [PERSON]6 standing by his decision. The [PERSON]7 hat has come to symbolize racism, bigotry, [LOCATION]9ophobia, misogyny, white supremacy, homophobia, [ORGANIZATION]8 said. As a person with a strong moral backbone, I had to take a stand against this guests choice of headgear while in my former [STREET] of work. Absolutely no regrets. News of the incident kicked off a tempest for the [PERSON]. [ORGANIZATION]8s name was trending on ORG29 in [ORGANIZATION]6 [ORGANIZATION] [TIME], as many took to social media to voice their support for his actions and their anger with the [PERSON]s response, which they believed aligned the popular brunch spot with racism and hatespeech, rather than in opposition to [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]7 [PERSON] for Allegedly Inciting Hatred Against Jews74 French prosecutors announced [ORGANIZATION] that they are investigating an imam for allegedly inciting hatred against Jews and violence against [ORGANIZATION]8 in a video-recorded sermon. Prosecutors said they will investigate [ORGANIZATION]0, imam at [PERSON], for comments he made in a [LOCATION]6 sermon in which he predicted the destruction of [ORGANIZATION]8 and cited a Hadith about Muslims killing Jews in [LOCATION]7, according to The [PERSON]1 of [ORGANIZATION]8. Video of the sermon, translated by [LOCATION]0 [LOCATION]1, garnered condemnation against [ORGANIZATION]1 from [LOCATION]2, the oldest Jewish advocacy and service organization in the world75 French Ambassador Praises Hungarian Prime Minister, [PERSON] in [ORGANIZATION]7 and [ORGANIZATION]9 Anti-Semitic76 A leaked confidential note from the French ambassador to [PERSON]0 has revealed praise for Prime Minister [ORGANIZATION]2 migrant policy, and has drawn ire from French president [ORGANIZATION]3. In the confidential note, which was addressed to FAC5 and top [LOCATION]3 officials, Ambassador [ORGANIZATION]4 defends the Hungarian leader, saying that the migrant policy of Prime Minister [ORGANIZATION]5 is a model for LOC2 and that many politicians in the west suffer from [PERSON]0ophobia, French broadcaster [LOCATION]4 reports.77 [ORGANIZATION]9s [LOCATION]5 Calls for a Fortress LOC2 at [ORGANIZATION] Representatives of [ORGANIZATION]9s right-wing populist [LOCATION]5 have urged the creation of Fortress LOC2 with the help of [PERSON]0s Viktor [ORGANIZATION]5 and [ORGANIZATION]7. Thousands protested [LOCATION]5 party [ORGANIZATION] in [PERSON]1. Some 600 [LOCATION]5 representatives gathered in [PERSON]1 for the start of a [LOCATION]8 [ORGANIZATION] of the German populist party on [PERSON], as left-wing protesters staged demonstrations in the Bavarian city. Addressing the delegates, senior [LOCATION]5 lawmaker [ORGANIZATION]8 slammed multiculturalism as a quixotic ideology and the great ideological fallacy of DATE[PERSON]3. [ORGANIZATION]9 also pushed for a new immigration policy that would turn the ORG[PERSON] into Fortress LOC2.79 Is Guilt Killing the [PERSON] From Within?80 A sense of guilt for colonialism is debasing the [PERSON] from within, according to Professor [PERSON], and authoritarian regimes such as GPE[DATE], [PERSON], GPE[DATE] and GPE[DATE] are profiting from this weakness. The Romans called it damnatio memoriae the damnation of memory that resulted in destroying the portraits and even the names of the fallen emperors. The same process is now underway in the [PERSON] about its colonial past. The cultural elite in the [PERSON] now seem so haunted by feelings of imperialist guilt that they are no longer confident that our civilization is something to be proud of. A sense of guilt now seems a kind of post-Christian substitute religion that seduces many [PERSON]erners. The French scholar PERSON51 suggested that this ideology is turning the [PERSON]erners into post-colonial subjects who no longer believe in their own civilization, but instead what will destroy it multiculturalism. In [ORGANIZATION]7, for example, a manifesto was launched for a multicultural and post racial republic. The result would be, in the words of the anthropologist [PERSON], a war of identities and a clash between communities. DATE20, the [PERSON]5 [LOCATION]7 leader [PERSON] said that, if elected Prime Minister, he would order [LOCATION]8 to return to [PERSON]6 the Elgin Marbles, the frieze that had surrounded the LOC4 of [PERSON]7 and one of the major attractions of [LOCATION]8. This whole campaign is sheer lunacy, wrote PERSON54. But it is a lunacy spreading all over LOC2. DATE21, in a book, The Tears of the White Man, the French philosopher PERSON55 wrote that, the remorseless and self-righteous critic who endlessly denounces the deceptions of parliamentary democracy is suddenly rapt with admiration before the atrocities committed in the name of the Koran, the Vedas, the Great Helmsman Since then, [PERSON]ern elites have excused many crimes committed in the name of political [LOCATION]9, as if these were the consequences of our own colonial crimes.81 [PERSON]8 4 Nuns Suspended for Mistreating Nursery School Kids82 Near [PERSON]9 [PERSON]0[PERSON]9, DATE22  Four nuns including two [ORGANIZATION], an Indonesian and an Italian mother superior were suspended DATE[ORGANIZATION]5 for allegedly mistreating nursery school children near [PERSON]9 north of [PERSON]1. They were suspended for DATE[PERSON]0 for mistreating the children, aged DATE[PERSON]1. The mother superior did not personally take part in the maltreatment but did nothing to prevent it, police said.83 [PERSON]8s Salvini Vows to Create Pan-LOC2an [ORGANIZATION] Parties84 Having taken [PERSON]8 by storm, and threatening to prematurely terminate the career of German Chancellor PERSON57 with his staunch opposition to further LOC2an migration, PERSON58  leader of [PERSON]8s populist League  said on DATE[PERSON]2 he wanted to expand its success to create a pan-LOC2an association of like-minded, nationalist parties.85 Meet the Germans Why [ORGANIZATION]9s Nudist Culture Remains Refreshing86 From lakes to saunas and parks Is [ORGANIZATION]9s nudist culture, known as [ORGANIZATION]1, dying out or still making waves? Its still strong enough to inspire a change of attitude for [LOCATION]-based expats. At first glance it seems like a regular beach scene Children running in and out the water, sandwiches being passed around families and couples sunning themselves. But on closer inspection most people at [PERSON], a lake in the south west of [LOCATION] have something in common. They arent wearing a scrap of clothing. And its a non-event. No one cares and no one is surprised. Theres nothing sexy about it. Its [PERSON]2C its DATE26 DATE27 and theres really no need for clothing if you dont feel like wearing it87 PERSON59s Friends and Foes in the ORG[PERSON]88 German Chancellor PERSON57 needs allies among ORG[PERSON] leaders in her search for a LOC2an solution to the migration crisis. But they are getting thin on the ground, and some have even come out against her. At the LOC2an level, German chancellor PERSON57 has been the undisputed number one head of state and government for some time. But since the beginning of the migration crisis, she is looking increasingly lonely. Especially now, given the domestic political pressures she faces, PERSON59 is more dependent on supporters in [PERSON]3. So, what can she expect from other leaders as they meet in [PERSON]3? The Partner If anyone can be called PERSON59s politicial friend, it is French President [ORGANIZATION]3. Like PERSON59, he is an advocate of a LOC2an solution to the migration problem. He, like her, sees the issue as axiomatic to the ORG[PERSON]s future existence. However, some in [ORGANIZATION]9 believe PERSON61 support comes at a high price. The sympathetic one New Spanish prime minister, PERSON62, may have acted in the spirit of PERSON59 when he took in boats with [PERSON]8n refugees, after the Italian government had turned them away. Such humanity is rare at the moment, but the socialist has also said that his country needs assistance in coping with migration. PERSON63 The trading nation of the [PERSON]4 is very interested in keeping the ORG[PERSON]s internal borders open. On that issue, its prime minister, PERSON64, agrees with PERSON59. On the other hand, the mood in the country is now more hostile to migrants. PERSON65 fence-sitting strategy means he could take a mediating [ORGANIZATION] in Dramatic Helicopter Escape90 A notorious gangster who was once [ORGANIZATION]7s most wanted, has pulled off an epic jailbreak, escaping from prison by helicopter, according to the [ORGANIZATION]2. PERSON67, [PERSON], was flown out of the FAC6 prison located in [PERSON]5 south-eastern suburbs on DATE[PERSON]2, aided by two heavily armed men, local police said. A [PERSON]6-registered helicopter landed in the courtyard of the prison, believed to be the only spot not protected by a net, sources told ORG26.91 [ORGANIZATION]3 Ruling Conservatives Gain in New Poll92 If parliamentary elections were held this DATE[PERSON]2, [ORGANIZATION]3 ruling conservative [ORGANIZATION]4 party would win 42.3 percent of the vote, according to a poll.93 Red Terror Alt-Left ORG22 Extremists Brag About Vicious Attack on British Identitarian Leader94 Alt-left ORG22 extremists have taken responsibility for a vicious attack on Generation Identity [PERSON]5 co-leader PERSON68, severely lacerating his face and allegedly leaving him unconscious for [TIME]. The politically motivated attack took [STREET] on DATE[ORGANIZATION]5 evening in the [PERSON]7 area of [PERSON]8, according to PERSON69, who said he had been in a pub in the area, then left and walked by a Kurdish community centre noticing a group of ORG22 extremists.95 Remembering Food Rationing Under Communism96 My elder aunt uses words of love to describe the menu for [LOCATION]2. She is a gourmet cook who likes to eat and uses all the fattening ingredients she can possibly find in her pantry in order to make everything tastier, sweeter, and more buttery. Unable to walk from the pounds she put on after the fall of communism in [ORGANIZATION]0, she cannot stop buying food. Most of her pension is spent on food, medicine, and rent. The survival mode that was etched into her brain during [ORGANIZATION]1 of communist rule is impossible to erase. People hoarded food [LOCATION] because they never knew when a more severe rationing or complete scarcity would commence, and food would be hard or impossible to find. Unless they had a severe hormonal illness, [LOCATION]ns were very thin and even gaunt under communism. [PERSON]erners joked that women were beautiful because they were on [ORGANIZATION]0 diet. The dear leader even passed a decree telling citizens exactly how much food and calories they could consume per day and how much they should weigh. Perhaps it would be hard for [PERSON]0n women to see that as a bad thing, considering they are obsessed with weight loss. Most [PERSON]0ns [LOCATION]2 dont understand what its like to starve or wait in line for food and return home empty-handed with a growling stomach after smelling fresh-baked bread. The younger generations are too far removed from the Great Depression and the soup kitchens of [ORGANIZATION]1 administration DATE[DATE]. Ive always cautioned my [ORGANIZATION]2 T-shirt-wearing students who express their love for communism Be careful what you wish for, because reality may be quite different from the romanticized version your clueless teachers describe, when they themselves have never lived [ORGANIZATION]7 under the boot of communism.97 [ORGANIZATION]3 Pressing for a [ORGANIZATION] in Secret Talks About [PERSON]9 After the ORG[PERSON]98 DONALD [ORGANIZATION]3 has pressed for a super-fast trade deal with [PERSON]9 in secret talks between one of his key advisers and [PERSON]. National security adviser [ORGANIZATION]5 has met the powerful LOC2an [ORGANIZATION], headed by [ORGANIZATION]6, to discuss [PERSON]9s post-Brexit relationship with the [PERSON]. Comment This is a great move by [ORGANIZATION]3. A [PERSON]-[PERSON]5 trade deal will help the [PERSON]5s position vis a vis the ORG[PERSON], hastening the ORG[PERSON]s demise. 99 [PERSON]5 [PERSON]8 DATE[DATE] Boy Arrested After Boy, [ORGANIZATION]5, Was [PERSON] [PERSON]1 in the Street100 An DATE[DATE] boy has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a teenager was stabbed several times in the middle of a north [PERSON]8 [STREET].

The Right Honourable Lord Justice [PERSON], the most senior criminal judge in [PERSON]4, will hear PERSON80s appeal at [ORGANIZATION], in [PERSON]8, on [PERSON]5 at 10am.107 Opinion [PERSON]5, [PERSON]6 Accession Talks  the ORG[PERSON] Never Fails to Disappoint108 [ORGANIZATION]7 and the [PERSON]4 have sacrificed the ORG[PERSON]s credibility in the [PERSON], punishing [PERSON]5 and [PERSON]6 in order to appease populists. Its a dangerous and short-sighted move, says [ORGANIZATION]7 PERSON84. An ORG[PERSON] candidate country since [PERSON]6, and recommended for accession negotiations nine times, [PERSON]5 has never been spared humiliation and disappointment in its relations with the [LOCATION]3. For [PERSON]7 [PERSON]6 blocked the Balkan country over the name dispute. Now that the disputeis nearing an end, the future North [PERSON]5 rightfully hoped to receive its just reward. But the ORG[PERSON] managed to disappoint the country once again. Instead of recommending a date to start the accession negotiations as promised, the ORG[PERSON] has announced it will set out a path towards opening accession negotiations in [DATE] 20[PERSON]3. The same fate befell [PERSON]6, [PERSON]5s western Balkan neighbor. Victims of ORG[PERSON] politics Both [PERSON]5 and [PERSON]6 are victims of internal ORG[PERSON] disagreements [ORGANIZATION]7 and the [PERSON]4 wanted to postpone the LOC2an [ORGANIZATION] plan for negotiations mainly because of their own internal political considerations. And although French President [ORGANIZATION]3 for his part has argued that the ORG[PERSON] shouldnt accept more members before carrying out its own internal reforms, ORG[PERSON] officials have indicated [ORGANIZATION] is actually afraid that French populists and right-wing movements would use accession to drum up fears of migration from eastern LOC2. The governments in [PERSON]9 and GPE60, as well as the LOC2an [ORGANIZATION] tried to put a positive spin on the decision, praising it as historical, but it would take an enormous effort to find much to celebrate109 Population Alarming Decline in [PERSON] and [PERSON] particularly significant in the [PERSON] [PERSON]0BELGRADE, 29 PERSON86  Many countries in [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]0-eastern LOC2 are witnessing a worrying phenomenon of reduction of their population, at an alarming rate, while the population in [PERSON] is at the same time increasing, according to the report LOC2an [ORGANIZATION], made recently public by ORG61 of ORG62 and ORG63. LOC2 [LOCATION]2 remains divided by long-term population trends and this division mostly follows the past geopolitical cleavage between [LOCATION] and [PERSON], the report states. The [PERSON], [PERSON]0, and [PERSON]1 LOC2, in particular the richest regions and [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION] and [LOCATION],, are witnessing a rising population sizes, to be explained as combination of minor natural population increases and higher levels of immigration than emigration. At the same time, almost all countries in [PERSON]2, [PERSON]0-[ORGANIZATION], and [ORGANIZATION] LOC2 saw substantial population declines, due to a combined effect of natural population decrease and emigration. According to data quoted in the report, the [PERSON] are one of the region most affected by a negative population change, with a rate unprecedented in times of peace, the study noted. In GPE65, the population declined by 22 between [PERSON]390 and [DATE], in [LOCATION] by [PERSON]3, in [LOCATION] by 15, in GPE68 -13, in GPE69 -8. A significant drop of population was registered also in [PERSON]0 -[PERSON]3, in [PERSON]1 -27 and [PERSON]2 -[PERSON]0, less significant in [PERSON]0 -6, while [PERSON]3 2, [PERSON]4 and [PERSON]5 3 registered a slight increase in their population in DATE50 World View [PERSON] and [PERSON] Create Humanitarian Catastrophe in [PERSON]6 The assault that began on [DATE] [PERSON]3 of the combination of the army of [ORGANIZATION] president PERSON87 and bombs from [PERSON]n warplanes is threatening a massive humanitarian disaster greater than the combined sizes of the humanitarian disasters at [PERSON]7 and [PERSON]8. [PERSON]9 is supposed to be part of a de-escalation zone, based on peace talks DATE52 in GPE80, [ORGANIZATION], between [PERSON], GPE[DATE], and GPE[DATE]. An outcome was that [PERSON] and the [PERSON]2 agreed that the [PERSON]2 would oversee the ceasefire in [PERSON]9. Promises and agreements mean nothing to [PERSON] and [PERSON], and they never intended to honor the ceasefire. The [PERSON]2 does usually honor its promises, but in this case has chosen not to intervene, rather than get pulled into yet another war, this time a full-scale war with [PERSON] and [PERSON].113 [LOCATION]n Man Marries DATE53 Thai Girl1[ORGANIZATION]5 GPE82 The marriage of a [LOCATION] man with a DATE[DATE] Thai girl in the Muslim majority country has sparked outrage with one activist [ORGANIZATION]7 labeling the groom a child predator. [LOCATION]n Muslims DATE54 are allowed to marry if they obtain the permission of a religious [STREET]. But the countrys women and families ministry said there was no record of religious authorities approving the union, which took [STREET] DATE55 across the border in GPE84 largely Muslim far south. Our officers have gone to the house and met the girls mother.

[ORGANIZATION] of GPE85 said on [ORGANIZATION]0 that the current death toll in the countrys [PERSON]5, based on attacks that began last DATE[ORGANIZATION]5 and continued until DATE[PERSON]2, stands at 218. The killings are a result of clashes between the radical Muslim [ORGANIZATION] herdsmen and local area farmers near the city of GPE86, many of whom are Christians, though officials have not yet identified how many of the victims belong to each group. Organizations representing the [ORGANIZATION] have denied that they are responsible for the attacks, [ORGANIZATION]P reported, though police say that the cattle-herders are indeed to blame. GPE87 Governor [ORGANIZATION]0 revealed that sophisticated weapons were used in the latest attacks on farmlands, which he said were reflective of a terrorist invasion.117 [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]1 Wins GPE88 Election According to [PERSON] Poll118 [ORGANIZATION]2 is likely to have won the GPE88 presidential election by [DATE] according to the [PERSON] exit poll.1[PERSON]3 German [PERSON] Minister Offers to Resign in [ORGANIZATION] Showdown With PERSON59120 [ORGANIZATION]9s interior minister [ORGANIZATION]3 on DATE[PERSON]2 said he wants to resign both his office and his position as head of the hardline conservative [ORGANIZATION], throwing into question the future of Chancellor PERSON57s coalition government.

He also added that he will stay in politics if PERSON57s ORG70 backs down in the two parties deadlock over migration, ORG71 reports.1[PERSON]2 [ORGANIZATION]9 PERSON59 Coalition Govt on [ORGANIZATION]6 as [PERSON] Minister [PERSON] Over Immigration126 [PERSON]  [ORGANIZATION]9s interior minister and head of [ORGANIZATION] reportedly offered his resignation from both posts DATE[PERSON]2 night rather than back down from his stance against Chancellor PERSON57s migration policies, as the crisis within her governing coalition came to a head. The ORG74 news agency, citing information from unidentified participants, reported that a nearly [TIME] meeting of the [ORGANIZATION] in GPE90 was put on hold after [PERSON] Minister [ORGANIZATION]3 made his offer. ORG75 reported that [ORGANIZATION]7, the leader of the [ORGANIZATION] in parliament, told others [ORGANIZATION]5 could not be allowed to resign. If [ORGANIZATION]5 does step down, it was not immediately clear what effect the move would have on a [ORGANIZATION]3 impasse between PERSON59 and her Bavarian-only [ORGANIZATION] partners, which has centered around his resolve to turn away some types of asylum-seekers at [ORGANIZATION]9s borders.127 Illegal Immigrant Arrested for Starting a GPE91 Fire That Charred 40K Acres128 GPE91 authorities arrested an illegal immigrant [PERSON] for allegedly starting a string of wildfires in the state that have consumed more than 40,000 acres and has not yet been contained.

Globalist ORG[PERSON] bigwigs and ORG82 bosses all celebrated the plan. Even some ostensibly populist leaders expressed support due to some minor concessions they secured. But as [PERSON]ern governments continue to promote mass immigration from [PERSON]6, the latest polls show LOC2ans, like [PERSON]0ns, are overwhelmingly opposed  and public outrage is reaching a boiling point. Meanwhile, warnings that tens of millions of migrants are waiting to pour in are growing louder.139 [PERSON]0 Koreans Resist Arrival of GPE96i Asylum Seekers[ORGANIZATION]50 There has been a backlash after a thousand GPE96is exploited a visa loophole to apply for refugee status. Many [PERSON]0 Koreans are concerned that Muslims will fail to integrate into their society. An influx of nearly 1,000 GPE96i asylum seekers into the [PERSON]0 Korean resort island of GPE95 has triggered a fierce backlash against immigration rules that many [PERSON]0 Koreans perceive to be lax and dangerous to the well-being of their society. The concern has grown suddenly with 950 foreign nationals  the majority fleeing conflict-wracked GPE96  applying at [ORGANIZATION] for legal refugee status after arriving as tourists.

You read that right ORG90 is a ORG88 program, and is supported by ORG91. As a result, [PERSON]0n government schools are failing our students. Fifty percent of [PERSON]0n graduates cannot read, write and do simple math. PERSON102 admitted its failure. More money is his answer. We all know that the only thing that will affect change is a return of the curricula back to traditional education, WHICH WAS A HUGE SUCCESS ORG90 forces a child to think in a box with little hope for a future not in line with the predetermined government goal. ORG90 is based on the premise that people are stupid and the smart academics know best. To rise against their desired response often causes a child to be bullied or act out just to make their ideas known. Drugs, massive piercing, drinking, murder, terrorism, suicide are often the result of feeling hopeless. ORG90 manipulates emotion and eliminates individualism, forcing a child into groupthink, not innovation and creation. Emotion become dominant with no logic reason balance. A person can only think of one thought at a time. By forcing overuse of right brain function emotion the left brain logic and reason become dormant from lack of use. [ORGANIZATION]1, aside from being functionally illiterate, too many people are motivated by a trigger that unleashes unbridled emotion too often resulting in violence or suicide. Continuing to do the same thing over and over, expecting different results, is insane, as we have heard over and over. ORG90, [PERSON], ORG92, [PERSON] all assist in diminishing the capacity of [PERSON]0s future. Yet we ignore the facts and continue to push this horrid programs filled with errors, omissions and bias. Have we learned nothing from [ORGANIZATION]2 of failing grades? Why are we forcing [PERSON]0s children to follow a failed program? [ORGANIZATION] based on collectivism not individualism, training not education and values not facts, according to the brilliant educator PERSON103, is to change and alter the society. This is not education. It is indoctrination. She promotes outcome based education. Our childrens destiny will now be chosen by a computer. How many more generations of [PERSON]0ns will we lose to this indoctrination called education?

Our mission was to minister [ORGANIZATION], warn the wicked and rescue the perishing at several venues. First up was [STREET] preaching at a local mosque. We did not go to be mean, hateful, or to pick a fight with Muslims  we went to give them the Good News of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Our plan was to witness to Muslims as they entered their mosque for their [ORGANIZATION] call to prayer. But to our surprise, upon our arrival, we discovered there WERE NO Muslims  their call to prayer had been cancelled. And while the mosque was situated in a Muslim neighborhood, none came out of their homes or apartments. What DID we encounter? The entrance to the mosque was being guarded by about 500 self-professing Christians, and [PERSON], standing arm-in-arm with pagans, witches, and homosexuals. YOU HEARD ME RIGHT. Their message was Love Over Hate. Of course, WE were deemed the haters, as we came with the truth  right out of Gods Word. Somehow, they had heard we were coming, and they arrived ahead of us, and these so-called Christians chanted and shouted PROFANITY at us, as they stood in solidarity with the false god of [LOCATION]9, Wiccans, Pagans, [PERSON] and sodomites.

This is slightly better than the 4.9 percent prediction in [DATE]. GPE83s economy will contract six percent, [ORGANIZATION] and GPE3 10.6 percent. [PERSON]s economy will grow by 1.9 percent. However, for [ORGANIZATION], the [ORGANIZATION] expects [ORGANIZATION] growth of 5.4 percent.110 Soaring Food Costs Send Producer Prices Higher in [PERSON] While Energy costs are lower -0.3 [ORGANIZATION] 11.4 [ORGANIZATION], Food costs are the biggest incremental driver of the hotter than expected inflationary print, rising 1.2 [ORGANIZATION] 13.3 [ORGANIZATION].1[PERSON] Swedish Democrats Want to Give Over [DATE] to All Citizens113 The Swedish Democrat party wants to give all citizens in [PERSON] over [DATE], while children will get over 550. This was revealed during their shadow budget. they want to give everyone a one off payment in order to increase consumption.114 [ORGANIZATION] From Posting Link to ORG7 [ORGANIZATION] Lobbying Story115 ORG56 has followed [ORGANIZATION]s example by censoring a ORG7 article about PERSON58 [ORGANIZATION]s foreign lobbying scandal after users were prevented from tweeting links to the story, leading one [ORGANIZATION] editor to describe the move as an act of digital civil war. As we highlighted earlier, [ORGANIZATION] announced that it would be preventing the story from spreading on its site after the companys [ORGANIZATION] Manager and lifelong [ORGANIZATION] operative [PERSON] said the company had buried the article in its algorithm.116 Facts Do Not Matter to [ORGANIZATION]0117 One of the hallmarks of totalitarianism is mass conformity to a psychotic official narrative. Not just a regular official narrative, like the Cold War or the War on Terror, or even a myth like the [PERSON] Dream. A totally delusional official narrative that has little or no connection to reality and that is contradicted by a preponderance of facts Their initiation into [ORGANIZATION]0 began in [PERSON], when the medical authorities and corporate media turned on The Fear with projections of hundreds of millions of deaths and fake photos of people dropping dead in the streets. The psychological conditioning has continued for [ORGANIZATION]. The global masses have been subjected to a constant stream of propaganda, manufactured hysteria, wild speculation, conflicting directives, exaggerations, lies, and tawdry theatrical effects. Lockdowns. Emergency field hospitals and morgues. The singing-dancing [ORGANIZATION]1 staff. Death trucks. Overflowing ICUs. [PERSON] babies. Manipulated statistics. [PERSON] squads. Masks. And all the rest of it. Eight [ORGANIZATION] later, here we are. The Head of ORG[PERSON] at the [ORGANIZATION]3 has basically confirmed an IFR of 0.14, approximately the same as the seasonal flu. And here are the latest survival rate estimates from [ORGANIZATION]4 DATE8 99.997 DATE9 99.98 [LOCATION]0 99.5 [LOCATION]1 science argument is officially over. An increasing number of doctors and experts are breaking ranks and explaining how the current mass hysteria over so-called cases which now includes perfectly healthy people is essentially meaningless propaganda, for example, in this segment on [ORGANIZATION]5, one of the big mainstream German TV channels. And then there is the existence of [PERSON], and other countries which are not playing ball with the official [PERSON]-19 narrative, which makes a mockery of the ongoing hysteria.118 PERSON7, PERSON8 GPE5 [ORGANIZATION]6 Member [PERSON] on Hidden Camera Talking Violent Revolution119 Prominent [ORGANIZATION], who sits on the executive committee for [ORGANIZATION] and chairman of leftist organization [ORGANIZATION]7 was caught on undercover footage by [ORGANIZATION]8 promoting a violent agenda for far-left Democrats if President [LOCATION]0 wins in [PERSON]. I am going to do everything morally acceptable to win. I will lie. I will cheat. I will steal. Because thats morally acceptable in this political environment. Absolutely. We are pirates on a pirate ship, said [LOCATION]1, who functions as trainer, mentor and on-the-ground quarterback at [ORGANIZATION]7 protests. I want to make this point very loudly and very clearly. I said it nicely before, but [PERSON] say it more curtly now. [LOCATION] is a political revolution, he added [LOCATION]1 deleted his ORG56 account following the [ORGANIZATION]8 release.[PERSON]0 A [TIME]? Early Voting is Shattering Previous Levels as Voters Flock to the Polls in Droves[PERSON]1 Would you be willing to wait [TIME] to cast a vote on [LOCATION]3 of early voting? As you will see below, that is precisely what just happened in [LOCATION]. We have become accustomed to seeing long lines to vote on [LOCATION]4, but in [LOCATION] we are witnessing colossal lines to vote [LOCATION]5 before the election. And this is happening even though tens of millions of [ORGANIZATION] will be casting their votes through the mail [LOCATION]6. The numbers that I am going to share with you in this article are eye-popping, and they seem to indicate that there is an unprecedented amount of interest in this election. In recent [ORGANIZATION] there has been a tremendous nationwide effort to encourage people to vote in [LOCATION], and it appears that it is working. A professor at [ORGANIZATION]9 named PERSON[PERSON] is compiling voting data from all 50 states, and his numbers show that more than 11.9 million [ORGANIZATION] have voted so far in [LOCATION]. But back in [LOCATION]8, only about 1.4 million voters had cast ballots as of [PERSON]06th. Of course one of the big reasons why so many [ORGANIZATION] have voted already is because voting by mail has been aggressively pushed all over the nation this time around.[PERSON]2 After Tearing [PERSON] Statues of [LOCATION]3 amp38 [LOCATION]4, [PERSON] Statue Thats a Giant Pile of Trash[PERSON]3 The statue, which theyre calling the second [ORGANIZATION], is a giant pile of trash. Comment A reflection of their thought process.[PERSON]4 [LOCATION]5 Addresses Accusations She is a White Colonist Because of [ORGANIZATION] Hearings[PERSON]5 [PERSON] nominee [LOCATION]5 addressed accusations that she was a white colonizer because of her adopted children during [LOCATION]9 confirmation hearing.[PERSON]6 As More Parents Choose to Homeschool, School Bureaucrats Try to Stem the Tide[PERSON]7 As families say goodbye in record numbers to government schools, school officials arent letting go of families easily. For example, on [DATE]0, Gov. [LOCATION]6 issued an executive order to allow the state ORG21 to issue guidelines to provide for the creation of remote learning enrichment programs in which children who are enrolled in school during [TIME] of a school day can attend remote learning instruction. Also, ORG22 released guidance called [ORGANIZATION] Remote Learning Models. While neither of these explicitly interfere with the ability of parents to homeschool or to create homeschool co-ops or pods, the devil is in the details. The guidelines state that entities that provide supervision and care of children during [TIME] without an ORG23 license or ORG23 license exemption will be subject to investigation, closure, and fines by ORG23 pursuant to its statutory obligation to investigate unlicensed child care programs. GPE7 is by no means the only state to do such a thing. In GPE8, state authorities may actually require a permit for families to get together. Sadly, the existence of such policies forces families to pore over pages and pages of regulations to figure out whether a new policy applies to what churches, community groups, or families are doing. If parents have developed a group to care for their own children, even with the help of trusted adults, they should not be required to wade through state guidelines and risk being investigated. Our first response should be to empower parents to grapple with the uncertainties of educating their children during the pandemic. We can trust parents to figure out what is best for their kids. School officials in [ORGANIZATION], are demanding parents to comply with requests that are not permitted by the law. For instance, GPE7 homeschoolers are not required to document and prove residency status, provide the birth certificates of their children, participate in [DATE]1 [PERSON] meetings, or submit multiple assessments.[PERSON]8 [ORGANIZATION] or Die Sign Spotted in [ORGANIZATION]0 A woman in [ORGANIZATION]1 is selling [ORGANIZATION] or Die campaign signs as a sure fire [STREET] of winning hearts and minds as [DATE]2 looms closer. The signs are being sold for a whopping 32 by a woman called [LOCATION]7 on her website ORG25, which also sells [ORGANIZATION], including one that says compassion oh, the irony. We cannot let dumpy win! All proceeds go to making more stuff like this for my own neighborhood, states the description for the product. As ORG26 highlights, [LOCATION]8 appears to have an obsession with the occult.130 [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION]9 Reportedly Didnt Really Want to Get [LOCATION]0, He Was Being Protected131 National File can provide recordings of a conversation between former GPE[PERSON] Rep. [LOCATION]1 R-PA, [LOCATION]2, the CEO of ORG27, and [ORGANIZATION] associate and attorney [LOCATION]3, in which [LOCATION]4 claims he has verifiable intelligence about the whereabouts and patterns of movement of ORG28 terrorist leader [LOCATION]5 who, according to [LOCATION]4, traveled to [ORGANIZATION]3 for extended stays in which he would vacation and participate in elite level falconry hunting. According to [LOCATION]4 in the conversation recorded on [DATE] 2, 2011, [LOCATION]6 traveled to [ORGANIZATION]3 for between three and five [ORGANIZATION] DATE71 for the purpose of participating in elite level falconry hunting. [LOCATION]4 explained to [LOCATION]7 that he learned this when speaking directly with those responsible for organizing the hunts, who offered extensive details about [LOCATION]6s whereabouts in the country, information about a temporary hostage used to insure [LOCATION]6s good behavior while in the country, and other sensitive information about the terrorist leader.132 ORG29 85 of [ORGANIZATION] Patients Report Always Or Often Wearing a Mask133 An underreported, recently-published ORG29 study adds to the pile of evidence that cloth masks or other forms of mandated face coverings only contribute negatives to our [ORGANIZATION] problem. The study also displays  despite the constant accusations of widespread misbehavior from public health officials  that [ORGANIZATION] are adhering to mask wearing, but mask wearing is not doing us any good.134 [LOCATION]9 Suggests ORG30 Director PERSON30 May be Part of Coup to Take [PERSON] [LOCATION]0135 [LOCATION]9 has been trying to get remaining [PERSON]gate documents from ORG30 Director PERSON30, but shes been stonewalling and refusing to comply. PERSON31 suggested [TIME] that PERSON32 could be protecting herself because shes part of the coup to take down [LOCATION]0136 ORG30 Whistleblower Exposes [ORGANIZATION]s Alleged Role With the Deaths of [ORGANIZATION]  Claims to Have Documented Proof137 In this article is a full interview of [PERSON], [PERSON] [LOCATION]4, who is being interviewed by PERSON34 and PERSON35. It surfaced on [DATE]5 and shows the three talking about the blackmail extortion of 152 Billion [ORGANIZATION]6 dollars, that was sent to [ORGANIZATION]3 to cover up the deaths of [ORGANIZATION] 6 by the [LOCATION]9[ORGANIZATION] administration. [LOCATION]4, a former ORG30 agent, has extensive experience with the intelligence community, and he is planning on releasing documents [DATE]6 on what he said are going to uncover numerous crimes sprees. The following are updates that have unfolded since the article was originally published138 [ORGANIZATION] Censors Story About [ORGANIZATION] Foreign Lobbying Scandal139 [ORGANIZATION] is censoring the bombshell ORG7 story about PERSON58 [ORGANIZATION]s foreign lobbying scandal by deliberately reducing its spread on the platform. [DATE]7, the newspaper revealed how [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION] had introduced his father, then-Vice President PERSON58 [ORGANIZATION], to a top executive in a [LOCATION] energy firm [DATE]8 before [ORGANIZATION] pressured the government of [ORGANIZATION]4 to fire a prosecutor who was investigating the company.140 Federal Judge Says Inmates Eligible for 1,200 Stimulus Checks141 A [ORGANIZATION]5 judge has ruled that incarcerated inmates are eligible to receive the 1,200 stimulus check issued by the federal government as support during the coronavirus pandemic. PERSON39, a federal judge for the GPE[PERSON] District [STREET] for [LOCATION] of [ORGANIZATION]5, said excluding incarcerated people from the stimulus package is arbitrary and that nothing in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act bars inmates from receiving funds. The decision came after an incarcerated man and a group of formerly incarcerated women filed suit on behalf of the 1.5 million prisoners across the country. The [ORGANIZATION] had originally sent payment to prisoners, but later told prison officials to collect and return checks that arrived at facilities for prisoners.142 [ORGANIZATION]0 Says Life Can Return to Normal Only After We Pay Him for the Second Generation of [PERSON]s143 The only [STREET] well get completely back to normal is by having, maybe not the first generation of vaccines, but eventually a vaccine that is super-effective, and that a lot of the people take, and that we get the disease eliminated on a global basis, [ORGANIZATION]0 said [DATE]5 in an interview on [ORGANIZATION] program. That is where we can finally start taking all the problems that have been created  in education, mental health  and start to build back in a positive [STREET]. According to that standard, [ORGANIZATION] might need to live for [DATE]9, or for life, under social-distancing guidelines and other [PERSON]-19 restrictions. Its certainly gloomier than the assessment [ORGANIZATION]0 gave in a ORG35 interview [ORGANIZATION]0, when he said progress on vaccines might make it possible for a return to normalcy in the [ORGANIZATION]6 by the DATE87 of [ORGANIZATION].144 [LOCATION] Rep. [ORGANIZATION]1 Introduces Legislation to Remove [ORGANIZATION]2 as ORG36 Speaker145 Rep. [ORGANIZATION]1 R-[ORGANIZATION]7 introduced a resolution on [ORGANIZATION]2 to push for the removal of Rep. [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]2 D-[ORGANIZATION]8 from her position as Speaker of the ORG36. The resolution claims [ORGANIZATION]2 does not have the mental fitness to hold the position.146 ORG37 amp38 ORG37 Pauses [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] Trial After Unexplained [PERSON]ness147 Drugmaker ORG37 amp38 ORG37 said [ORGANIZATION]2 it has paused the advanced clinical trial of its experimental coronavirus vaccine because of an unexplained illness in one of the volunteers.148 [ORGANIZATION]9, [ORGANIZATION] Police Chief Who Was Forced to Retire Over Wifes [ORGANIZATION] Post149 In a lengthy [ORGANIZATION] post, [ORGANIZATION]9 Police Chief [ORGANIZATION]4 wife defended him after being forced to resign over a [ORGANIZATION] post she wrote. The post confirmed that the police chief was being forced to resign for a post made by his wife on [ORGANIZATION] regarding President [LOCATION]0s visit to GPE20. She wrote that she would vote for [LOCATION]0 again because, You dont see him [LOCATION]0 meeting with [ORGANIZATION]6 family and speaking to him by phone.150 [ORGANIZATION], Pushed for Anonymity151 GPE21s mayor and police chief [ORGANIZATION]2 vowed to pursue and punish protesters who broke windows and threw flares into [ORGANIZATION], toppled statues of two celebrated GPE[PERSON] presidents and fired gunshots into a restaurant during a downtown riot [TIME]. But the culprits may prove difficult to identify let alone capture. After [ORGANIZATION] of demonstrations punctuated by violent clashes or vandalism, many of the citys most militant protesters remain largely elusive or unknown. Calls to action by often anonymous organizers spread rapidly among left-wing activists on social media and can come together in a matter of [LOCATION] Left-Wing Activists Post Online Guide to Destroying the Country if Election is Close153 A group of radical left-wing activists has posted an online guide about how to create civil unrest in GPE23 in the event that the [LOCATION] election is too close to call. The guide, Stopping the Coup, is being circulated by a group called [ORGANIZATION]0. It outlines a sinister plan for disruption as a response to an imagined coup by President [LOCATION]0.154 Man Charged With Assault After Farting in Uber155 The driver wasnt the only one hitting the gas  Fortunately the gass-enger admitted to assault occasioning actual harm on [PERSON] 30, which landed him a [ORGANIZATION]4 term, a 650 fine and [PERSON]0 [TIME] of community service  This isnt the first time someone has raised a stink over flatulence. In [ORGANIZATION]5, a GPE24 woman was arrested after assaulting her father because he farted too much in their shared home. Trust GPE24 to show and [STREET] in this race to the ahem bottom.156 [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]7 Has Every Article That Mentions His Name Delivered to His Inbox157 The pandemic panic promoter is loving the spotlight. Dr. [PERSON], the [ORGANIZATION] alarmist who has been a government bureaucrat for an astonishing 52 [DATE]9, is loving his time in the spotlight. The [ORGANIZATION]7 director of [ORGANIZATION]1 [ORGANIZATION]2 gets a [ORGANIZATION]8 email with every single news article that mentions his name, a Freedom of Information Act FOIA request emails has revealed Instead of educating [ORGANIZATION] with the latest facts and data related to the pandemic, [ORGANIZATION]7 appears to be spending his time booking media appearances, reading articles about himself, and using debunked models to continue to call for another shutdown of the entire country indefinitely. In [ORGANIZATION]7s latest panic pitch, he is now claiming that hundreds of thousands of [ORGANIZATION] will die from [ORGANIZATION] if the country does not follow his demands for massive restrictions, which include widespread lockdowns and mandatory masking.158 [LOCATION] [LOCATION]0 Reveals Son PERSON51 Tested Positive for [ORGANIZATION] But Had No Symptoms159 [ORGANIZATION]6 President [PERSON] [LOCATION]0s [ORGANIZATION]9 son PERSON51 also tested positive for [PERSON]-19 at one point but experienced no symptoms, First [PERSON] [LOCATION]0 has revealed, in a statement chronicling her experience with the coronavirus.

He returned a positive test at some point after that, [LOCATION] [LOCATION]0 revealed on [PERSON]1. Luckily he is a strong teenager and exhibited no symptoms, and has since tested negative, the first lady said.160 [ORGANIZATION]3 Exclusive Leaked [ORGANIZATION]4 Memo Incentivizes Anti-White Discrimination161 The capitalist embrace of explicitly anti-white policies is accelerating at [ORGANIZATION]4, which is also a prominent sponsor of [ORGANIZATION]5, An internal email provided to [ORGANIZATION]3 from the companys president [PERSON] titled [ORGANIZATION]6 Racial Diversity, Equity, and [ORGANIZATION] leads with a [ORGANIZATION]7 style narrative about the deaths of PERSON54, PERSON55 and PERSON56 that bares no resemblance to the facts on the ground. According to the memo, all employees at the company will be obligated to complete [ORGANIZATION] and anti-racist intervention training by [ORGANIZATION]. The multi-national has also designated a Diversity amp38 Inclusion Day that will focus on social justice, an initiative to increase donations to a variety of leftist groups, and a supply chain policy that racially privileges non-white vendors.162 ORG7 Publishes Photo of [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION] Sleeping With Crack Pipe in His Mouth163 A laptop originally sent for repair by [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION] but then never picked up was the source of a trove of photographs and emails published [PERSON]2 by the ORG7, among them are emails that show [PERSON] and PERSON58 [ORGANIZATION] did discuss the younger mans business interests, proving PERSON58 lied about knowing nothing about [PERSON]s business when speaking to reporters, and one photograph that appears to show [PERSON] asleep with a crack pipe in his mouth.164 GPE25 Begins Extortive Tyranny, [PERSON] for [ORGANIZATION] Violations165 If you disobey master PERSON59 and comrade [PERSON]0 [PERSON] in [DATE], you could be extorted for up to 150,000. The tyrannical rollout is here, and it is coming soon to another city near you. Brace yourself. This isnt going to stop in GPE27, it is only being rolled out there first. Many of the over 150,000 worth of fines to be extorted will come from religious groups dare to worship and gather as they please, which is a basic fundamental human right. The [DATE] government announced 62 summonses and over 150,000 in fines since [PERSON]3 during pandemic-related closures and restrictions, the city said in a [DATE]5 tweet. The penalties, which were levied by ORG50 agents in the [LOCATION], Orange and [ORGANIZATION] zones, included five issued to religious congregations, reported ORG51.

So terrible that [ORGANIZATION] and ORG56 took down the story of ORG57 emails related to Sleepy PERSON58 [ORGANIZATION] and his son, [PERSON], in the ORG7, [LOCATION]0 tweeted on [PERSON]1 [TIME].176 [ORGANIZATION], Economists Analysis Says177 Schools have not become super-spreaders of the coronavirus, according to an analysis by ORG58 economist PERSON71.

Can someone explain why it appears a [LOCATION]3 statue was toppled in GPE21, PERSON76 wrote [ORGANIZATION]2. Asking for a friend.180 Sen. PERSON79 New [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION] Report as Serious as Four Heart Attacks and a Stroke181 A ORG7 report involving newly unearthed emails between [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION] and an executive at [LOCATION] energy company [PERSON] is as serious as four heart attacks and a stroke, ORG61 member PERSON79, R-GPE34, told ORG62 [PERSON]1. The report states that the emails suggest the younger [ORGANIZATION] introduced his father, then-Vice President PERSON58 [ORGANIZATION], to the executive, PERSON80. If true, the report contradicts the Democratic nominees denial that he has ever spoken to [PERSON] about his overseas business dealings. Comment Senator PERSON79 R-La is one of the most quotable politicians in [PERSON] history. This is what he said when PERSON81 was found dead [PERSON]1 ornaments, drywall and PERSON81  name three things that dont hang themselves. Thats what the [PERSON] people thinkand they deserve some answers.182 Smoking-Gun Email Reveals How [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION] Introduced [LOCATION] Businessman to VP Dad183 [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION] introduced his father, then-Vice President PERSON58 [ORGANIZATION], to a top executive at a [LOCATION] energy firm less than [DATE]8 before the elder [ORGANIZATION] pressured government officials in [ORGANIZATION]4 into firing a prosecutor who was investigating the company, according to emails obtained by ORG63. The never-before-revealed meeting is mentioned in a message of appreciation that PERSON80, an adviser to the board of [PERSON], allegedly sent [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION] on [PERSON]2, about [DATE]8 after [PERSON] joined the [PERSON] board at a reported salary of up to 50,000 a month. Dear [PERSON], thank you for inviting me to GPE35 and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent sic some time together. Its realty sic an honor and pleasure, the email reads. An earlier email from [PERSON]4 also shows PERSON82, reportedly [PERSON]s No. 3 exec, asking [PERSON] for advice on how you could use your influence on the companys behalf.184 [ORGANIZATION] ORG65, ORG56 to [ORGANIZATION] left-wing media personalities have begun tagging the ORG56 accounts of social media platforms and begging them to take action against In [ORGANIZATION] livestreamer PERSON83, whose livestreams have garnered significant attention and positive feedback in [PERSON]5. A clip of PERSON84, who holds GPE23 First conservative political views, telling employees enforcing mask regulations to shut the fk up drew the ire of left-wing self-described comedians [ORGANIZATION] and PERSON86 on [ORGANIZATION]2.186 ORG67 Says Plant Was Targeted by Sabotage187 Back in [ORGANIZATION]5, ORG67 made public a strange allegation relating to its cybersecurity. The electric car company says that a [PERSON]n-speaking employee was offered 1 million dollars to insert malware into its network so certain nefarious actors could extract data. Instead of taking the bait, the employee  a worker at ORG67s Nevada Gigafactory  reported the scheme to ORG67, who asked the ORG69 to intervene. The ensuing trap involved the employee wearing a wire and extracting key info from the hacker, who was eventually arrested as he attempted to flee the country. Close call, right? Well, unfortunately ORG67 barely had a chance to exhale before reports surfaced that the company had been the target of another attempt at malicious sabotage  but this time it appears to have been an internal attempt. Legal establishments are still holding their collective breath over the possibility of hackers inducing potentially fatal software faults in electric vehiclesnot to mention driverless cars.

There have been so many of them that very few can now be remembered even those that were momentarily taken seriously by reputable observers, such as the idea that lawyer PERSON87 paying blackmail to PERSON88, constituted an illegal campaign donation.  This is [ORGANIZATION]-gathering and prosecution followed by almost the entire GPE[PERSON] media in respect of the president. This is the same refined school of jurisprudence exhibited by that well-known jurisconsult PERSON89 ORG51 when he declares that any reference by President [LOCATION]0 to the existence of any human beings of a different pigmentation to himself constitutes a racially charged statement. Nothing could be simpler [PERSON]7 has not gone by when the president has said or done something or failed to say or do something which must be assumed to be the cause of a real or apprehended unpleasant event.190 [LOCATION]0 I Was Right About Damaging Lockdowns191 During his first rally since swiftly defeating coronavirus, President [LOCATION]0 again slammed lockdown policies, and declared that he was right about resisting them all along, after ORG71 admitted that countries should not be using lockdowns as a [STREET] of controlling the virus.192 [LOCATION]0 [ORGANIZATION] Son-in-Law Cashing in On Coronavirus193 President [LOCATION]0 told a huge crowd in GPE20 [PERSON]6 that PERSON58 [ORGANIZATION]s family is cashing in on the coronavirus.

They trotted out hackneyed arguments, suggesting that some political norm had been broken by a Republican president nominating a judge to be confirmed as a justice by a Republican ORG75 in [ORGANIZATION]1. There have been 19 times where a seat became vacant in [ORGANIZATION]1 and both the presidency and ORG75 were controlled by the same party, resulting in 17 judicial confirmations. They suggested that PERSON93 wish to leave her seat open until a Democrat takes power represented a sort of binding legal commitment. And they fumed. They fumed that PERSON94 refuses to pledge fealty to their political priorities. They fumed that PERSON94 has stated that the role of the judiciary is not to achieve moral ends but to enforce the law. They fumed that PERSON94 had the temerity to state that courts are not designed to solve every problem or right every wrong in our public life, that the policy decisions and value judgments of government must be made by the political branches and that she has done her utmost to reach the result required by the law, whatever her preferences might be. Thats because, in the view of the political left, the [STREET] ought to be merely another weapon in its political arsenal.200 BAME People Are Over-Represented on TV Ethnic Minorities Make Up 22 of Actors and Presenters While Only Representing [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION] Ethnic minorities are overrepresented as actors and presenters on British television but continue to be sidelined off screen, new research suggests.

[LOCATION]60 writes in an article for The [PERSON] Conservative that conservative Poles and their [PERSON] allies have heard different versions of [LOCATION]61 statement many times and mostly from the [ORGANIZATION]6 [ORGANIZATION] lobby.

A trans woman would be an individual assigned male at birth, the definition has it. And when women assigned female at birth have anything remotely controversial, or simply undesired to say about the subject, they are often faced with extreme hostility. This process is what spawned the [ORGANIZATION] acronym, meaning, trans-exclusionary radical feminist, and some well-known public figures like celebrated author [LOCATION]63 have been labeled as such.

That means that, technically, any information about such a vaccine, whether positive or negative, claiming it to be either safe or unsafe, can be viewed as factual falsehood and ultimately, a conspiracy theory  since conspiracy theories are typically based on insufficient evidence, yet are promoted as self-evident truths. But ORG65 has announced that it will only clamp down on content that is negative or suspicious about some future vaccine. That means that if you were to make a video praising this non-existent thing and upload it to the platform, that would be fine  however unproven and unprovable at this moment.314 Rare Magnetism Found in the Worlds Strongest Material315 [PERSON], one of the worlds strongest materials, isnt normally magnetic. But when stacked and twisted, graphene develops a rare form of magnetism, new research finds. The magnetic field isnt created by the usual spin of electrons within the individual graphene layers, but instead arises from the collective swirling of electrons in all of the three-layers of the stacked graphene structure, researchers reported [DATE] [PERSON] in the journal [ORGANIZATION]44. [PERSON] is a material made of a single layer or monolayer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb pattern. Its incredibly light and strong though it is vulnerable to cracking. It also conducts electricity, making it exciting for use in electronics and sensors. Two dimensional i.e., single atomic thickness materials promise all sorts of unexpected properties.316 Room-Temperature Superconductivity in a Carbonaceous Sulfur Hydride317 One of the long-standing challenges in experimental physics is the observation of room-temperature superconductivity. Recently, high-temperature conventional superconductivity in hydrogen-rich materials has been reported in several systems under high pressure. An important discovery leading to room-temperature superconductivity is the pressure-driven disproportionation of hydrogen sulfide H2S to H3S, with a confirmed transition temperature of 203 kelvin at 155 gigapascals. It is important to distinguish between room temperature and high temperature superconductivity. High temperature superconductivity occurs well above absolute zero 0 K  273.15 C or 459.67 F in the relatively balmy reaches of liquid nitrogen 77K  195.79 C or 320 F. Actual room temperature superconductivity represents the holy grail of electrical transmission due to zero-loss conduction without the need for cryogenic refrigeration. As an example One [STREET] of improving high tension transmission of electricity would be to encase all long line wires in vacuum barrier housings. Much like a thermos bottle, these LN 2 filled casings would maintain low temperature conductivity and improve the electrical efficiency of existing grid transmission infrastructure. Elimination of these carrier losses is so vital that the expense could even be used to justify such technology. The complexity of installation and maintenance represent insurmountable support issues but the general concept still stands. Bearing that in mind, if economical155 gigapascal pressures 1 GPa  20,885,433.[DATE]8371 psf most likely were obtained using diamond anvil technologysuperconductivity were achievable at ambient pressures and temperatures, this would represent an advance comparable with sustained, payback-level fusion power generation. A coffee can-sized paddle wheel superconducting generator dipped into a stream outside your mountain cabin could run its stove, laundry, microwave oven, and refrigerator all at once. Although the foregoing example might be a slight exaggeration, it provides insight with respect to the possibilities opened up by room temperature superconducting motors. Electrically powered aircraft and long-haul freight trucks would be childs play. The ancient alchemical element of sulfur holds many other promises. Among them is black silicon which is capable of emitting and detecting light. This may be critical to intermediate technology optical computingas a stepping stone to fully light-based integrated circuits.318  [DATE]  [DATE]  3 424041  4 424101  5 424[PERSON]7  [DATE]  [DATE]  [DATE] 424055  [PERSON] [DATE][DATE]  16 424059  17 424[PERSON]9  18 424143  [DATE]  [DATE]  [DATE][DATE]  26 [DATE]  27 424115  [DATE]29 [DATE]  [DATE]33 424109  34 424081  [DATE][DATE]  [DATE]41 424019  42 424035  [DATE]  44 424137  [DATE]  47 [DATE]  [DATE][DATE] 424173  51 424163  [DATE]  [DATE]  [DATE]  58 424167  59 424099  [DATE]61 424217  62 424171  [DATE][DATE][DATE]73 [DATE]74 424[PERSON]1  75 [DATE]  76 424[PERSON]5  77 424043  [DATE] 424[PERSON]3  79 424105  [DATE]  [DATE]85 424030  [DATE]  95 [DATE]  96 424177  97 424189  [DATE]  [DATE]  [DATE]  102 [DATE]  [DATE]104 424187  105 424025  106 424021  107 rblacklistednewshKxa3JrtkK18Aj7simf-seizes-on-pandemic-to-pave-[STREET]-for-privatization-in-81.html  108 topheadline  109  110 topheadline  111  1[PERSON] topheadline  113  114 topheadline  115  116 topheadline  117  118 topheadline  119  [PERSON]0 topheadline  [PERSON]1  [PERSON]2 topheadline  [PERSON]3  [PERSON]4 topheadline  [PERSON]5  [PERSON]6 topheadline  [PERSON]7  [PERSON]8 topheadline  [PERSON]9  130 topheadline  131  132 topheadline  133  134 topheadline  135  136 topheadline  137  138 topheadline  139  140 topheadline  141  142 topheadline  143  144 topheadline  145  146 topheadline  147 rblacklistednewshKxa3pWSl0z4qJe8johnson-amp-johnson-pauses-covid19-vaccine-trial-after-unexplained.html  148 topheadline  149  150 topheadline  151  152 topheadline  153  154 topheadline  155  156 topheadline  157  158 topheadline  159  160 topheadline  161  162 topheadline  163  164 topheadline  165 rSHTFplan3tTasg8bMlusnyc-begins-extortive-tyranny-punishes-people-for-[DATE]-violations  166 topheadline  167  168 topheadline  169  170 topheadline  171  172 topheadline  173  174 topheadline  175  176 topheadline  177  1[DATE] topheadline  179  180 topheadline  181  182 topheadline  183  184 topheadline  185  186 topheadline  187  188 topheadline  189  190 topheadline  191  192 topheadline  193  194 topheadline  195  196 topheadline  197  198 topheadline  199  200 topheadline  201  202 topheadline  203  204 topheadline  205  206 topheadline  207  208 topheadline  209  210 topheadline  211  2[PERSON] topheadline  213  214 topheadline  215  216 topheadline  217 rblacklistednewshKxa3iFZ8F_jhFNkhow-uk-trackandtrace-data-from-restaurants-is-being-harvested-and.html  218 topheadline  219  220 topheadline  221  222 topheadline  223  224 topheadline  225  226 topheadline  227  228 topheadline  229  230 topheadline  231  232 topheadline  233  234 topheadline  235  236 topheadline  237  238 topheadline  239  240 topheadline  241  242 topheadline  243  244 topheadline  245  246 topheadline  247  248 topheadline  249  250 topheadline  251  252 topheadline  253  254 topheadline  255  256 topheadline  257  258 topheadline  259  260 topheadline  261  262 topheadline  263  264 topheadline  265  266 topheadline  267  268 topheadline  269  270 topheadline  271  272 topheadline  273  274 topheadline  275  276 topheadline  277  2[DATE] topheadline  279  280 topheadline  281  282 topheadline  283  284 topheadline  285  286 topheadline  287  288 topheadline  289  290 topheadline  291  292 topheadline  293  294 topheadline  295  296 topheadline  297  298 topheadline  299  300 topheadline  301  302 topheadline  303  304 topheadline  305  306 topheadline  307  308 topheadline  309  310 topheadline  311  3[PERSON] topheadline  313  314 topheadline  315  316 topheadline  317  318 topheadline"
portland,2019-03-20T00:00:00Z,Naked Capitalism,The Oregonian,"homeless, homelessness",What Republicans and Billionaires Really Mean When They Talk About 'Freedom',"PERSON0 Supreme [STREET] Justice [PERSON] codified the strategy for this initiative in the so-called [ORGANIZATION]. One of the most effective spokesmen for this libertarian program was [ORGANIZATION], whose bestseller Free to Choose became the foundation for a ten-part TV series. By PERSON4, atalk-show host1and author of more [ORGANIZATION] books in [ORGANIZATION]. He is a writing fellow at [ORGANIZATION]. Produced by [PERSON] is having a heated debate about the meaning of the word socialism. Wed be better served if, instead, we were debating the meaning of freedom. [ORGANIZATION] that fully 156,000 families are on the edge of homelessness in our small-population state. Every one of those households is now paying more than 50 percent of its DATE2 income on rent, and none of them has any savings one medical bill, major car repair or job loss, and theyre on the streets. While socialism may or may not solve their problem, the more pressing issue we have is an entire political party and a huge sector of the billionaire class who see homelessness not as a problem, but as a symptom of a free society. The words freedomand libertyare iconic in [LOCATION] cultureprobably more so than with any other nation because theyre so intrinsic to the literature, declarations and slogans of our nations founding. The ironyof the nation founded on the worlds greatest known genocide the systematic state murder of tens of millions of Native [LOCATION]s and [ORGANIZATION] of legalized slavery and [PERSON] of oppression and exploitation of the descendants of those slavesis extraordinary. It presses us all to bring truefreedom and liberty to all[LOCATION]s. But what do those words mean? If you ask the PERSON5 brothers and their buddieswho slap those words on pretty much everything they doyoud get a definition that largely has to do with being free from taxation and regulation. And, truth be told, if youre morbidly rich, that makes a certain amount of sense, particularly if your main goal is to get richer and richer, regardless of your behaviors impact on working-class people, the environment, or the ability of government to function. On the other hand, the definition of freedom and liberty thats been embraced by so-called democratic socialist [PERSON] to almost all of [ORGANIZATION] to [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] hear a definition thats closer to that articulated by [PERSON] when he proposed, in [PERSON], a second [PERSON] of Rights6 to be added to our Constitution. PERSON9s proposed amendments included the rightto a job, and the rightto be paid enough to live comfortably the rightto adequate food and clothing and recreation the rightto start a business and run it without worrying about unfair competition and domination by monopolies the rightof every family to a decent home the rightto adequate medical care to achieve and enjoy good health the rightto government-based protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment and the rightto a good education. [ORGANIZATION] pointed out that, All of these rights spell security. He added, GPE0s own rightful [STREET] in the world depends in large part upon how fully these and similar rights have been carried into practice for our citizens. For unless there is security here at home there cannot be lasting peace in the world. The other nations mentioned earlier took President [ORGANIZATION]s advice to heart. Progressive social democracy has kept [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], and the developed nations of LOC2 free of war for [ORGANIZATION] mind-boggling feat when considering the history of the developed world since [ORGANIZATION]. Just prior to PERSON9 winning FAC0 in the election of DATE8, the nation had been treated to DATE9 of a bizarre Republican administration that was the model for DATE10 ORG2. In DATE11, [PERSON]0 won the presidency on a campaign of more industry in government, less government in industryprivatize and deregulateand a promise to drop the top tax rate of 91 percent down to 25 percent. He kept both promises, putting the nation into a sugar-high spin called [PERSON], where the rich got fabulously rich and working-class people were being beaten and murdered by industrialists when they tried to unionize. [PERSON]1, [PERSON]2, and [PERSON]3 the three Republican presidents from DATE11 to DATE8 all cheered on the assaults, using phrases like the right to work to describe a union-free nation. In the end, the result of the horses and sparrows7 economics advocated by [PERSON]1 feed more oats to the horses and therell be more oats in the horse poop to fatten the sparrowsthat generations version of trickle-down economics was [ORGANIZATION] yes, they called it that until after World War II. Even though [ORGANIZATION] was fabulously popularthe only president to be elected four timesthe right-wingers of DATE14 were loud and outspoken in their protests of what they called socialist programs like [PERSON], the right to unionize, and government-guaranteed job programs including the [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION], ORG6, and others. The ORG7 and [LOCATION] Nazis were assembling by the hundreds of thousands nationwidenearly 30,000 in FAC1 aloneencouraged by wealthy and powerful economic royalists preaching freedom and [PERSON]. Like [ORGANIZATION], that generations huge and well-funded principally by the ORG8 chemical fortune organization was ORG9. [ORGANIZATION]s generation had seen the results of this kind of hard-right freedom rhetoric in GPE4, [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], the very nations with which we were then at war. Speaking of the grave dangers of rightist reaction in this ORG10, [ORGANIZATION] told GPE012in that same speech that If history were to repeat itself and we were to return to the so-called normalcy of the DATE11sthen it is certain that even though we shall have conquered our enemies on the battlefields abroad, we shall have yielded to the spirit of [ORGANIZATION] here at home. Although right-wingers are still working hard to disassemble PERSON9s New Dealthe ORG2 budget for [PERSON] contains massive cuts to [PERSON], as well as to [ORGANIZATION] and ORG13we got halfway toward his notion of freedom and liberty here in GPE7 not free if youre old and deep in poverty, so we have [PERSON] although the ORG2 wants to gut it. Youre not free if youre hungry, so we have food [PERSON] although the ORG2 wants to gut them. Youre not free if youre homeless, so we have housing assistance and homeless shelters although the ORG2 fights every effort to help homeless people. Youre not free if youre sick and cant get medical care, so we have [ORGANIZATION], ORG13, and [PERSON] although the ORG2 wants to gut them all. Youre not free if youre working [TIME] a week and still cant meet basic expenses, so we have minimum wage laws and the right to unionize although the ORG2 wants to gut both. Youre not free if you cant read, so we have free public schools although the ORG2 is actively working to gut them. Youre not free if you cant vote, so weve passed numerous laws to guarantee the right to vote although the ORG2 is doing everything it can to keep tens of millions of [LOCATION]s from voting.The billionaire class and their wholly owned Republican politicians keep trying to tell us that freedom means the government doesnt provide anyof the things listed above. Instead, they tell us as [PERSON]7 famously did13 in a ORG2 primary debate DATE16 that, if were broke and sick, were free to die like a feral dog in the gutter. Freedom is homelessness, in the minds of the billionaires who own the ORG2. Poverty, lack of education, no access to health care, poor-paying jobs, and barriers to voting are all proof of a free society, they tell us, which is why GPE0s lowest life expectancy, highest maternal and childhood death rates, lowest levels of education, and lowest pay are almost all in ORG2-controlled states14. GPE0particularly [PERSON] engaged in a debate right now about the meaning of socialism. It would be a big help for all of us if we were, instead, to have an honest debate about the meaning of the words freedomand liberty.

About PERSON20, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. ORG25 is the prime example, but tuition-free college and ORG26 also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism Because markets. I dont much care about the ism that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second PERSON21 saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I dont much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue  and this is why ORG25 is always first with me  is the tens of thousands of excess deaths from despair, as described by the [ORGANIZATION] study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes ORG25, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics  even the worthy fight to help the refugees PERSON22, PERSON23, and PERSON24 wars created  bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow  currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock [PERSON] campaigns, one by the ORG27, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the ORG28 and in the press  a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed lets call such voices the left. Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isnt allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize!

portland,2019-04-19T00:00:00Z,Naked Capitalism,The Oregonian,affordable housing,Making [ORGANIZATION],"[ORGANIZATION], a visual arts teacher in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]. Originally published at [ORGANIZATION], I sat in a cramped conference room in the large public high school where I teach in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]. I was listening to the principal deliver a scripted PowerPoint presentation on the 35-million-dollar budget deficit our district faces in [LOCATION]. Teachers and staff members slumped in chairs. A thick funk of disappointment, resignation, hopelessness, and simmering anger clung to us. After all, weve been here before. We know the drill expect layoffs, ballooning class sizes, diminished instructional time, and not enough resources. Accept that the teacher-student relationship  one that has the potential to be productive and sometimes even transformative  will become, at best, transactional. Bodies will be crammed into too-small spaces, resources will dwindle, and learning will suffer. These budgetary crises are by now cyclical and completely familiar. Yet the thought of weathering another of them is devastating. This is the third time in my DATE2-career as a visual arts teacher that weve faced the upheaval, disruption, and chaos of just such a budget crisis. In [LOCATION], the district experienced a massive shortfall that resulted in the firing of 344 teachers and bloated class sizes for those of us who were left. At one point, my Drawing I classroom studio  built to fit a maximum of 35 students  had more than 50 of them stuffed into it. We didnt have enough chairs, tables, or spaces to draw, so we worked in the halls. During DATE4 I taught six separate classes and was responsible for more than 250 students. Despite the pretense that real instruction was taking [STREET], teachers like me were largely engaged in crowd management and little more. All of the meaningful parts of the job  connecting with students, providing one-on-one support, helping struggling class members to make social and intellectual breakthroughs, not to speak of creating a healthy classroom community  simply fell by the wayside. I couldnt remember my students names, was unable to keep up with the usual grading and assessments were supposed to do, and was overwhelmed by stress and anxiety. Worst of all, I was unable to provide the emotional support I normally try to give my students. I couldnt listen because there wasnt time. On the [STREET] to work, I was paralyzed by dread on the [STREET] home, cowed by feelings of failure. The experience of [PERSON] was demoralizing and humiliating. My love for my students, my passion for the subjects I teach, and ultimately my professional identity were all stripped from me. And what was lost for the students? Quality instruction and adult mentorship, as well as access to vital resources  not to mention a loss of faith in one of [ORGANIZATION] supposedly bedrock institutions, the [INSTITUTION]. And keep in mind that whats happening in my school and in [PERSON]s schools more generally is anything but unique. According to ORG2, divestment2 in education is occurring in every single state in the nation, with 25 states spending less on education than they did before the recession of [ORGANIZATION]. The refusal of individual states to prioritize spending on education coupled with the [ORGANIZATION] administrations proposed3 7 billion in cuts to ORG3 are already beginning to make the situation in our nations public schools untenable  for both students and teachers. Sitting in that conference room, listening to my capable and dedicated boss describe our potential return to a distorted reality I remembered well made me recoil. Bracing myself for the soul-crushing grind of trying to convince students to buy into a system that will almost by definition fail to address, no less meet, their needs  to get them to show up [ORGANIZATION] even though there arent enough seats, supplies, or teachers to do the job  is an exercise in futility. The truth of the matter is that a society that refuses to adequately invest in the education of its children is refusing to invest in the future. Think of it as nihilism on a grand scale. Teachers as First Responders Schools are loud, vital, chaotic places, unlike any other public space in [ORGANIZATION]. Comprehensive public high schools reflect the socioeconomic, racial, religious, and cultural makeup of the population they serve. Each school has its own particular culture and ecosystem of rules, structures, core beliefs, and values. Each also has its own set of problems, specific to the population that walks through its doors [ORGANIZATION]. Coping with the complexity and magnitude of those problems makes the job of creating a thriving, equitable4, and productive space for learning something akin to magical thinking. The reflexive blame now regularly heaped on schools, teachers, and students in this country is a misrepresentation of reality. The real reason we are being left [PERSON] our global peers when it comes to student achievement has to do with so much more than the failure to perform well on standardized tests. Our kids are struggling not because weve forgotten how to teach them or theyve forgotten how to learn, but because the adults who run this society have largely decided that their collective future is not a priority. In reality, the tattered and rapidly deteriorating6 infrastructure of our national system of social services leaves schools and teachers as front-line first responders in what Id call a national crisis of the soul. So its no surprise to me that teachers, even in the reddest of states, have been walking out7 of their classrooms and demanding change. Such walkouts in [LOCATION], [PERSON], [PERSON], GPE6, GPE7, GPE8, GPE9, and [PERSON]0 have reflected grievances more all-encompassing than the pleas for higher pay that have made the headlines. And in so many states, they are still being paid less8 than a living wage. Demands for just compensation are symbolic and easy for the public to grasp. The higher pay won through some of those walkouts represents an acknowledgement that teachers are being asked to do a seemingly impossible job in a society whose priorities are increasingly out of whack, amid the crumbling infrastructure of the public-school system itself. idea that the real world is somehow separate from the world inside our schools and that issues of inequality, poverty, mental health, addiction, and racism wont impact the capacity of our students to [ORGANIZATION] academically sets a dangerous precedent for measuring success. Assuming that the student living in a car, not a home, should be able to stay awake during a lecture, that the one returning from [ORGANIZATION] in a psychiatric ward should be able to instantly tackle a difficult math test, and that the one whose undocumented father was just picked up by [ORGANIZATION] officers should have no problem concentrating as her teacher diagrams sentences in English is a grand delusion. In fact, among the many demands of teachers and their unions during the strikes of DATE9 were calls10 for more financial support for comprehensive social services for students. In [PERSON]1, teachers fought for legal support11 for students in danger of deportation. In GPE7, teachers are planning a new round of strikes that will, among other things, demand ORG5 coverage expansion12 aimed at improving student health. In [PERSON]2, teachers included a call for affordable housing13 in their negotiations and so drew attention to the importance of supporting students both in and out of the classroom. If schools are expected to pick up the slack for the gaping holes in our social safety net, it follows that they should be designed and funded with that purpose in mind. If teachers are supposed not only to teach but to act as counselors, therapists, and social workers, they should be paid salaries that reflect such weighty demands and should have access to resources that support such work. Why Prioritizing School Funding Matters There is a large disconnect14 between the lip service paid to supporting public schools and teachers and a visible reticence to adequately fund them. Ask almost anyone  save Secretary of [ORGANIZATION]  if they support teachers and schools and the answer is probably yes. Bring up the question of how to actually provide adequate financial support for education, however, and youll quickly find yourself mired in arguments about wasteful school spending, pension funds that drain resources, sub-par teachers, and bureaucratic bloat, as well as claims that you cant just continue to throw money at a problem, that money is not the solution. Id argue that money certainly is part of the solution. In a capitalist society, money represents value and power. In [ORGANIZATION], when you put money into something, you give it meaning. Students are more than capable of grasping that when school funding is being cut, its because we as a society have decided that investing in public education doesnt carry enough value or meaning. The prioritization16 of spending on the military, as well as the emphasis of the [ORGANIZATION] administration and congressional Republicans on a staggering tax cut17 for the rich, corporate tax evasion18, and the dismantling of whats left of the social safety net couldnt send a louder message about how much of a priority the wellbeing of the majority of this nations kids actually is. The [LOCATION]0 federal budget invested19 716 billion in national security, 686 billion of which has been earmarked for ORG7 with even more [PERSON] figures expected [LOCATION]1. Compare that to the 59.9 billion in discretionary appropriations for [ORGANIZATION] and the expected future cuts to its budget. Point made, no? However, since federal school contributions add up to only a small percentage of local and state education budgets, all blame cant go there. In [PERSON], for instance, [ORGANIZATION] placed on property taxes in [LOCATION]2 artificially limited such revenue, forcing the state to start relying heavily on income taxes to keep schools afloat. Corporations are an important source of income for states. Yet, though corporate profits in the [PERSON]3 rose by 69.3 billion to an all-time [PERSON] of more than two trillion dollars in [LOCATION]3, over [LOCATION]4 the states share of income-tax revenue has fallen to half what it was in [LOCATION]5. Take ORG9, whose worldwide headquarters are located only a few miles from the high school where I teach. It stands as a shining example23 of a corporation that has profited handsomely from sheltering income abroad24 while evading local tax responsibilities. ORG9 has a special relationship with the state of [PERSON], which taxes only the companys local profits, not those earned elsewhere. Adding insult to injury, according to The [PERSON]ian, by [LOCATION]6, ORG9 had put 12.2 billion of its earnings into offshore tax shelters25. Had that money been repatriated, the company could have owed up to 4.1 billion in [PERSON]3 taxes, which means it has a modest hand in the monetary shortfalls that leave schools like mine in desperate straits. In reality, [PERSON]s economy is thriving26 and yet how little it all matters, since here we are again on the precipice of another crisis. In [LOCATION]7, the state government formed a committee made up of educators, legislators, business leaders, and parents to create a reliable budgetary tool that would correlate school funding needs with student performance. This Quality ORG6 Model set out a standard for what a quality education would look like for every student in [PERSON]. In [LOCATION]8 since then, the state legislature has reliably failed to meet the funding goals set out by that model. [LOCATION]9, it calls for 10.7 billion in education spending, while the state legislatures joint ways and means committee recently released a budget27 that included spending of just 8.87 billion on the school system. Such DATE20 shortages of funds have, over time, helped create the present gaping hole in our public education system. And DATE21 that hole grows larger. [PERSON] in Our Nations Institutions Public schools represent one of the bedrock institutions of [ORGANIZATION]n democracy. Yet as a society weve stood aside as the very institutions that actually made [ORGANIZATION] great were gutted and undermined by short-term thinking, corporate greed, and unconscionable disrespect for our collective future. The truth is that there is money for education, for schools, for teachers, and for students. We just dont choose to prioritize education spending and so send a loud-and-clear message to students that education doesnt truly matter. And when you essentially defund education for DATE22, you leave kids with ever less faith28 in [ORGANIZATION]n institutions, which is a genuine tragedy. On DATE23, educators across the state of [PERSON] are planning to walk out of schools. The action, a precursor to a strike, is a direct response to the inadequate funding in the upcoming state budget and a referendum on the continuing divestment in public education. Teachers like me will be stepping out of our classrooms not because we dont want to teach, but because we do.

V8Vy5bg7wC6  [ORGANIZATION] DATE2 [PERSON] Peace Made Real8 To say that [ORGANIZATION] is reeling [ORGANIZATION] is a cosmic understatement.All of [ORGANIZATION]-left, right, center-was dealt a knockout blow by the indefatigable [ORGANIZATION] on [PERSON] when [ORGANIZATION] announced on [PERSON] the agreement between [ORGANIZATION] and the [ORGANIZATION] to immediately formalize full normalization of diplomatic, economic and all relations.The revelation was so surreal, in fact, that in this hopelessly gossipy nation, where everything leaks, nothing did. It was the equivalent of an atomic bomb. In terms of sheer force, not devastation. A good atomic bomb.For the [ORGANIZATION]s to engage openly, fully, and proudly has left this nation stunned. In the best [STREET]. It was totally unexpected.Perhaps it was best expressed in a tweet by former MK PERSON4, who wrote [ORGANIZATION]i Jews are keenly aware of their minority status in an Arab and [ORGANIZATION]ic region and so yearn for peace with the Arab and [ORGANIZATION]ic world. The [ORGANIZATION] showed [ORGANIZATION] yet again that when the Arab world comes to us with offers of genuine peace, they always find in us willing partners.Mired in an evergreen domestic political morass, [ORGANIZATION], the magician, has clearly worked for [ORGANIZATION]5 to pull off the impossible, as he was sliced and diced six ways to [PERSON] by local scandal and subterfuge.Full normalization.Peace, in the vernacular. With one of the most important, progressive, influential [PERSON]ern countries, the [ORGANIZATION].[ORGANIZATION]i media reports that this agreement has been brokered by [ORGANIZATION], ORG4 Chief [PERSON], and others. But foremost, [PERSON], ruler of the [ORGANIZATION], has boldly led [ORGANIZATION] into what will not just re-align the regions geopolitics, but quite likely those of the world. And, in a flash, the notoriously aggressive [ORGANIZATION]i media was rocked back on its heels, collective mouths agape, at the unsurpassed brilliance of [ORGANIZATION] were alive, he would have to reinvent his canon, which has become the literary foundation of Western story-telling. With [DATE], there simply is no Act V-no denouement. We are stuck in Act III, where the hero is unstoppable. Where his brilliance and unsurpassed triumphs continue, mere human frailties notwithstanding. On regional strategy, this shows the benefit of the [PERSON] standing by its historic allies in [ORGANIZATION]. Pres PERSON10 shunned [ORGANIZATION] amp38 the [PERSON] states and sought to normalize [ORGANIZATION]. His nuclear deal, an economic boon to GPE7, was a means to that end.  PERSON11 PERSON12 [ORGANIZATION] Taking normalization over annexation, [ORGANIZATION] poised to enter exalted company11 Unlike [ORGANIZATION]s two previous peace deals, the agreement announced [PERSON] with [PERSON] does not remove from the regional equation a direct neighbor with a history of involvement in wars intended to achieve our destruction. It does not feature a large, populous or especially militarily potent adversary.But its significance is profound nonetheless, and it was legitimate for Prime Minister [PERSON], detailing the agreement to [ORGANIZATION]is on [PERSON] [TIME], to add himself, at least in pencil, to the short list of [ORGANIZATION]i prime ministers who have widened [ORGANIZATION]s [STREET] of peace PERSON16 [LOCATION], [PERSON], PERSON17 DATE8, [PERSON]0, [ORGANIZATION] DATE9, [PERSON].Characteristically, the prime minister is trying to dance at two weddings.

Extending sovereignty to the 30 percent of [PERSON]2 allocated to [ORGANIZATION] under the [PERSON] administrations [PERSON]1 peace plan remains on the table, [ORGANIZATION] said. President [PERSON] had merely requested a temporary halt to the move as part of the [ORGANIZATION] deal, he added. There is no change in my plan [ORGANIZATION] the one who put it on the table I did not take sovereignty off the table, he repeated, with the aggrieved insistence of one who doth protest too much, methinks. [PERSON]1 President [PERSON] shakes hands with PERSON21 crown prince, [PERSON] PERSON18 [PERSON], in FAC0 in [PERSON]3, [PERSON]2. PERSON23, [ORGANIZATION] president himself rather punctured the contention, telling his own press briefing, when asked about [ORGANIZATION]s unilateral annexation plan, that [ORGANIZATION] has agreed not to do that. More than just off the table, theyve agreed not to do it, and I think that was very important and I think it was a great concession by [ORGANIZATION] This, before he and Ambassador to [ORGANIZATION] PERSONDATE84 returned to the specific formulation of the deal and stressed that the word suspend was the order of [PERSON]3. I cant talk about some time in the future, [PERSON] wound up saying.And, indeed, who can?But the bottom line is that annexation is off, and normalization is on.[ORGANIZATION] is naturally trying to mitigate the damage this simple equation does to his pro-settlement base. Yet the fact is that the prime minister had a choice  applying sovereignty to parts of Biblical [PERSON]4 and [PERSON]5 at the price of alienating [ORGANIZATION]s allies and empowering its enemies or jettisoning that unilateral gambit and working with the [PERSON]1 administration to bolster regional acceptance of the Jewish state.He chose the latter. And he should be commended for it.[ORGANIZATION] thanks [PERSON], [PERSON]6, [PERSON]7 for their support of [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] Prime Minister [PERSON] on [ORGANIZATION] thanked the leaders of [PERSON], [PERSON]6 and [PERSON]7 for their support of the agreement to normalize ties with the [ORGANIZATION].While [ORGANIZATION]i newspapers overwhelmingly welcomed the accord, Palestinian media condemned the triple aggression against Palestinian rights, referring to [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]8 and the deals broker, [PERSON]9.In [PERSON]2 city of [ORGANIZATION]1, protesters set ablaze posters of the leaders of the three countries.[ORGANIZATION], for his part, thanked Arab supporters of the normalization.I thank [PERSON]ian President PERSON26, and the governments of [PERSON]6 and [PERSON]7, for their support of the historic peace treaty between [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON], which is expanding the [STREET] of peace and will be good for the entire region, [ORGANIZATION] tweeted.[ORGANIZATION] has two official peace treaties with Arab states  [PERSON], since [LOCATION], and [PERSON]0, signed in DATE8.The [PERSON]1 administration launched a peace plan for [ORGANIZATION] in [PERSON]1 that would see the normalization of relations between [ORGANIZATION] and Arab states of the [PERSON].The [ORGANIZATION]i press said [PERSON]7 or [PERSON]6, but also [ORGANIZATION]2, could be next. PERSON27 says [ORGANIZATION]-[ORGANIZATION]3 normalization is an inevitability13 [PERSON]1 President [PERSON]s son-in-law and senior adviser [ORGANIZATION] said on [ORGANIZATION] that normalized ties between [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]3 were inevitable, following the [PERSON]1-brokered agreement between [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] [PERSON]3 before.Arab countries that are friendly to [ORGANIZATION] welcomed the historic accord, but regional power [ORGANIZATION]3 has remained conspicuously silent following its announcement.[ORGANIZATION]3, like [ORGANIZATION] and the [ORGANIZATION], shares [ORGANIZATION] as a common foe and maintains close ties to [PERSON]3.PERSON27, who reportedly played a role in brokering the [ORGANIZATION]-[ORGANIZATION] agreement, said in an interview with [ORGANIZATION] on [ORGANIZATION] that [ORGANIZATION]3s younger generation admired [ORGANIZATION] and sought ties with the Jewish state.They see [ORGANIZATION] as almost the LOC2 of [ORGANIZATION] and they want to be connected to it as a trading partner, as a technology partner, as a security partner, PERSON27 said of young Saudis.The older generations, he said, were still stuck in conflicts of the past, and despite the countrys recent efforts toward modernization, you cant turn around a battleship [TIME].Despite the opposition from some of the older generation, PERSON27 predicted that [PERSON]s landmark deal would serve as a catalyst for opening ties between [ORGANIZATION] and other Arab states, including [ORGANIZATION]3. PERSONDATE84 PERSON29 Helped [PERSON] Peace Deal Only by Being So Hostile14 [PERSON] Ambassador to [ORGANIZATION] PERSONDATE84 told ORG6 on [ORGANIZATION] [TIME] that former Vice President PERSON29 had contributed to the peace deal between [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION] only by being so hostile.The deal, known as the Abraham Accord, was announced by President [PERSON] in [ORGANIZATION] on [PERSON] [TIME] and provides for full normalization for the first time between [ORGANIZATION] and a [PERSON] Arab state. It is expected to lead to similar deals with other Arab states.Even liberal critics of President [PERSON] praised his huge achievement, calling the deal a breakthrough and an earthquake.[ORGANIZATION]0 rushed to take some of the credit The coming together of [ORGANIZATION] and Arab states builds on the efforts of multiple administrations to foster a broader Arab-[ORGANIZATION]i opening, including the efforts of the PERSON10-[ORGANIZATION]0 administration to build on the Arab Peace Initiative. I personally spent time with leaders of both [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] during our administration building the case for cooperation and broader engagement and the benefits it could deliver to both nations, and I am gratified by [ORGANIZATION]s announcement.However, [ORGANIZATION]1 said, if [ORGANIZATION]0 deserved credit, it was only because the PERSON10-[ORGANIZATION]0 administration was so hostile to both [ORGANIZATION] and the [ORGANIZATION] that they realized they had to work together.I think the credit that he [ORGANIZATION]0 deserves is he was  they were so bad and so hostile to both [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]8 that it caused both of them to commiserate a little bit, which was something that we were able to take advantage of when the president [PERSON] took office, [ORGANIZATION]1 said.So, to that extent, I think the PERSON10 policy was so terrible that it probably created more of a commonality of interest between [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]8.The [ORGANIZATION] nuclear deal, in particular, which was enthusiastically pushed by the PERSON10-[ORGANIZATION]0 administration, was a threat to both [ORGANIZATION] and the [ORGANIZATION]. EXCL[PERSON]1IVE I interviewed [ORGANIZATION] the Minister of ORG7 for ORG8 of the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]2. This was [DATE] ever interview of an [ORGANIZATION] official with an [ORGANIZATION]i reporter. We spoke about normalization and annexation. All the details soon on axios16. Here is a taste pic.twitter .com5ansnPIFcT17  [ORGANIZATION]3 [ORGANIZATION]7, DATE918 Normalization with other Arab countries is possible, says [ORGANIZATION]4 Normalization between [ORGANIZATION] and additional Arab countries is possible, [ORGANIZATION]5, FAC0 special representative for international negotiations told [PERSON]0.[ORGANIZATION]6 said that he prefers not to name those countries for now.One of the things were proud of is the fact that the entire negotiation between [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON], didnt leak prior to the president announcing it, he said. And so, while obviously now speculation is going to abound, I would like to try my best to sort of allow the negotiations to take their time and not rush it.[ORGANIZATION]6, who is part of [ORGANIZATION]s peace team, replaced [ORGANIZATION]8 as [PERSON] envoy [PERSON]7. He noted that the [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]6 and [PERSON]7 - all participated in the [PERSON] administrations rollout of the peace for prosperity in [PERSON]1 at FAC0, but added that there are other countries that have reached out to us. And weve had extremely positive conversations with them.But peace agreements are extraordinarily difficult, and progress can happen quickly, but it can also happen slowly, he continued. We want to take the time that it is necessary to work through the details and to make sure that we can accomplish a real historic achievement with another country. These things are extremely complex negotiations with numerous discussions constantly ongoing, and so Id really like to allow them to have the space and time.[ORGANIZATION]6 weighed in on negotiations during a pandemic and said that travel has been difficult. GPEDATE84 to [ORGANIZATION] Four ways you will benefit from peace with [ORGANIZATION]20 PERSON21 Crown Prince PERSON18s decision to normalize ties with [ORGANIZATION] was well calculated - a move that was made with the understanding that the technology, geopolitical and religious rewards would far outweigh any risks.This is the first [ORGANIZATION] peace treaty in [PERSON]8, but it is not unprecedented for a Muslim-majority country and [ORGANIZATION] to enjoy strategic ties. Muslim-majority GPEDATE84 and [ORGANIZATION] established diplomatic ties in [PERSON]9 that have been developing ever since.Normalization between [ORGANIZATION] and the [ORGANIZATION] is a historic step towards a future of peace, prosperity and hope, wrote PERSON40, [ORGANIZATION]i ambassador to GPEDATE84 on [PERSON]2 on [ORGANIZATION]. For DATE20, GPEDATE84 has been a model to other Muslim-majority countries, showing what could be achieved through partnership amp38 friendship with [ORGANIZATION].Similarly, wrote PERSON41, as we celebrate [ORGANIZATION]-[ORGANIZATION] normalization, remember GPEDATE84 was a pioneer in its friendship with [ORGANIZATION]. It is an example of what is possible between Muslim-majority countries and [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON]3 open relations helped ease the acceptance of [ORGANIZATION] in the wider Muslim world.[ORGANIZATION] locals hail [ORGANIZATION] peace, offer hotel discounts elsewhere in [PERSON], wariness21 DATE21 after the bombshell announcement that the [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] have agreed to establish full normalized relations, [ORGANIZATION]s TV news shows DATE22 [TIME] featured interviews with [ORGANIZATION] ministers, locals, [ORGANIZATION]i expats, and even a hotel reservations clerk offering 40 discounts to [ORGANIZATION]i tourists.All of us in the [ORGANIZATION] are celebrating this agreement, welcoming it and encouraging other states to establish agreements like it, an unnamed driver in [ORGANIZATION]7 enthused in [PERSON]4 news broadcast. We are happy about this decision by [PERSON] PERSON18 and we support him for anything with [ORGANIZATION], said a local, PERSON42.Rival [PERSON]5, whose correspondent had already made his [STREET] to [ORGANIZATION]7, interviewed an [ORGANIZATION]i-born businessman named PERSON43 who proclaimed the newly announced establishment of ties to be absolutely amazing. PERSON43s [ORGANIZATION]-born friend PERSON45 weighed in, in Hebrew, to say that I started learning Hebrew a while back.Telephoning a [ORGANIZATION]7 hotel, [PERSON]6 found a delighted reservations clerk, who said, Everybody is exited about the peace with [ORGANIZATION]. And I will be very much looking forward if you come to stay with us. We would be happy to give you a 40 discount from the room rate.Hebrew TV outlets also screened short clips from several pro-[ORGANIZATION] bloggers in [PERSON]8, one of whom wished the countries mazaltov on the new ties. PERSON46 [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]8, PERSON47, PERSON48 united in criticism of [ORGANIZATION]-[ORGANIZATION] deal22 In the [PERSON]1, PERSON49 and [LOCATION]woman [ORGANIZATION] PERSON48 D-MI were some of the only high-profile voices that appeared critical of the peaceful connection. PERSON49 was a standout as one of those who amplified criticism by downplaying the deal.This agreement enshrines what has been the emerging status quo in the region for a long time including the total exclusion of Palestinians, wrote PERSON49. Dressed up as an DATE23 achievement from two leaders who want [PERSON] to win. The election is DATE24 away. PERSON49 also retreated another criticism of the deal which noted it could lead to drone sales.PERSON48 was harsher, saying she wouldnt celebrate [ORGANIZATION] for stealing land he already controls and slamming devastating apartheid. [PERSON]1 Ambassador to [ORGANIZATION] PERSONDATE84 said PERSON49 was wrong about how easy the deal was and noted it had not been accomplished during the previous administration.PERSON49 is a frequent critic of both [ORGANIZATION] and the [ORGANIZATION]. On DATEDATE84 he compared [ORGANIZATION] to authoritarian regimes such as [ORGANIZATION]9, [ORGANIZATION]8, [PERSON], [PERSON] and GPE31. He frequently calls [ORGANIZATION]s leadership racist.In [PERSON]1 he compared [ORGANIZATION] to other countries such as [ORGANIZATION]3, GPE32, [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]9 and said in [DATE] that the [PERSON]1 was outsourcing policy in [LOCATION] to [ORGANIZATION]3 and the [ORGANIZATION]. He tweeted in DATE27 about the depth of corruption of [PERSON]1 policy in [ORGANIZATION] due to Saudi[ORGANIZATION] efforts.He constantly slams the [ORGANIZATION] over paid speaking opportunities and influencing [PERSON]1 policy, as well as harming the [ORGANIZATION] deal. A search of PERSON49 tweets show he rarely critiqued [ORGANIZATION], reserving his criticism for the [ORGANIZATION].[ORGANIZATION]s [ORGANIZATION]7 network was also at the forefront of attacking the [ORGANIZATION] deal. It ran a story on how its ally [ORGANIZATION]8 might suspend ties with the [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]8 also has relations with [ORGANIZATION]. It also ran two op-eds attacking the deal as cementing [ORGANIZATION]s war on the Palestinians. It claimed Palestinians unanimously rejected the deal. [ORGANIZATION]1, [ORGANIZATION]2, [ORGANIZATION]3 all praise the [PERSON] Administrations historic [ORGANIZATION]-[ORGANIZATION] dealTheres no question that its good newsA big deal [URL]TmFWPi6N8K23  [ORGANIZATION]4 [ORGANIZATION]5 [DATE], DATE924Thomas L. [ORGANIZATION]1 A Geopolitical Earthquake Just Hit the [ORGANIZATION]DATE84 The big geopolitical losers are [ORGANIZATION] and all of its proxies [PERSON]7, the [LOCATION]i militias, [PERSON]1n President [ORGANIZATION]7, [PERSON]8, [ORGANIZATION]ic Jihad, the [ORGANIZATION]4 in [LOCATION] and [ORGANIZATION]8. This is for a number of reasons. Up to now, [LOCATION] has kept up a delicate balance between [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], not looking to provoke [ORGANIZATION], and dealing with [ORGANIZATION] covertly.But this deal is right in [ORGANIZATION]s face. The tacit message is We now have [ORGANIZATION] on our side, so dont mess with us. The vast damage [ORGANIZATION] inflicted on [ORGANIZATION] through apparent cyberwarfare in DATE29 may have even given the GPE37 more breathing room to do this deal.But there is another message, deeper, more psychological. This was the GPE37 telling the [ORGANIZATION]ians and all their proxies There are really two coalitions in the region [ORGANIZATION]  those who want to let the future bury the past and those who want to let the past keep burying the future. The GPE37 is taking the helm of the first, and it is leaving [ORGANIZATION] to be the leader of the second.When the [PERSON] administration assassinated [ORGANIZATION]8, the head of [ORGANIZATION]s [ORGANIZATION], the foreign-operations branch of the [ORGANIZATION]ic Revolutionary Guards Corps in [PERSON]1, I wrote a column saying that GPE38 had just killed the dumbest man in [ORGANIZATION].Why? Because what was [ORGANIZATION]9 business model, which became Shiite [ORGANIZATION]s business model? It was to hire Arab and other Shiites to fight Arab Sunnis in [LOCATION], [PERSON]0, [LOCATION] and [PERSON]1  to project [ORGANIZATION]s power. And what was the result of all this? [ORGANIZATION] has helped to turn all four into failed states. [ORGANIZATION]s clerical leadership has become the largest facilitator of state failure in [ORGANIZATION]  including its own  which is why so many Lebanese blame it and [PERSON]7 for their countrys mismanagement that led to the devastating explosion [ORGANIZATION]0 in [PERSON]2 [INSTITUTION].I have followed [ORGANIZATION] for too long to ever write the sentence the region will never be the same again. The forces of sectarianism, tribalism, corruption and anti-pluralism run deep there. But there are other currents  young men and women who are just so tired of the old game, the old fights, the old wounds being stoked over and over again. You could see them demonstrating all over the streets of [PERSON]3 [ORGANIZATION]0 demanding good governance and a chance to realize their full potential.The GPE37 and [ORGANIZATION] and the [PERSON] on [PERSON] showed  at least for one brief shining moment  that the past does not always have to bury the future, that the haters and dividers dont always have to win.It was a breath of fresh air. [LOCATION] it [ORGANIZATION]1 soon turn into a howling wind of change that spreads across the whole region. Wow.Here is an Arab [ORGANIZATION]ic Quran scholar from the [ORGANIZATION] using his 1.6m follower count to publicly defend a Jewish [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]i, for protecting the [ORGANIZATION] flag. Take heart. Peace is coming   [PERSON]0 [DATE], DATE927 [PERSON]1 [ORGANIZATION] about [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]828 Third, an unhealthy combination of [ORGANIZATION]i land withdrawals and [PERSON]4 . subsidies drove the diplomacy of prior agreements ignoring the [PERSON]0 deal, which was not implemented. To one extent or another, the deals amounted to grand bribes Recognize [ORGANIZATION] and the [PERSON]s will reward you. Naturally, the bribees disliked this arrangement its only human to resent taking adverse steps for the money. [PERSON]3 did not impose the pacts, but critics convincingly claimed it did. A flawed basis caused the agreements either to turn out badly the cold peace with [PERSON] and [PERSON]0 or to fail completely the ORGDATE84 continued rejectionism.In contrast, the [ORGANIZATION]-[ORGANIZATION]-[PERSON] statement has a legitimate basis, with no hint of bribery [ORGANIZATION]i forces retreat from no territory and [PERSON] taxpayers cough up no money. The statement has a sound premise [PERSON]5 gives up a widely condemned and counterproductive symbolic step in return for acceptance by an emerging regional power.Yes, the agreement contains lofty language about charting a new path that will unlock the great potential in the region and transforming the region by spurring economic growth, enhancing technological innovation, and forging closer people-to-people relations. Yes, the words [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]8, and [ORGANIZATION]ism are not overtly mentioned by name, but everyone knows those are the threats. The joint statement relies not on a bribe but on a classic, if implicit, pact of mutual benefit. It also further opens the [PERSON] arsenal to [PERSON]8.One of those predictable Palestinian howls of treason.For these reasons, this skeptic of prior [ORGANIZATION]-Arab agreements is now uncharacteristically hopeful admittedly, a career-threatening move for a [PERSON] hand. The [ORGANIZATION]-[ORGANIZATION] statement helps ORG27, enjoys widespread support, meets with limited domestic opposition, has a sound, non-bribery basis, and contains positive features crucial to both parties. If my unwonted optimism is correct, Arab-[ORGANIZATION]i relations just might begin to exit from the sterile futility of [ORGANIZATION]3.Dem ORG28 [PERSON] on Historic [ORGANIZATION]-GPE37 Peace Deal29 Democratic ORG28 hopefuls are remaining silent about the [PERSON] administrations [PERSON] announcement that it had brokered a historic peace agreement between [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON], an indication of the manner in which the issue has split progressive and mainstream Democrats.Nearly all of [ORGANIZATION] top Democratic ORG28 challengers avoided making public statements about the agreement, which formally normalizes relations between the Arab nation and [ORGANIZATION]. The GPE37 is the first [PERSON] Arab nation to increase its relations with [ORGANIZATION], a move that sent shockwaves through the region and sparked anger from Palestinian leaders.In [PERSON]9, the announcement was met with ambivalence by former PERSON10 administration officials and outright hostility from [ORGANIZATION]s top critics in [LOCATION]. Rep. [ORGANIZATION] PERSON48 D., [PERSON]6, a frequent [ORGANIZATION] critic who has been accused of spreading anti-Semitic rhetoric, said she wont be fooled by an agreement that she described as a sweetheart business deal.The announcement puts Democrats in a tricky political position While mainstream Democrats have advocated regional peace with [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION]5, they are hesitant to give President [PERSON] a win. Since [PERSON] assumed office, [ORGANIZATION]0 has argued that he is an irritant to global security. Yet the historic peace agreement between [ORGANIZATION] and the GPE37 shows that, behind the scenes, the administration has been working to broker an accord that will ultimately increase stability in [ORGANIZATION].Among candidates for seats in states expected to determine ORG28 control [ORGANIZATION]6, only Arizonas Mark [PERSON]2 has addressed the agreement, calling it an important, positive step forward for our ally, [ORGANIZATION], and for lasting peace in the region. Democratic ORG28 nominees in [PERSON]7, [PERSON]8, [PERSON]9, [PERSON]0, and [PERSON]1 have yet to acknowledge the deal following President [PERSON]s [PERSON]-[TIME] announcement. None of the candidates responded to requests for comment from the [PERSON]3 Free Beacon.[PERSON]3 Reactions To [ORGANIZATION]-[ORGANIZATION] Normalization Agreement Senior Saudi Journalist Praises It, [ORGANIZATION]i Press Vehemently Attacks It 30 The announcement of a normalization agreement between [ORGANIZATION] and the [ORGANIZATION], in advance of the signing of an [ORGANIZATION]-[ORGANIZATION] peace agreement, sparked many reactions across the Arab world. Senior Saudi journalist [PERSON]4 wrote in his [ORGANIZATION]7 column in the [PERSON]2-based Saudi [DATE] [ORGANIZATION]2 that the agreement was an historic diplomatic achievement and compared it to the peace agreements with [ORGANIZATION] by [PERSON]ian president [PERSON]5 and [PERSON]0s King [PERSON]6. In contrast, the [ORGANIZATION]i press, as expected, vehemently attacked the agreement, including with invective against the [ORGANIZATION] and accusations that it had betrayed and sold out the Palestinian cause and gotten nothing in return. [ORGANIZATION]i journalists also tweeted messages attacking it and [ORGANIZATION] leader [PERSON]3 Crown Prince [PERSON]7 personally, calling him a liar and the Satan of the Arabs, and claiming that with this agreement he had left the fold of [ORGANIZATION]. Some even called on the Arab countries to boycott the [ORGANIZATION] and recall their ambassadors from it.The following are translations of [PERSON]8 column praising the agreement and [ORGANIZATION]i attacks on it.Saudi Journalist The [ORGANIZATION]-[ORGANIZATION] Agreement Is A Breakthrough That Will Benefit The Arabs And [PERSON] his [ORGANIZATION]7, DATE9 column in the [PERSON]2-based Saudi [DATE] [ORGANIZATION]2, [PERSON]4 wrote To put it directly and clearly, the [ORGANIZATION] achieved a great political, psychological and security breakthrough in [ORGANIZATION] when the historic agreement with [ORGANIZATION] was announced. This agreement does not disregard the justified right of the Palestinians to establish their state and protect the [ORGANIZATION]ic holy places for all Muslims. Rather, it provides a feasible opportunity to implement the two-state solution in practice.The [ORGANIZATION] has made a tangible achievement on the Palestinian front  through action, not slogans  by stopping the erosion of the Palestinian lands in [PERSON]2 in favor of [ORGANIZATION]i settlements, an issue that was explicitly stated in the tripartite announcement by the [ORGANIZATION], the [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]8, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] and all the rest of the big talkers, and obviously also the organizations of chaos, such as [ORGANIZATION]3, [PERSON], the [ORGANIZATION]4 and [ORGANIZATION]5, will continue operating their word-mill against the [ORGANIZATION], for this word-mill never stopped churning out invective and against this noble, strong and tranquil Arab country [PERSON]s historic leader, president [PERSON]5, was attacked when he protected his country from a dire fate and from the loss of its territories by signing the FAC2 Accords. He was a true hero of war and of peace, for [PERSON] still enjoys the benefits of the peace he made with [ORGANIZATION]. Later, the great [PERSON]0ian king, [PERSON]6 [PERSON], was attacked when he refused to succumb to the market of populist slogans and brought his country peace while also restoring its territories as part of the famous [LOCATION] peace agreement. Being a realistic and responsible Arab leader, [PERSON]ian President PERSON70 welcomed the agreement between the [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], achieved under the aegis of the [PERSON] and its president [PERSON]. The absurd thing is that the propaganda machine of [ORGANIZATION]6, [ORGANIZATION]8 and [ORGANIZATION] is shooting its arrows at the [ORGANIZATION], while [ORGANIZATION]8s trade, military and tourism relations with [ORGANIZATION] continue unabated. [ORGANIZATION], the shop where [ORGANIZATION]7 hocks its wares, is also friendly with [ORGANIZATION]8 and coordinates with it! PERSON71 Saudi, [ORGANIZATION] analysts Palestinians will benefit from accord31 PERSON72, a prominent Saudi academic and researcher, defended the normalization agreement between [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] on DATE22, saying it pulled the rug from under the feet of [ORGANIZATION]8 and [ORGANIZATION] and turned the Palestinians into the biggest winners.In an article published in the [ORGANIZATION]9 online newspaper, [PERSON] wrote that the agreement was not a blank check, but rather the goal was to protect the rights of the Palestinian people who have been abandoned by [PERSON]8 and thrown into the arms of [ORGANIZATION].The [ORGANIZATION] is sovereign and has the right to do what its political and security interests dictate, [PERSON] argued. It initiated this agreement after 72 [ORGANIZATION]5 of the Arab-[ORGANIZATION]i conflict to protect [ORGANIZATION]ic sanctities. One of the conditions of the agreement is to allow Muslims around the world to pray at the blessed FAC1.The Saudi academic noted that the [ORGANIZATION]-[ORGANIZATION] deal was not the first of its kind. It was preceded by several agreements such as the [ORGANIZATION]-[PERSON] FAC2 agreement, the [PERSON]0 Madrid Peace Conference, the [DATE] [ORGANIZATION] between the ORG40 and [ORGANIZATION] that resulted in the establishment of ORG27, as well as the DATE8 [LOCATION] Agreement between [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]0, [PERSON] pointed out.The [ORGANIZATION], he added, is trying to put an end to the era of denunciation and condemnation by taking this step to serve the defenseless Palestinian people. It threw the ball into the [STREET] of the Palestinians, who must now seize the opportunity and abandon the policy of lip service.[ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] made huge mistake with [ORGANIZATION] deal, and now faces dangerous future32 [LOCATION] [ORGANIZATION]4 made a huge mistake by taking steps toward normalization with [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]s President PERSON74 said in a televised speech on [PERSON] its part, [ORGANIZATION]s powerful [ORGANIZATION]ic [ORGANIZATION] vowed there would be dangerous consequences for the [ORGANIZATION], and that the deal was accelerate [ORGANIZATION]s demise. The [ORGANIZATION], designated a terrorist organization by the [PERSON]1, called the deal a shameful agreement and an evil action that was underwritten by the [PERSON]1, and said it would bring a dangerous future for the [ORGANIZATION] government.PERSON75 additionally warned the [ORGANIZATION] against allowing [ORGANIZATION] to have a foothold in the region, the [LOCATION] news agency reported.The [ORGANIZATION] better be mindful. They have committed a huge mistake, a treacherous act. We hope they will realize this and abandon this wrong path, PERSON75 said.[ORGANIZATION] has historically been the protector of its neighbors and ensurer of the security of the Persian [PERSON], PERSON75 said, noting [PERSON]8 apparently thought the agreement could help guarantee security. PERSON76 [ORGANIZATION] betrayed [ORGANIZATION], did [PERSON] a personal favor, with [ORGANIZATION] deal33 [PERSON]7 chief [PERSON] PERSON76 warned [ORGANIZATION] on [ORGANIZATION] that his organization intended to carry out a game changing revenge attack for the death of one of its fighters in an airstrike [PERSON]1 that was widely attributed to [ORGANIZATION].He also called the new [ORGANIZATION]-[ORGANIZATION] normalization deal a betrayal of [ORGANIZATION], and said the [ORGANIZATION] had given a personal electoral favor to [PERSON]1 President [PERSON].[ORGANIZATION] had been on high alert along the northern border, but slightly reduced its troop presence following the deadly explosions that rocked [PERSON]3 [ORGANIZATION]0, killing some 200 people, injuring thousands, and leaving nearly a third of a million people homeless.Everything that happened since [PERSON]2 until [ORGANIZATION], the high alert of the [ORGANIZATION]i military and more is our punishment to [ORGANIZATION], PERSON76 said in a televised speech commemorating the anniversary of [DATE] bloody [PERSON]3 conflict between [ORGANIZATION] and the [ORGANIZATION]-backed terror group. If you kill us, you need to wait across the border for the reaction. This is a decision that is still in force, nothing has changed it is just a question of time.PERSON76 warned that [PERSON]7s reaction will redefine the rules of the game along the border, adding that only a considered, serious reaction, not some public relations stunt, can do this.In his speech, which came [TIME] after he was reported to have met with visiting [ORGANIZATION]ian Foreign Minister PERSON78, PERSON76 also condemned the normalization agreement announced [PERSON] between [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON].This is a betrayal of [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], it is a betrayal of [PERSON]5, of the Palestinian people, PERSON76 said. [ORGANIZATION]s president says [ORGANIZATION]4 made huge mistake in [ORGANIZATION] deal34 [LOCATION] [ORGANIZATION]4 has made a huge mistake in reaching a deal toward normalizing ties with [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]s President PERSON74 said on DATE22 in a speech furiously condemning what he called a betrayal by the [PERSON] state.The [ORGANIZATION]ian hardline [DATE] PERSON79, whose editor-in-chief is appointed by [ORGANIZATION] Leader [DATE]0, said the [ORGANIZATION] has turned itself into a legitimate target for the resistance, according to its website.The [ORGANIZATION]-[ORGANIZATION] agreement announced on [PERSON], which [PERSON] President [PERSON] helped to broker, is seen as aimed at bolstering opposition to regional power [ORGANIZATION].In his televised speech, PERSON75 warned the [ORGANIZATION] against allowing [ORGANIZATION] a foothold in the region.They the [ORGANIZATION] better be mindful. They have committed a huge mistake, a treacherous act. We hope they will realize this and abandon this wrong path, PERSON75 said without elaborating.In a front-page comment, the newspaper PERSON79 said The [ORGANIZATION]s great betrayal of the Palestinian people ..., will turn this small, rich country which is heavily dependent on security into a legitimate and easy target for the resistance.[ORGANIZATION] often refers to militant forces and regional countries opposed to [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]9 as a resistance front.[DATE]1 [ORGANIZATION]8 may suspend ties with [ORGANIZATION] over [ORGANIZATION] deal35 President [PERSON] [DATE]1 said on [ORGANIZATION] that [ORGANIZATION]8 was considering closing its embassy in [PERSON]3 and suspending diplomatic ties with [PERSON] over its accord to normalize ties with [ORGANIZATION].[DATE]1 was speaking to reporters in [PERSON]5 after ORG45 said history will never forgive the hypocritical behavior of the [ORGANIZATION] in agreeing such a deal.[PERSON] said the Palestinian people and administration were right to react strongly against the agreement, which recasts the order of [PERSON] politics from the Palestinian issue to the fight against [ORGANIZATION].History and the conscience of the regions peoples will not forget and never forgive this hypocritical behavior of the [ORGANIZATION], betraying the Palestinian cause for the sake of its narrow interests, the ministry said in a statement.It is extremely worrying that the [ORGANIZATION] should, with a unilateral action, try and do away with the [PERSON]4 Arab Peace Plan developed by ORG47. It is not in the slightest credible that this three-[STREET] declaration should be presented as supporting the Palestinian cause. Where [PERSON]6 FM [DATE]3 just reveals it was never pursuing peace he was motivated by, but sheer hatred against [ORGANIZATION]37. The peace deal with [ORGANIZATION]38 should be great source of celebration ... but seemingly not for this bitter little man.

While [PERSON]8 has been proscribed as a terrorist organization by [PERSON]9, [ORGANIZATION]5 and [ORGANIZATION]6 and has had its armed wing banned in the [ORGANIZATION]7, [ORGANIZATION]8 argues that it is a legitimate organization that was democratically elected, in reference to the [PERSON]3 Palestinian legislative elections and violent removal of [ORGANIZATION]4 members from the [PERSON]8 [ORGANIZATION]4 in 2007.A senior source told [ORGANIZATION]3 that the [PERSON]8 operatives are not foot soldiers but the most senior [PERSON]8 operatives outside of [PERSON]8.

[PERSON]850 [URL]CbXHBUF89551  [DATE]8 [DATE]9 [DATE], DATE952 PERSON90 Dont Let [ORGANIZATION] Blow Up the [ORGANIZATION] . [ORGANIZATION]7 The precedent governing [ORGANIZATION]8 dictates that [PERSON]9 wins, because a preliminary vote must be held to decide whether a matter is procedural or substantive. That preliminary vote is subject to the permanent member veto, meaning [PERSON]9 could veto a motion by [ORGANIZATION]9 and [ORGANIZATION] to rule their question procedural. The underlying motion then becomes substantive, meaning it too is subject to a [PERSON] veto. This is known as the double veto power of a permanent member. It is the ace in the hole for each of the [LOCATION] though it has not been employed for [PERSON]7, this is a paradigm case for its proper use.Refusing to hold the preliminary vote, or denying [PERSON]9 right to use its veto in that vote, would not only violate 75 [ORGANIZATION]5 of [ORGANIZATION]9 precedent, it would forever change [ORGANIZATION]8. No longer would a permanent members veto be absolute instead, it would be subject to consensus opinion. The [ORGANIZATION] ORG7s might be the victim of such a coup in DATE9, but [ORGANIZATION]9, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]9, and GPE70 would all find their vetoes up for debate in [PERSON]9 and [ORGANIZATION]5 to come.With such a new reality, [PERSON] leaders might rethink the utility of [ORGANIZATION]8. Skepticism of the ORG60 system is already at an all-time high within ORG61, yet if [ORGANIZATION]9 and [ORGANIZATION] increasingly get their [STREET], Democrats, too, may come to see the council as a liability, not an asset. Calls for [PERSON]9 withdrawal from [ORGANIZATION] might become mainstream. Withdrawal is not likely to be a priority if former Vice President PERSON29 is elected president. But what about four [ORGANIZATION]5 later if former Ambassador to [ORGANIZATION] PERSON11, Secretary of ORG7 PERSON91, Sen. PERSON92, or Sen. PERSON93 is elected?So now it is time for [PERSON]2 and GPE71 to take a deep breath and evaluate the magnitude of the diplomatic decision before them. PERSON94 and PERSON95 can still avoid a diplomatic showdown at FAC3. They could opt to trigger the snapback themselves, a logical step DATE61 after initiating the ORG63 dispute resolution process with nothing to show for it. If theyd rather oppose snapback and maintain support for the ORG64 until the very end, [ORGANIZATION]1SCR 2231 gives them the tools to do that, too. Either country could introduce the resolution to ignore the [PERSON] complaint and keep the ORG64 alive. While [PERSON]9 could veto the resolution, GPE70 and [ORGANIZATION]9 would get to save face by voting to keep the nuclear deal and condemning the [PERSON]s for killing itall without shredding the permanent member veto and risking the collapse of [ORGANIZATION].But if either leader sides with [ORGANIZATION]9 and [ORGANIZATION] against [PERSON]9 double veto right, they will not only shoulder the blame for the arms embargo on [ORGANIZATION] expiring, but will also bear the responsibility for the beginning of the end of modern multilateralism.[ORGANIZATION] claims victory after [ORGANIZATION]1 soundly rejects [PERSON]1 bid to extend arms embargo54 [ORGANIZATION] on DATE22 hailed a [ORGANIZATION]1 [ORGANIZATION]9 vote rejecting a [PERSON]1 bid to extend an arms embargo on the [ORGANIZATION]ic republic, saying its foe has never been so isolated.President PERSON74 said [PERSON]9 had failed to kill off what he called the half alive DATE62 deal with major powers that gave [ORGANIZATION] relief from sanctions in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program.The [ORGANIZATION] ORG7s failed in this conspiracy with humiliation, PERSON75 told a televised news conference.In my opinion, [PERSON] will go down in the history of our [ORGANIZATION] and in the history of fighting global arrogance.Only two of the ORG66 15 members voted in favor of the [PERSON]1 resolution seeking to extend the embargo, highlighting the division between [PERSON]3 and its European allies since [PERSON]1 President [PERSON] withdrew from the [ORGANIZATION] nuclear accord in [LOCATION] 2018.[PERSON]3s European allies all abstained, and [ORGANIZATION] mocked the [PERSON] administration for only winning the support of one other country, GPE73.

The details of the [PERSON]1 seizing the gas on board the tankers was part of an effort by [PERSON]3 to stop multi-million-dollar fuel shipments to GPE74 that violate [PERSON]1 sanctions.These actions represent the governments largest-ever seizure of fuel shipments from [ORGANIZATION], the [PERSON]1 ORG71 said.The [PERSON]1 has vowed to cut [ORGANIZATION]ian exports of oil and gas to near zero. [ORGANIZATION] has a capacity to produce 3.7 million barrels of oil per day and consumes some 1.7 million of them a day.

Was [ORGANIZATION] connected? PERSON101, co-founder of ORG75 suggests the explanation may be more complex than it appears.Lets start with what we know. [ORGANIZATION]s use of military forces to board the commercial vessel in international waters constituted a blatant violation of international law, the [ORGANIZATION] said. It now turns out that the ORG74 did not call for help.Sentinel, which is the ORG77 aspect of the [ORGANIZATION], said its mission is to deter and expose this malign activity and reassure the maritime community.

For example, in [ORGANIZATION] the [ORGANIZATION] was forced to pay damages to [ORGANIZATION], which supports traditional marriage, after an employee, whose specific identity was never publicly uncovered, leaked information on ORG2 donors to an LGBT rights organization. There is simply no need for the [ORGANIZATION] to maintain donor information that might be accidentally released, leaked by a rogue employee, or used by unscrupulous politicians to harass political opponents...Finally, we might ask why, absent a very good reason, the federal government should ever be collecting data on our memberships and donations in the first [STREET]. What business of the government is it if you belong to a fishing club or [ORGANIZATION], or want to support [LOCATION] or [ORGANIZATION], Expert Tells JudgesBy PERSON0 [PERSON] kicked off the [ORGANIZATION] [DATE] judicial conference [ORGANIZATION] by telling a ORG6 ballroom full of judges that [ORGANIZATION] has a big free speech problem.Polls indicate that 40 percent of millennials favor speech codes and government sanctions for offensive speech. And what really worries me the most is were losing this coming generation, he said...[PERSON] Judge [PERSON] posited that millennials may have lost faith in the system. He pointed to [ORGANIZATION] v. [ORGANIZATION], a GPE1 [ORGANIZATION]2 decision that essentially granted corporations the same free speech rights as people, as a possible cause of generational disillusionment.Millennials are perhaps valuing the rights of free speech less because of the sense that they have little control in light of decisions such as [ORGANIZATION]. We grew up believing there was a marketplace of ideas and that the answer to bad speech was more speech, PERSON3, of [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION], said.But theres also this sense a lot of people have that the system is rigged. [ORGANIZATION]0 enacted restrictions on campaign financing to try to even the playing field, and the [STREET] dismissed all of the concerns by [ORGANIZATION]0. And it seems all those concerns are coming true. So theres a lot of disillusion.While [PERSON] said he agreed with the [ORGANIZATION] decision in terms of free speech, he agreed with [ORGANIZATION] point on disillusionment and corporate involvement in politics.I do think part of the problem were having with millennials is that there is this sense that they are no longer in control of their determination, he said. But there is something much more fundamental with this generation. I think we win them over by convincing them that they can still have a voice.[ORGANIZATION]2[ORGANIZATION] Post [ORGANIZATION]2 picks remarks on PERSON5 case open new front in confirmation fightBy PERSON6 and Robert Barnes[ORGANIZATION]2 nominee PERSON8 DATE2 remarks questioning the landmark ruling that forced President [PERSON] to turn over the Watergate tapes opened a new front in the battle over his confirmation, ensuring his views on executive power will square prominently in [ORGANIZATION]3 hearings.Included in the thousands of pages turned over to the [ORGANIZATION]3 Judiciary Committee DATE3 is a DATE4 transcript of a panel discussion in which the future [ORGANIZATION]2 nominee opined whether the tensions of [PERSON] led to an erroneous decision in the case [PERSON] PERSON5.Although [PERSON]0 has defended the [ORGANIZATION] ruling in other remarks, Democrats have seized on his skepticism from [LOCATION] to build a key argument against the nominee That he wont be a sufficient check on the president who appointed him...Democrats have also focused on [PERSON]0s rulings in favor of broad presidential power and his criticism of the independent counsel law to suggest that he would protect [PERSON]2 from special counsel [PERSON]3 IIIs probe. The judge has been outspoken in saying, for instance, that he would put the final nail in the now-defunct independent counsel law.But it is unclear whether [PERSON]0s dim view of the independent counsel law extends to separate special-counsel regulations governing [PERSON]4 investigation into Russian interference in the DATE8 presidential election. [PERSON]4 legal battle with [PERSON]2s lawyers over his request to interview the president could end up before the [ORGANIZATION]2.On the PERSON5 decision, [PERSON]0s allies rallied to his defense.

In a few instances noted, several of the defendants actions came close to crossing the line from activity protected by the First Amendment to conduct prohibited by [ORGANIZATION], she wrote.[ORGANIZATION]0NBC News Democrats and the [ORGANIZATION] finally agree on something How to use [ORGANIZATION] loopholes to fund luxury lifestylesBy [PERSON]1 and [PERSON]2 runaway spending was brought to light in a new report, How Leadership [ORGANIZATION]s Became Politicians Preferred Ticket to Luxury Living, released on [ORGANIZATION]1 by our two government reform groups, ORG21 and ORG22. The report highlights many bipartisan abuses of a source of funds little known beyond the beltway, but widely exploited within it so-called leadership [ORGANIZATION]s...The kicker Much of this spending would likely be illegal if politicians used their official campaign accounts to pick up the tab. These kinds of expenses cannot be paid with campaign money because campaign donations present a much greater risk of buying access or influence if they are funding the politicians next round of golf, country club membership, clothing purchase, or trip to ORG23.So how are these abuses possible? Because while [PERSON] has long prohibited politicians from spending official campaign funds on personal expenditures, they have failed to apply this personal use prohibition to leadership [ORGANIZATION]s. And [ORGANIZATION]0, which has the power to police its own members, has also remained on the sidelines...The [ORGANIZATION] should adopt new rules clarifying that the personal use prohibition that already applies to campaign accounts also applies to leadership [ORGANIZATION]s. This would be an easy step, and the [ORGANIZATION] clearly has the authority to take it.For its part, [ORGANIZATION]0 could pass legislation to crack down on leadership [ORGANIZATION]s, and the ethics committees in the ORG25 and [ORGANIZATION]3 could enforce their rules applying a personal use ban to leadership [ORGANIZATION]s.The ORG26 Dem senators probe financial links between [PERSON]3, ORG27 [PERSON]4 Sens.

In [DATE], messages on [ORGANIZATION]4 falsely claimed a government-mandated yellow-fever vaccine was dangerous, leading people to avoid it. And as [PERSON] was heading into its presidential election [ORGANIZATION]5, experts there called [ORGANIZATION]4 the ugly underbelly of the countrys news environment, a [STREET] where politically misleading stories, memes and messages can spread unchecked...Unlike the largely open forums of [ORGANIZATION]5 and [ORGANIZATION]6, [ORGANIZATION]4 hosts private chats among groups of friends. It is encrypted, or mathematically scrambled, so that no one - not even the services employees - can read the content of messages that were not intended for them...Executives held urgent meetings with political leaders in GPE10 [ORGANIZATION]2, and the service is building new technology to promote news literacy.

The [ORGANIZATION] was refunded 5,5[DATE] [ORGANIZATION]8 [DATE], citing overpayment...Its illegal for such leadership [ORGANIZATION] money, which members of [ORGANIZATION]0 use for donating money to other political candidates and committees, to be used for non-commercial air travel. Exceptions described in federal law are government-owned planes or planes already owned or leased by the congressman or candidate...PERSON45, an [ORGANIZATION] spokesman, said candidates can use leadership [ORGANIZATION] money for chartering private jets in certain cases. It has to be chartered through a company set up for that specific purpose and candidates have to pay the market rate. In those cases, chartering a private jet can fall under commercial air travel according to the [ORGANIZATION]s interpretation, [LOCATION] said.The law concerning this was mainly set up to prevent candidates from using a corporations private jet, or that of a wealthy donor, [LOCATION] said, adding leadership [ORGANIZATION] complaints are uncommon because candidates get a wide discretion in their use.But PERSON47, senior counsel at the nonpartisan [LOCATION]3 and a former senior counsel to an [ORGANIZATION] commissioner, said any chartering of private flights by a leadership [ORGANIZATION] is a clear illegal use under the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act passed in 2007.HarassmentReason GPE15 Food Cart Shuts Down Following Harassment by Occupy [LOCATION]6 ProtestersBy PERSON48-owned by couple PERSON49 and PERSON50, [LOCATION]4 used to do steady business serving food to the federal agents who worked across the [STREET]. The two used the proceeds to help fund their non-profit [LOCATION]5, which supplies food and clothing to GPE15s homeless population.PERSON51 was initially supportive of the Occupy [LOCATION]6 protest when it started, according to comments she made DATE21. But the [PERSON] attempt to stay neutral and serve all who are hungry, including [LOCATION]6 and other [LOCATION]7 [LOCATION]8 staff who share the GPE15 office space, provoked anger from some anti-[LOCATION]6 demonstrators, who reportedly threatened staff at the food cart for failing to get on board with the struggle...According to PERSON49 [PERSON], the last straw came when protestors threatened his DATE22 daughter for serving food to a [LOCATION]8 employee. If they catch her outside the cart, theyre going to hurt her. Theyre constantly cussing at her and screaming at her, he told [LOCATION]9. According to the owners, protestors also threatened to burn down the cart.On [ORGANIZATION]1, DATE23 after protests began, a post went up on the [ORGANIZATION]0 [ORGANIZATION]5[ORGANIZATION]5 page announcing that the food cart would be shutting down. Reads the post We tried repeatedly to try to work out peaceful solutions with the organizations and individuals protesting, but it all came back to being told [DATE] to either support the anti [LOCATION]8 agenda or suffer the consequences Quote Unquote.Needless to say, threatening violence against third parties for not being sufficiently in favor of ones chosen cause is inexcusable. Its also remarkably counterproductive.Candidates and CampaignsRoll Call [ORGANIZATION]3 Candidates Mislead When Announcing Fundraising NumbersBy PERSON54 least two Republican [ORGANIZATION]3 candidates who kicked their own money into their campaigns issued misleading statements about their DATE24 fundraising [ORGANIZATION]5.Press releases that paint a rosier picture of candidates fundraising than their official DATE25 reports are a reminder of the anachronistic reporting standards to which only [ORGANIZATION]3 hopefuls are held.Unlike ORG25 candidates - or anyone else registered with [PERSON] - [ORGANIZATION]3 contenders do not have to file their reports electronically.They file them on paper, which means theres a lag between when the campaigns try to get good headlines by announcing their numbers to the press and when the press is able to actually review those reports. Local reporters, though, have been picking up on the discrepancies.[ORGANIZATION]1 PERSON55 blasts GPE17 mayoral candidate PERSON56 cash giveaway, state says he didnt violate campaign rulesBy PERSON57 and [PERSON] Pearson[ORGANIZATION]8oral candidate PERSON58 apparently did not violate election law by handing out more than 200,000 in cash and checks [DATE] to people at an event he attended with Gov.

And there doesnt appear to have been any quid pro quo, like, [PERSON] some money, vote for me. So from our perspective, it doesnt look like there was anything illegal about this.[ORGANIZATION] spokesman PERSON65 said the board is monitoring the situation. We havent received a formal complaint, and even if we did, we arent in the municipal campaign yet, so its not clear what our authority would be, other than to refer the situation to law enforcement, PERSON66 said.GPE[DATE] [ORGANIZATION]5 [ORGANIZATION]6 voter registration flap continues to stir debateBy PERSON67 progressive activist PERSON68 said his First Amendment rights were violated when he and other voter registration agents were told they could not circulate through [ORGANIZATION]7 of GPE[DATE] registering new voters.And so, PERSON69 was back at the market signing up new voters DATE27, [PERSON] after a compromise was reached preventing such activity.I dont think that compromise was appropriate. The city still hasnt solved the fundamental problem, PERSON69 said. By saying this activity, voter registration, has to be restrained is violating the First Amendment in a big [STREET] and New [PERSON] state law as it is interpreted when it comes to voter registration.PERSON69 said he didnt have any problems DATE27, despite the prohibition from the city and farmers market...PERSON69 said he understands [ORGANIZATION]7 is a nonprofit, but that doesnt change the fact that it is still on a public [STREET] which is available for free speech activities.Their lease does not preclude or change the fact that this a public main [STREET]. No matter what they have argued in the past, this is FAC0, PERSON69 said. Its a [STREET] managed by the city, which is us, the citizens, and I have every right to be here walking up and down the [STREET] asking people a question. ...[ORGANIZATION]0 Clerk PERSON49 [ORGANIZATION] said he is working with the farmers market to try and offer a permanent solution to the disagreement.[ORGANIZATION]8 [ORGANIZATION]1 fire union to sue city over alleged First Amendment violationBy PERSON71 a hastily called press conference [ORGANIZATION]6, [ORGANIZATION]1 firefighters union boss PERSON72 announced plans to sue the city for violating the First Amendment rights of firefighters gathering signatures on three charter amendment petitions at a [INSTITUTION] DATE29.City spokesman [PERSON], who attended the press conference, said immediately afterward that theres lengthy case law upholding the citys right to regulate free speech, pointing to language within a DATE30 memo that the union had distributed, and adding that the announcement was nothing more than a political stunt.What I think this is about DATE31 is an effort to distract from the unions own negative publicity. If any of you all have been following the [ORGANIZATION]9 coverage of the union, its been reported for DATE32 now that the fire union has not been appropriately disclosing or reporting its political activity, he said. I think what youre seeing is the union calling a press conference DATE31 about something months ago that case law has long since decided in our favor."

On [ORGANIZATION]0, PERSON20 campaign communications director [PERSON] called out ORG3 hypocrisy on this matter, noting that if people can protest in the streets by the tens of thousands, if people can riot, if people can gamble in casinos, then certainly they can gather peaceably under the First Amendment to hear from the president of GPE18 [ORGANIZATION]2 Coronavirus Advisor Slams [ORGANIZATION]0 Censorship, Says [PERSON] is Like a Third-World Country127 Dr. [PERSON], one of the coronavirus task force members of the [ORGANIZATION]2, has condemned the [LOCATION] social medias doings to suppress narratives surrounding the [ORGANIZATION] pandemic.

Standing at FAC3, just meters from [PERSON] where the Oslo Accord were signed 27 [LOCATION]0 on [PERSON], the comparison between the two agreements was inescapable. That ceremony was an act of political theater unsurpassed in the history of [LOCATION]5. [ORGANIZATION]6, chairman of the ORG86, and architect of modern terrorism, grinned ear to ear as he received the royal treatment on the [ORGANIZATION]2 Lawn. Seeking peace, [LOCATION]5s then-Prime Minister [ORGANIZATION]7 promised the ORG86 land, money and weaponry, which [ORGANIZATION]8 used to build a terror state on the outskirts of [LOCATION]8. [ORGANIZATION]8 in turn promised to end terrorism, accept [LOCATION]5s right to exist and resolve all outstanding issues through peaceful negotiations. [ORGANIZATION]8 was lying. I wanted to believe in the fake peace of DATE57. But the grim facts made it impossible. For [DATE] [LOCATION], first as a member of [LOCATION]5s negotiating team during my service in the ORG87 and then as a writer and a lecturer, like thousands of other [LOCATION]5is and friends of [LOCATION]5 in the [PERSON] and around the world, I devoted myself to exposing the lies and warning about the danger of empowering those who seek [LOCATION]5s destruction. I wrote hundreds of articles, briefed hundreds of politicians and community leaders in the [PERSON] and worldwide. I wrote a book. And as I sat in the garden at the [ORGANIZATION]2 DATE45, with Prime Minister PERSON80, [PERSON] President [PERSON] PERSON20, [LOCATION]9 Foreign Minister [PERSON] PERSON82 and [LOCATION]7 Foreign Minister [PERSON] standing in the portico before me, the names of the victims of that previous peace agreement rushed through my head. PERSON84, [ORGANIZATION], PERSON86, PERSON87, PERSON88, the PERSON89, the [ORGANIZATION]0, the [ORGANIZATION]1, the [ORGANIZATION]2, [ORGANIZATION]3, [ORGANIZATION]4 and on and on and [PERSON] to GPE40s Economic Plea158 by [ORGANIZATION]5 The ORG88 reaffirmed its vow to support GPE40 after President [ORGANIZATION]6 requested economic help DATE9.

President PERSON101 issued an executive order barring [PERSON] citizens from doing business with the GPE40n government in addition to embargoing oil imports. President [PERSON] PERSON20 doubled-down on the hard-line approach to GPE40, citing human rights abuses. Much like the PERSON20 administrations maximum pressure campaign against GPE41, the [PERSON] may sanction any individual, anywhere in the world for conducting business deals with [ORGANIZATION]9. 159 [LOCATION] [LOCATION] Plan Gets ORG81 Support160 GPE19 has managed to get the majority of [PERSON]an Union states to agree with its proposed aid package for [LOCATION], which would be implemented as long as [LOCATION] agrees to hold free elections. The foreign policy initiative is [LOCATION] boldest within the ORG81 since [ORGANIZATION]0 of the [LOCATION] crisis. It should also help GPE19 to offset the disputes it has been having with the ORG81 under the present administration in GPE43. The program for [LOCATION] is modelled on that which GPE44 instituted for GPE19 in [ORGANIZATION]1. The plan is seen as a counter to GPE29n President [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]8s offer of a credit line of 1.5 billion for [LOCATION], with the ORG81 offer initiated by GPE19 seen as more attractive. The ORG81 market that would be opened up for [LOCATION] is 12 times the size of that of GPE29.161 PERSON103 Calls Out ORG91 Censorship in GPE45 Theyve Bought Our Silence With Money162 PERSON103 is refusing to let ORG91 off the hook for allowing itself to be censored in international markets such as GPE45 in order to reap financial rewards. During a conversation with ORG92 PERSON104 on [ORGANIZATION] with PERSON104, PERSON105 criticized ORG91 for staying away from andor cutting out content that is critical of certain countries in order to make money. A lot of these giant corporate entities have business with countries around the world, GPE46 or GPE45, and theyre just not going to criticize them, PERSON105 said, and theyre not going to let their shows criticize them or theyre not going to air documentaries that go deep into truthful areas because they make so much money.163 PERSON20 to Block ORG94, ORG95 [PERSON] on [LOCATION]5164 The [ORGANIZATION] will ban transactions with ORG95 and ORG94 beginning on [LOCATION]5, ORG96 announced on [ORGANIZATION]. The announcement comes ahead of an expected statement from President PERSON20 on whether technology company [PERSON] will be allowed to take a minority stake in the Chinese-owned ORG94.165 GPE47 [ORGANIZATION] 30km to [PERSON] Chicken166 The man and woman had driven from GPE48 to GPE49  about 34km  when they were pulled over by [PERSON]0 Police in [TIME] to [ORGANIZATION].167 [ORGANIZATION] Theorists168 A draconian new coronavirus law could give Australian authorities the power to arrest coronavirus conspiracy theorists if its thought they may commit a crime in the future.

According to [PERSON]2 News, the Turkish asylum seekers then attacked the farmer and attempted to steal his gun. Police would arrive [TIME], but the farmer suffered a ruptured tendon and other injuries. The Turks would be charged, but after making contact with connections in [PERSON]7, the farmer was later charged for making a racially motivated attack against the asylum seekers.173 Greek Minister Claims Closed Borders Have Cost People Traffickers 100 Million174 Greek Minister for [ORGANIZATION] PERSON106 has claimed that people traffickers have lost as much as 100 million due to the reduction in migrants flowing into [PERSON]5.

Both countries indicate they are willing to help financially but will not take any migrants in, which has been consistent with the migration stance of both countries over the [LOCATION]. In DATE5 of [ORGANIZATION]4, both countries signed a letter to the [ORGANIZATION]5, along with five other [PERSON]an nations, rejecting further migrant quotas in the [PERSON]an Union. [PERSON]8 will give [PERSON]5 almost 97,420 2.6 million korunas and GPE25 will offer 60,000 to help with the destroyed [PERSON]9 migrant camp on the island of Lesbos.177 One Witness Named Five of the Six Afghans That Burnt [PERSON]9 Migrant Camp178 The testimony of a witness and a video posted on social media [TIME] the [PERSON]9 migrant camp was destroyed by fire led to the identification of six young Afghans accused of setting the fire. In addition to the testimonies of police and firefighters, who described what happened on [TIME] of [DATE] 8, the case file includes the testimony of an Afghan national who named five of those arrested as the people who led the arson of the camp. The sixth detainee was identified by a video posted on social media in which he appears to be setting fire to bushes using a burning cardboard. He is one of the two [ORGANIZATION]7 who were transported inland [ORGANIZATION]8 after the fire, along with more than 200 unaccompanied minors. In fact, at the time of his arrival, he is said to have been dressed in the same clothes he wore on [TIME] of the arson.

With the recent announcement of a new PERSON113 game, [PERSON], and the recent release of PERSON114 latest book, [PERSON], the online targeting of [LOCATION] has intensified with news outlet [ORGANIZATION] even going as far as branding her transphobic. But one of the most surprising sources to come out against [LOCATION] and brand her anti-trans is [ORGANIZATION]  a nonprofit that describes itself as our nations guardian of liberty, working [PERSON]1 in courts, legislatures and communities to defend and preserve the individual rights and liberties that the Constitution and laws of the GPE26 guarantee everyone in this country.185 Church Launches [LOCATION]5 School Ad Depicting PERSON116 as Bearded Lady With Breasts186 [ORGANIZATION]0 has raised eyebrows with a [LOCATION]5 School advert depicting PERSON116 Christ sporting a long beard and apparently bouncing breasts.

portland,2020-09-25T00:00:00Z,The Nation Blogs,OPB,"homeless, homelessness, housing crisis, affordable housing",Climate Disasters Are Leaving Families With Nowhere to Go,"She didnt see any smoke. But within [TIME] it was there, dark and ugly. [ORGANIZATION] was caring for her son in the mobile home where she lived south of [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], with her husband, father, and brothers. [ORGANIZATION] and her husband are undocumented immigrants from [ORGANIZATION], and because they are currently pursuing an asylum claim, we are withholding their last names. The men had left at [TIME] for work picking pears, apples, and grapes on a nearby farm. When the smoke got thick, [ORGANIZATION], who doesnt [STREET], called her husband to pick her up. By that time, police had arrived in the neighborhood and were telling everyone to leave. Nearby, [ORGANIZATION] recalls, everything was burning. She gathered a few legal documents, took her son by the hand, and fled. There is virtually nothing left now of the mobile home where [ORGANIZATION] lived. Most of her neighborhood, which was home to a number of immigrant families, was swallowed by the [ORGANIZATION] fire, one of more than 2,000 wildfires that ripped across [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION] and [LOCATION]. In [PERSON] they consumed a million acres, double the [ORGANIZATION] average for [ORGANIZATION]. In GPE4, fires tore through an area almost of the size of [PERSON]. The blazes drove tens of thousands of people from their homes, and the smoke trapped everyone else. For [PERSON] it felt as if the world had shrunk, the horizon invisible behind layers of smog, the air the color of dirty sherbet. In [LOCATION], which for several [PERSON] had the worst air [PERSON] of any city in the world, the haze eventually lifted like a lid off the city. But for people like [ORGANIZATION] the crisis is hardly over. [ORGANIZATION], her husband, [PERSON], and her son, [ORGANIZATION], who is [ORGANIZATION] and has developmental delays, came to GPE7 DATE7, and moved into the mobile home that her father owned and had lived in for DATE8. Now thats gone, along with the cars that were parked outside and everything else the family had besides the clothes they were wearing, the car the men had taken to work [TIME], and the few documents that [ORGANIZATION] managed to grab. The family of seven spent [TIME] in the parking lot of FAC0 along with thousands of other [ORGANIZATION]. Then they moved into a small camper on the farm where [PERSON] works and, recently, into a larger camper purchased with donations from a GoFundMe campaign3. [PERSON] and the other men kept picking fruit in the choking smoke. Not working wasnt much of an option. No one has gotten sick, thank PERSON3, [ORGANIZATION] said. They need to work, because now we dont have a house, and the cars were burned. [ORGANIZATION]s family didnt have any kind of home insurance, she said, nor did most others who lost homes in her neighborhood. Finding a new one wont be easy. Affordable housing was already scarce in LOC2, an agricultural area home to a significant immigrant community. Before the fires the area had a rental vacancy rate below 2 percent, according to [ORGANIZATION], one of the lowest in the country. A third5 of the residents of [ORGANIZATION], a town of 6,500 just south of [ORGANIZATION] that was substantially demolished by the [ORGANIZATION] fire, were already spending more than half of their income on rent. [PERSON] was on the rise6. Now, a longtime real estate agent in [ORGANIZATION] that the vast majority of what low- and moderately priced housing there was in the area has been destroyed. Its like this fire went after the poorest and most vulnerable people in our community, a city councilor in [PERSON]0, another community wrecked by the flames, told the ORG1. [LOCATION]s fires are likely the most intense wildfire event8 in [PERSON]s history. Thanks to climate change, the conditions that drove the fireincluding a long drought and high windsare becoming a new normal. For a rising number of families, so is the colossal task of starting over. As climate change magnifies ecological riskmaking hurricanes stronger9, wildfires fiercer and less predictable10its also amplifying inequity. DATE9, [ORGANIZATION]0 ORG1 reporters spent [LOCATION]0 reporting[ORGANIZATION] from one of the largest homeless encampments in [PERSON]1, [PERSON]2, and found that many people were there because of natural disasters. One woman lost her home to a [LOCATION]1 wildfire in GPE4 another lost hers to Hurricane Harvey in [PERSON]3. Undocumented immigrants are particularly vulnerable, according to a forthcoming paper12 in the journal [LOCATION] that analyzes the emergency response and recovery effort after a massive [LOCATION]2 wildfire in GPE4 Despite being on the front lines of disaster, the paper reads, explicit exclusion from recovery and relief efforts leaves undocumented immigrants without a safety net in GPE4s [LOCATION]3 wildfire season. In [PERSON] now, its easy to see how climate events, overlaid on top of a housing crisis, wage stagnation, and a pandemic, could leave families like [ORGANIZATION]s with nowhere to go. This problem will only get worse, because in a sense the world is shrinking13. Across the globe, coastlines are disappearing. [PERSON] is seeping inland, deadening agricultural fields. Deserts are [LOCATION], as an atmospheric circulation pattern called the [PERSON] cell, which creates a dry, hot band around the middle of the earth roughly from the top of the [PERSON] down to the bottom of the [ORGANIZATION], shifts northward. Without a dramatic change in global greenhouse gas emissions, extreme heat will become [LOCATION] in the [PERSON] and [PERSON]western [PERSON]5, as well as a swath through [PERSON]6, [PERSON]7, [PERSON]8, and [PERSON]9 where a fifth16 of the worlds population lives. According to a recent [ORGANIZATION]0 ORG1ProPublica analysis, 28 million Americans, not just in the LOC7 but also in states like [ORGANIZATION]1 and [ORGANIZATION]2, are likely to face mega-fires by [LOCATION]4, while 100 million people live in areas projected to become so hot and humid that working outside will be a health hazard. As more and more people flee from natural disasters, there will be fewer and fewer decent places to go. [ORGANIZATION] went back to see what remained of their home a few [PERSON] after she evacuated. Everything turned to ashes. Nothing good remained, she said. Her family has gotten some assistance from local organizationsgroups like ORG6 [PERSON]s Latinx farmworker union, [ORGANIZATION], are distributing aidbut she said that to actually rebuild or find a new home, she and other families will need a lot more help. [ORGANIZATION]s father and brothers, who have legal status, could go back to [ORGANIZATION] for a while and then return, but shes still waiting on a [STREET] date for her asylum case, and has had trouble finding legal assistance. My son, my husband and I, it will be more difficult for us because we do not have a work permit, she said. We want to stay here because we are honorable people and we want to work, to have a better future for our child. Asked what about that future she thinks the fire will change, [ORGANIZATION] said, Well, everything.  1  2  3 38utm_campaignp_cpshare-sheetamp38utm_mediumcopy_link_all  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  [ORGANIZATION]  12  13  14  15  16  17  18"

portland,2021-10-04T00:00:00Z,Axios,OPB,affordable housing,Low morale hinders [ORGANIZATION] police recruitment,"Why it matters. Police departments say low morale has put a dent in their efforts to recruit for positions that are under intense scrutiny by the public amid high-profile officer-involved shootings in [ORGANIZATION] and around the country. Details Police departments and sheriffs offices can obtain the bonuses by applying for grant funding through the states [ORGANIZATION] through [ORGANIZATION]. Personnel eligible for the bonuses include state, local or school police officers criminal investigators probation and parole officers firefighters [ORGANIZATION] sheriffs and their deputies corrections officers bailiffs fish and game wardens and 911 dispatchers. [ORGANIZATION] whats sure to be a stiff reelection battle from presumed Democratic challenger [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] has made support for law enforcement  and criticism of [ORGANIZATION] Mayor [PERSON] for the citys spike in crime  part of his platform2. The governor used 2 million from the states emergency fund to create a crime suppression unit made up of local police, state troopers and other law enforcement officers to address crime in the area, the [ORGANIZATION] Journal-Constitution3 notes. Yes, but While the bonuses could offer a short-term boost in morale, leaders of local public safety agencies say a lot more needs to be done to help hire new and keep seasoned officers. ORG2 reached out to the [ORGANIZATION] [INSTITUTION], which declined to participate in this story. However, the agency said on its [ORGANIZATION] that more people are showing an interest in joining its ranks. [PERSON] said his department has 124 vacancies, which is down from 171 when he took office in [LOCATION]. While [ORGANIZATION] said the bonuses are a magnificent first step in addressing low morale in law enforcement, local departments have to be more creative in keeping current employees and attracting candidates. To attract new hires, [ORGANIZATION] says, [PERSON] commissioners raised the sheriffs offices starting salary for deputies to 50,000. The department now offers a 9,000 signing bonus to anyone who commits to working for DATE2 at the [PERSON] Jail as a deputy. The department, which has just under 1,100 people on staff, is also considering providing a 250 child care stipend for single parents, the sheriff said. To speed up the hiring process, the department conducts on-site physical fitness assessments at job fairs. You have young people who want to fight crime, but we do a poor job of marketing ourselves, [ORGANIZATION] says. The other side Some criticism has been lodged at [PERSON] for using federal coronavirus relief funds to pay for law enforcement bonuses. PERSON5, communications director for [ORGANIZATION], said law enforcement agencies have been talking about low morale for [ORGANIZATION], even after they get everything they ask for. I think its especially hard to hear that this is coming for COVID relief funds in a state thats been utterly decimated by [PERSON], she said. [PERSON] said instead of providing bonuses to officers, [PERSON] could use that funding to help provide access to affordable housing, healthcare and educational opportunities supporting people who are at risk of domestic violence and sexual assault and ensuring people housed in correctional facilities are safe and healthy.  1  2  3  4"

This recent surge in discussion of neighborhood associations made me wonder what authority do these organizations really have? ORG3 recognizes5 95 neighborhood associations, grouped into seven district coalitions."
portland,2017-11-10T00:00:00Z,JD Supra,OPB,homeless,[ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] After [ORGANIZATION],"[ORGANIZATION] publishes standards6 and [ORGANIZATION] to which the associations must adhere. In return, the associations receive funding, assistance, and official recognition read political clout. According to [ORGANIZATION], coalitions and associations will receive over 2.5 million DATE1, amounting to a quarter of [ORGANIZATION] total [ORGANIZATION] budget. The associations and coalitions do not wield governmental power. By [STREET] of voting on resolutions or lobbying the ORG2, they provide community input to the ORG2 on decisions such as permitting or law enforcement. But neighborhood resolutions are not laws or ordinances. For example, the recent [ORGANIZATION] resolution urges the ORG2 to stop sweeping homeless camps in the neighborhood, warning that they may be unconstitutional and may constitute human rights violations. Theoretically, a neighborhood association could sue a government on behalf of its members or in its own right, but the neighborhood resolution does not actually prohibit the ORG2 from sweeping camps in the neighborhood. Despite not having governmental power, neighborhood associations can make powerful allies or enemies in efforts to influence how, when, and where [ORGANIZATION] continues to develop. Some commentators9 have noted that, in a ORG2 whose [ORGANIZATION] is not based on geographic districts, the neighborhood associations can play an outsize role as chief cheerleaders for geographically-centered issues, and have a history of success. Still, others10 have highlighted criticisms that neighborhood associations have failed to represent the breadth of demographics and viewpoints of their residents. Some residents have even accused [ORGANIZATION] developers of injecting their agendas through the neighborhood associations, ghostwriting proposals to be presented to the ORG2 [ORGANIZATION] and added to [ORGANIZATION] records. Other sources11 cite neighborhoods current and historic resistance to rapid development. I dont always agree with some of [ORGANIZATION]s neighborhood association resolutions and statements, including from my own neighborhood. But I take heart in the enthusiasm with which my community engages neighbors, organizes before governmental bodies, and looks critically on itself.

portland,2020-06-05T00:00:00Z,Dissident Voice,OPB,homelessness,On Strawmen and Racism,"First, as it is worded, it posits that white people are a monolith, that all white people are racist. Second, it posits that the election was decided between being white and black and not between being Democrat and Republican. Third, and most egregiously, the question posits that the white racism, to any significant degree, does not exist. His second question  Are white people racist by nature?  is a strawman. First skin pigmentation does not correlate with an inherited attitude. Obviously any racism is inculcated or otherwise learned. You are not born into the world a racist. Then [ORGANIZATION] asserts, based on the false premise, Those who say whites are racist by nature simultaneously claim that hundreds of thousands of [ORGANIZATION] soldiers died in order to free black people from slavery and that white people in the [ORGANIZATION] carried on a relentless long war against white people in the [PERSON] for the benefit of black people. [ORGANIZATION] claims that the Civil War was simply to free black people from slavery. ORG1 framed3 it otherwise, A common explanation is that the Civil War was fought over the moral issue of slavery. In fact, it was the economics of slavery and political control of that system that was central to the conflict. At the time of the Civil War, [ORGANIZATION]s argument must be that northern whites were not racist, at least not by nature, but the southern whites must be racist since they practiced slavery or were insouciant to the practice around them. The argument that whites are not racist is becoming puzzling because whites are being divided up into those who are not racist because they are opposed to slavery and those who support slavery, hence they must be racist based on their behavior. As far as northern whites are concerned, the writer has answered his own question about whether slavery is a part of the white peoples nature. Or is [ORGANIZATION] hypothesizing that such a nature can be overcome? Moreover, if slavery equates with racism and data indicates that it does because seldom was slavery imposed by whites on other whites in the [ORGANIZATION], and never chattel slavery, then [ORGANIZATION] must by virtue of his argument agree that, prior to the Civil War when slavery was also practiced in northern states, the slave owners and those who were silent about slavery in their region were racist. [ORGANIZATION] continues to try and shoot down the notion of white-on-black racism It is these same racist white people who passed the DATE0 Civil Rights Act DATE1 and permitted the establishment of racial quotas and contract set-asides for blacks that gave blacks rights and privileges that white people do not have. Here [ORGANIZATION] cherrypicks points to support his thesis that whites and I maintain this must be understood as some whites are not racist. However, the comparatively preponderant mass incarceration4 of blacks, the comparatively preponderant shootings of blacks5 by police, the comparatively preponderant homelessness of [PERSON] and so much more7 points to racism being entrenched and systemic. Since whites rule the roost, these white roosters and the white bystanders bear responsibility. The writer continues to press his viewpoint, If white people are so racist, how can it be that many of them are upset about PERSON1 death from police violence and some joined the protests? Either white people are racist by nature or they arent racist by nature. First, it was [ORGANIZATION] who came up with the strawman argument that white racism is part of white nature. The premise, as already argued, is fallacious and to argue against ones own fallacious premise is plainly illogical. Second, now the writer points out that many whites are upset about PERSON1 death from police violence ergo, there are some whites who are supposedly insouciant or maybe even pleased about the police killing. The conclusion is that not all whites are racist and certainly not by nature racist. The writer asks, So what is police violence against white people? Are white people murdered and brutalized by police because of their skin color? Is this structural violence against white people? The writer wants to look at a multifaceted issue with a black-and-white lens. Obviously that is a wrongheaded [STREET] to approach any issue. If one genuinely wants to understand an issue, one should consider all the possible causes related to the outcome in question, and not investigate only as an either-or issue the latter being a path to bias and prejudice. No reasonable thinker denies that there are factors beside racism that predispose police to brutality and killing. Peer pressure, the corrupting influence of power, militarization, media glorification of cops, etc. People know that some police run rackets, engage in the drug trade, sex trade, accept freebies, practice extortion, etc. Cops that do not participate but know of such criminality among their ranks are also bad apples. Although there are a plethora of bad apples in the police orchard, few would argue that all cops are bad apples. However, given the sordid side of policing and the militarization of policing in the [ORGANIZATION]A, becoming a cop might not be the best career choice for a morally centered person. There may be some who enter a career in policing ignorant of the systemic racism and criminality and others who know but vainly hope that they can be part of bringing policing back to the role of serving the public. [ORGANIZATION] continues, A multicultural racially diverse society, which [ORGANIZATION] has become as a result of illegal immigration and the change in immigration law in [DATE], cannot survive if race hatred is a feature of the society. No country can survive if race hatred is a feature of the country. As for illegal immigration, why frame it in terms of legality? Was it legal when Europeans slaughtered the [ORGANIZATION] peoples of LOC2 and stole their land? Who is primarily responsible for the emergence of a multicultural racially diverse society which I see as an enrichment of a tolerant society? Was it not white people who violently inserted themselves into a continent of several [ORGANIZATION] nations? Was it not white people who abducted [PERSON] as chattel? [ORGANIZATION] criticizes the protestors None of those screaming racism are interested in stopping police violence. If they are not interested in stopping police violence, then why are people in the streets? As for screaming racism, a random sampling of the placards does not indicate racism as a motif of the protestors. The abundance of signs read8 Black Lives Matter, I cant breathe, Justice [PERSON], and No Peace, No Justice. [ORGANIZATION] raises another strawman Of course there are racists, but the assumption that these animosities exist only between skin colors is problematic. In modern times the most extreme manifestitions sic of racial violence are tribal between blacks themselves, such as the Rwandan genocide, the mass slaughter of [LOCATION] by the [PERSON]. Who assumes animosities exist only between skin colors? It seems that [ORGANIZATION] argues this to attack black-on-black violence. He elides white-on-white extreme violence such as Nazi Germans against other Europeans, Jews, and Communists the British-on-Irish violence etc. [ORGANIZATION] also is ignorant of the western read white worlds involvement in the Rwandan genocide.19 [ORGANIZATION] raises another point of contention. Indeed, the black slave trade is the product of blacks themselves and has its origin in [LOCATION] in the slave wars fought by the black GPE3. It is as if it never was written. It is not down the memory hole. This is tu quoque argumentation by [ORGANIZATION]. It is elementary morality that we are responsible for our crimes and atoning for those crimes. That blacks also practiced slavery does not make white slavery against blacks or any other peoples any more acceptable. All slavery is abhorrent, but our focus should primarily be on righting our wrongs. [ORGANIZATION] asserts, [ORGANIZATION], of course, have committed far more violence against one another than they have against people of color. First, [ORGANIZATION] verges on contradicting himself, as he wrote in the same article In modern times the most extreme manifestitions sic of racial violence are tribal between blacks themselves. Second, [ORGANIZATION], too often, does not substantiate what he writes. According to professor [PERSON], The destruction of the [PERSON]ns of the [PERSON] was, far and away, the most massive act of genocide in the history of the world.210  After [ORGANIZATION], 95 percent of the [ORGANIZATION] people were wiped out maybe 100 million.311 Third, the logic fails big time because no one denies inter-group violence. Does that mean that one cannot feel prejudice toward an out-group member? During the world wars, blacks and [ORGANIZATION] peoples joined the military and fought even though still experiencing discrimination and racism within the military against the enemies of the [ORGANIZATION]. Nationalism can often cause a coming together of different groupings within a country. [ORGANIZATION] complains, Even white language is said to be racist. The banned n-word is said to be symbolic of white racism. But every white ethnicity has been called names that are slurs dago, polack, frog, [PERSON]. The Irish are bog-trotters. White language!? What is white language? Is that English as is spoken by so much of the world that includes African countries, [PERSON], [PERSON], etc? As for slurs, there are words better avoided because of the hurt and offense they can cause to others.412 [ORGANIZATION] asserts that his questions do matter to a racially diverse multicultural society.Such a society cannot survive the cultivation of racial enmity. When the goal is revolution, not reform, racial enmity is the weapon. I postulate that a great deal of the protests are because proposed reforms have led nowhere. The system perpetuates itself. It is the system that needs to be overthrown and replaced. That calls for revolution. As PERSON3 once said, I am said to be a revolutionist in my sympathies, by birth, by breeding and by principle. I am always on the side of the revolutionists, because there never was a revolution unless there were some oppressive and intolerable conditions against which to revolute.513[ORGANIZATION]s depiction of the Rwandan genocide as against [LOCATION] by [PERSON] requires a note.

Sign up for our ORG2 DATE1.Did you [PERSON] you can support The [ORGANIZATION] by drinking wine? It wasnt exactly glad tidings for DATE2, but the workers of the world of [LOCATION] cheered loudly in [LOCATION] as they voted overwhelmingly to reject the companys latest contract offer2 for its thousands of [ORGANIZATION] service employees. The workers chose to demand more negotiations rather than settle for a miserly wage offer, even if it meant heading into [DATE] with more uncertainty. Ad Policy3 The political climate has raised the stakes for the wage talks, as [ORGANIZATION] massive hospitality workforce has been besieged by [PERSON], stagnant wages amid soaring costs of living, and, under [ORGANIZATION], an onslaught of federal immigration crackdowns. [LOCATION], meanwhile, is rounding out [ORGANIZATION] with a deal to take over the ORG6 empire. According to the contract schedule, the union can renegotiate wages [ORGANIZATION] as part of a contract renewal in [LOCATION]. [LOCATION]s last offer for a pay increase fell short of the demand from the union, [ORGANIZATION], for a [DATE] starting [TIME] wage. Currently only about one in eight of the 38,000 union workers, including some 10,000 hospitality and housekeeping staffers, along with cast members and ride operators, earns [TIME]. The last wage hike at [LOCATION] inched up starting pay from 8.03 to 10. The companys current proposal would increase raises from 6 to 10 percent over [PERSON], resulting in a boost in the floor wage of about 50 cents DATE10, and even less for higher-paid workers. The union has been pushing for living wages for DATE11, pointing out that many resort workers are being pushed into homelessness. While [LOCATION] previously promised to work toward fair and equitable terms4 in the negotiations, workers drew the line in [PERSON], rejecting [LOCATION]s bid by a vote of 9,117 to 643.Related Article While wage negotiations remain in limbo, the situation is even more complex for the [ORGANIZATION]an immigrants in [LOCATION]s workforce The [ORGANIZATION] administration is moving, over [DATE], to end Temporary Protected Status ORG95 for tens of thousands of immigrants from [ORGANIZATION], GPE2, [PERSON], and other countries who have lived and worked in [LOCATION] under special protections following massive environmental and social catastrophes in their homelands. Though the system is highly precarious, over DATE14 many immigrants from [ORGANIZATION] have used the temporary status to gain legal employment and sustain financial ties to disaster-stricken countries. Overall, ORG9 holders from [ORGANIZATION] have contributed an estimated 2.8 billion to [ORGANIZATION]s GDP over DATE[DATE]. Their remittances provide not only a massive infusion of much-needed cash for [ORGANIZATION]s deeply impoverished economystill not recovered from the aftermath of the [DATE] earthquakebut also support vital diaspora communities in [LOCATION]. Roughly half of the 110,000 [ORGANIZATION]an migrants residing in the [PERSON] are here on ORG9.They came as survivors of unprecedented environmental crisis since DATE16 the country has suffered political conflict, a catastrophic earthquake that destroyed much of the urban core, followed by a ferocious epidemic of cholera, and to [DATE] the country still remains extremely poor and unstable. The [ORGANIZATION] metro area is among the diasporas top host regions, with about 3,000 [ORGANIZATION]an ORG9 migrants. The local tourism sector, which [LOCATION] dominates, has provided a steady source of low-wage jobs for [ORGANIZATION]an immigrants. Collectively, while their DATE17 wages average only around 18,300 considerably less than Honduran or GPE2an ORG9 workers, [ORGANIZATION]an ORG9 holders contribute nearly 43 million per year6 in ORG10 and [ORGANIZATION] funds. At the same time, the ORG9 population has become a bulwark of diasporic communities in [LOCATION], comprising parents, students, and political activists, including active union members. The administrations announcement that it would cut off ORG9 triggered a nationwide public outcry from labor and civil-rights groups, who seek an immediate extension, as the [PERSON] administration had regularly done. The ORG9 end date has officially passed for [ORGANIZATION]ans, but, under public pressure, ORG12 is giving migrants until [LOCATION] to officially depart.Current Issue UNITE HERE organizer [ORGANIZATION] helped rally union activists and other migrant-rights groups to push for ORG9, as well as an extension of the DACA protections for undocumented youth, on behalf of some 500 [ORGANIZATION]an ORG9 [LOCATION] workers. The union has become a leading champion of immigrant workers rights7 under [ORGANIZATION], pressuring both employers and lawmakers to help protect undocumented workers from [LOCATION] raids and detention by establishing sanctuary policies in municipalities as well as for workplaces. Many of ORG[DATE] fellow union members have been on temporary status for DATE18, but are [ORGANIZATION] being uprooted from their new lives and sent back to an extremely unstable homeland. Some migrants are too frightened to risk remaining in the country and have tried to escape across the [PERSON]-Canada border8seeking asylum in a second country of refuge. PERSON3 herself is supporting family members back in [ORGANIZATION], where her mother and cousins still live. In communities of extended family networks, she adds, We dont see only brothers and sisters, we see cousins, we see neighbors. If youre here, everybody depends on you. I have a classmate from high school, she has six children, when she calls meI have to send her something. Its not only family, you [PERSON], its everybody. The DATE19 departure window does buy the workers a bittersweet reprieve, though It gives them just enough time to make it to the next round of contract talks in [LOCATION]. In fact, employers in [ORGANIZATION] and other major ORG9 destination cities are heavily dependent on [ORGANIZATION]an migrantsif all these workers were to lose their legal status and employment authorization, according to one projection by ORG16, it would lead to massive job displacement and business-turnover costs of nearly 60 million.

This financial capture allowed banks to transfer private risk to the federal government through FHAs federally backed loans. A benefit of this outcome is that cheaper mortgage credit became more accessible, driving investor demand for more mortgages, because capital was so richly rewarded, it increased banks profits.61 These profits extended to the government sponsored enterprises, and because of the markets manipulation, [LOCATION] homeowners received mortgages with low down payments, reduced interest rates, and extended terms driving segregated affordable housing developments in suburban communities across the nation and limiting prosperity to [LOCATION]s.62 The ongoing impact is that [LOCATION] individuals typically breathe less toxic air, have a stronger revenue base to fund education and other critical community infrastructure needs such as parks and recreation."

portland,2022-02-22T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,OPB,"homeless, homelessness, affordable housing","Legislative plans could repair roads in rural [ORGANIZATION] , promote energy efficiency, help the homeless","If their plans go through, some roads and bridges in rural [ORGANIZATION] are likely to be repaired, sewer systems could be improved and waits to get into residential mental health facilities could shorten. Homeowners who want to install solar systems may get rebates and those who lack job skills are likely to be offered training programs to build careers in health care, construction and manufacturing. People who are homeless may get access to temporary housing while apartment dwellers will get financial help to install air conditioning units and cooling centers will be created to keep people safe during heatwaves. Lawmakers have had more money to spend this session. A state forecast increased the budget by nearly 1 billion from unexpected tax revenue. And in a relatively novel approach, the majority Democrats have handed 100 million to their Republican colleagues to spend as they decide. The impact is expected to be most profound in rural - and Republican - corners of the state. Rural [ORGANIZATION] was an area that we looked at and said this is an area that we wanted to target investment in terms of infrastructure and economic development, [ORGANIZATION] said during an online news conference with reporters on [ORGANIZATION] [TIME]. Its [LOCATION] when Republicans and Democrats can come together for the good of all [ORGANIZATION]ians. This money will help move forward important public projects throughout [ORGANIZATION]. - Sen. [PERSON], [PERSON] The Democratic majority gave Republicans budget-writing authority to decide how to spend the money. That move, first reported1 by [ORGANIZATION], marks a step towards more civil relations between the two parties, which have been combative and fraught with suspicion and anger in the past. Republican leaders said they were initially suspicious of the offer, wondering what Democrats wanted in return. [ORGANIZATION] said the budget offer wasnt an olive branch but rather a practical move because Republicans represent many of the rural areas of the state. There are absolutely no strings attached, [ORGANIZATION] said. This is about making meaningful change in communities across the state. Republican leaders, who reached out to their legislators for priorities, welcomed the opportunity to have a say in the budget. Its [LOCATION] when Republicans and Democrats can come together for the good of all [ORGANIZATION]ians, ORG1 Republican leader [PERSON], [PERSON], said in a statement. This money will help move forward important public projects throughout [ORGANIZATION]. The group that worked on proposals included lawmakers from the coast, [ORGANIZATION] and the central, southern, [ORGANIZATION] and north-[ORGANIZATION] areas of the state, according to a news release. These will be transformational investments to improve rural communities for generations and create hundreds of good paying jobs, Rep. [PERSON], D-GPE2, said in the release. He worked with Republicans on spending plans. [ORGANIZATION] said Republicans, who initially identified more than 100 million in spending, are scaling back some of their proposals. Details are still being worked out, but legislative sources said money will go toward flood prevention, [STREET] safety, sewer improvement, wastewater and drinking water treatment and broadband support. Energy efficiency, climate-related projects [ORGANIZATION] climate change is one of the Democrats priorities. Theyre earmarking 100 million for energy efficiency improvements, solar energy, drought relief and helping [ORGANIZATION]ians stay cool during heat waves. Drought, fire and other climate disruptions put the most vulnerable [ORGANIZATION]ians at great risk, Sen. [PERSON], D-GPE3 said in a release. By investing in resilient homes and clean energy, we can build safer and healthier communities, reduce the cost of energy for consumers and create good paying jobs. The package includes bills aimed at keeping [ORGANIZATION]ians cool when temperatures rise to life-threatening levels. Proposals expected to pass include money for cooling and warming centers and a provision that would allow renters to put air conditioning units in apartment windows. Part of the 100 million will be used for sewer upgrades, wastewater treatment and drinking water treatment, while other money will go towards helping [ORGANIZATION]ians impacted by wildfires and drought. The state - and the [PERSON] - is heading into DATE2 of drought, which has left reservoirs low and sparked [ORGANIZATION]. Weather forecasters expect [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] and the return of hot, dry temperatures in [LOCATION]. The [ORGANIZATION] rain could help prevent [ORGANIZATION] DATE9. The 100 million in climate-related spending includes adding more money to a fund that helps low-income [ORGANIZATION]ians repair and renovate their homes to make them safer and more energy efficient, according to a news release. [ORGANIZATION] fund was established in the [LOCATION]0 session, and, according to Rep. [PERSON], D-GPE4, is part of a commitment by lawmakers to help people whove been the most affected by the climate crisis while promoting clean energy. [ORGANIZATION] writers also plan to set aside money for another program established [LOCATION]1. Lawmakers budgeted 10 million for the [ORGANIZATION] Solar and [ORGANIZATION], which allows low-income homeowners to receive 60 rebates of the cost of a solar system. Other homeowners qualify for a 40 rebate. Legislators also plan to invest in electric vehicles by spending money on charging networks for trucks and provide consumers new incentives to [STREET] electric vehicles. As part of their focus on emission reduction, a task force will look at ways of reducing emissions from homes and buildings, the second main source of climate pollution. A focus on public safety [ORGANIZATION] said details of plans to spend more than 100 million on public safety will be released [LOCATION]2. Some of it will be focused on behavioral health support, [ORGANIZATION] said. There will also be a focus on victim supports. A bill to help behavioral health residential providers recruit and retain staff moved out [PERSON] and is now with [LOCATION]. The bill includes about 200 million, with increased reimbursement rates for [ORGANIZATION] patients. Its not clear the spending on that has been whittled down. Behavioral health providers have said they need 200 million to stay afloat. Another public safety bill before the [ORGANIZATION] would give money to community groups for intervention and violence prevention. [ORGANIZATION] said lawmakers realize that they need to focus on that to break the chain of violence, adding that the public safety initiatives had bipartisan support. Were hoping to have a fairly substantial package released on [LOCATION]3, [ORGANIZATION] said. Homelessness and affordable housing are also Democratic and Republican priorities, and both sides are keen to raise the standard of living. Proposals are in the works to increase tax credits for low-income [ORGANIZATION]ians and spend tens of millions of dollars on grants for child care providers to help them hire more staff and expand their programs.

Overtime for farmworkers One of the most controversial bills this session is a proposal to pay overtime to agriculture workers after [TIME] [DATE]. ORG7 [PERSON] passed out of [ORGANIZATION] on a party line vote, and is now in [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] said it would soon move out of that committee to [LOCATION], which works on the budget. He said Democrats hope to get to a point where Republicans can support the proposal. It would phase in time and a half pay for farmworkers after a [TIME] [DATE] over [LOCATION]4, with tax credits to employers for [LOCATION]5. Republicans proposed allowing employers to essentially have a break for paying overtime for [LOCATION]6, which would cover peak seasons. [ORGANIZATION] said the Democrats convened listening sessions with Republicans to hear their position on the bill and formed a joint committee in the ORG1, with another to be announced on [LOCATION]7 that will try to broker a deal. [ORGANIZATION] said Democratic lawmakers are trying to understand how we can get to a Yes. Farmworkers have been denied overtime since the [DATE] federal Fair Labor Standards Act. Their supporters say the law was racist, originally targeting Black farmworkers in the LOC2, and that they deserve to get overtime like other workers. Republicans have insisted that the proposal will put family farms out of business and prompt corporations to scoop them up. [ORGANIZATION] indicated that Democratic leaders are seeking a better working relationship with Republicans. The philosophy of our office and what weve communicated and what our office believes is to honor and respect the Republicans and their right to be able to protest on the floor by reading bills, [ORGANIZATION] said, referring to a process requiring a full reading of sometimes lengthy bills.  1  2"

In contrast, prices continue to slowly increase in more affordable housing markets such as those in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], and [ORGANIZATION]. This difference is a result of the amount of rural land-use regulation in these states. All of these urban areas limit low-density dePERSON0lopment using urban-growth boundaries, concurrency requirements, or similar policies, thus making housing both expensiPERSON0 and volatile. [PERSON] rural regulations are so strict that the [ORGANIZATION] census3 found that 95 percent of the states residents are confined to 5 percent of the states land area, and the urban areas in which they liPERSON0 are twice as dense as the aPERSON0rage density of urban areas in the rest of the country. MoreoPERSON0r, under [PERSON] law, counties cant reduce those restrictions by, for example, expanding urban-growth boundaries unless they spend tens of millions of dollars writing environmental impact reports, which no local goPERSON0rnment is willing to do. In addition, it can take [DATE] or more to get a permit to build one home, much less the tens of thousands of new homes that [PERSON] needs [DATE]. This makes it nearly impossible for dePERSON0lopers to respond to changes in the demand for new homes. Instead, such changes result in wild shifts in home prices. There are minimal land-use restrictions in the rural lands around these urban areas. These keeps housing affordable and allows builders to meet flucuating demands. In states such as [ORGANIZATION] where there is little rural land-use regulation [ORGANIZATION] doesnt [ORGANIZATION] allow zoning in unincorporated areas, the supply of housing is fluid and can meet new demands whether the population is growing fast or slow. When demand increases, builders build more homes when it declines, they reduce their rate of production. This minimizes price fluctuations. As [PERSON] explained [PERSON], the seed of the [ORGANIZATION] financial crisis was the decline in housing prices in restricted areas after [PERSON]  a decline that the mortgage bond buyers and ratings companies did not expect. But prices in unrestricted areas didnt decline until after [ORGANIZATION]. In other words, the volatility of prices in restricted areas caused the crisis price declines in unrestricted areas, if they happened at all, were a result of the crisis. Contrary to what some may hope5, the recent decline in housing prices wont make housing more affordable and it certainly wont increase homeownership rates. This is partly because declines in home prices are likely to be accompanied by increased unemployment and reduced personal incomes. But, in addition, the PERSON0ry fact that prices are so volatile makes homeownership less desirable. Volatility makes a home purchase a risky inPERSON0stment because people cant predict when they might get a new job elsewhere and need to moPERSON0. Just as those who bought homes in [PERSON] in [PERSON] would be in financial straits if they had to sell in [PERSON], people who bought in [ORGANIZATION] may be disappointed if they haPERSON0 to sell in [LOCATION]. No wonder [PERSON] homeownership rate is lower DATE8 than at any time since DATE9 and is the 49th lowest6 of any state in the nation. The War on Homeownership Many of those who do own homes in [PERSON] sighed in relief with the death7 of [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON], which would haPERSON0 eliminated all zoning restrictions9 within a half mile of any rail transit station and a quarter mile of major bus stops. That included nearly all of [PERSON] and most of GPE6, GPE7, and other major cities. Yet the fight isnt oPERSON0r as homeowners now haPERSON0 to confront [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON], which would mandate increased densities in neighborhoods throughout [PERSON] cities. Although the details of the two bills are different, SB 330 has been called the evil [LOCATION] of SB [DATE]. Nearly 82 percent12 of occupied single-family homes in this country are occupied by their owners. Nearly 87 percent of occupied multifamily homes are occupied by renters. This is partly due to preference and partly because single-family homes are more conduciPERSON0 to ownership than multifamily. Policies against single-family homes are therefore also policies against homeownership. The dual premises behind these bills, as well as an [ORGANIZATION] bill that would ban single-family zoning13, are that single-family zoning makes housing more expensiPERSON0 and that multifamily housing is more affordable than single-family. Neither of these assumptions are true. Low-Density Housing Is Affordable If single-family zoning made housing expensiPERSON0, then [PERSON] and [PERSON]0, which haPERSON0 single-family zoning, would be significantly more expensiPERSON0 than [PERSON]1, which does not. In fact, the median home in the [PERSON]-Ft. Worth urban area is a little more expensiPERSON0 than in the [PERSON]1 urban area, but in [PERSON]0 it is less expensiPERSON0. Most of the differences are attributable to differences in income according to the [DATE]0 [ORGANIZATION] SurPERSON0y, the ratio of median home prices to median family incomes value-to-income ratio in all three regions is about the same. Housing costs are much higher in regions with rural land-use regulation. Source ORG0. Across the nation, the vast majority of cities haPERSON0 single-family zoning, yet most housing in those cities is not significantly more expensiPERSON0 than in [PERSON]0 or [PERSON]1. What makes housing expensiPERSON0 in places such as [PERSON], [PERSON]2, [ORGANIZATION], and [PERSON]3 is sePERSON0re restrictions on rural dePERSON0lopment, which haPERSON0 limited the supply of new homes. Density Is ExpensiPERSON0 While single-family housing isnt the cause of housing becoming expensiPERSON0, neither is multifamily housing the solution to housing affordability problems. The idea that density is more affordable is contradicted by the fact that [PERSON] urban areas are already the densest in the nation at 7,300 people per square mile in [DATE]0, the [ORGANIZATION] urban area is the nations densest, followed by [PERSON]-GPE6 at 6,800, [PERSON]6 at 6,300, with [PERSON]7 only number four at 5,[DATE]0. The densities of regions with urban-growth boundaries haPERSON0 significantly increased, which has only made housing less affordable. Source [DATE]1 census and [DATE]0 [ORGANIZATION] SurPERSON0y. The rising density of [PERSON] urban areas since [DATE]1 has been accompanied by rising housing prices, not more affordable housing. The population density of the [PERSON]6 urban area has grown by 70 percent since [DATE]1, while the areas value-to-income ratio has grown 235 percent, which means it is less than a third as affordable as it was before the growth-management plans that restricted rural dePERSON0lopment were put into effect in the mid-[DATE]1s. In general, affordability is negatiPERSON0ly correlated with density, and large increases in density are always accompanied by large declines in affordability. This is because housing costs are a function of land prices and construction costs, and land prices are higher in denser areas while the costs per square foot of building dense housing are greater than single-family homes.The aPERSON0rage price of an acre of land in regions with rural land-use constraints is much greater than in regions without. [PERSON], PERSON2, and [ORGANIZATION], [DATE]014. Based on a [DATE]0 study15, land costs in urban areas with restrictions on rural dePERSON0lopment are typically fiPERSON0 to ten times greater than in areas with no such restrictions. This means housing densities haPERSON0 to be fiPERSON0 to ten times greater than in single-family neighborhoods in order for the land costs per housing unit to be as affordable as they are in areas with minimal rural restrictions.Because they use more steel, cement, and other expensiPERSON0 materials, construction costs of mid-rise and high-rise buildings are much higher than for low-rise. PERSON4 actually expressed costs as a percent of the cost of a single-family home, but since basic construction costs start at around 100 a square foot, I conPERSON0rted to dollars. PERSON4 also said high-rise costs were 5.5 to 7.5 times low-rise, so I aPERSON0raged to 6.5. But construction of housing at such densities costs far more than construction of single-family homes. According to [PERSON] dePERSON0loper [PERSON], building 20 units per acre three-story townhomes costs [DATE] percent more16 per square foot than one- and two-story single-family homes. Building 26 units per acre four-story townhomes costs twice as much. Building [DATE] units per acre fiPERSON0-stories, he says, costs three to four times as much, while 100 units per acre in high-rise housing costs 5.5 to 7.5 times as much as single-family homes. So when officials say they want to make housing more affordable by building denser housing, they arent talking about building 2,400-square-foot homes, the aPERSON0rage size of new single-family homes17 in [ORGANIZATION]. Instead, they are talking about apartments that are less than half that size the aPERSON0rage size of new multifamily rental units in [ORGANIZATION] was under 1,100 square feet, and many affordable housing plans call for building apartments that are as small as 660 square feet18. The Planning Conspiracy Although affordable housing is the latest excuse for plans to increase housing densities, urban planners supported densification long before affordable housing became an issue. In the past, they haPERSON0 offered many objections to so-called sprawl, meaning low-density suburban dePERSON0lopment, but all of those objections haPERSON0 proPERSON0n specious.Only about a third of the nations agricultural lands are used for growing crops, and little more than half of those lands are used for the food we eat. Ending ethanol subsidies would do far more for protecting rural lands than attempting to control urban growth. They say sprawl threatens farms and open space. But all urban areas in [PERSON]8 occupy just 3.0 percent of the country. Meanwhile, a third of the nations land, or about 1.1 billion acres, is agricultural lands, and only a third of is actually used for growing crops. Since per-acre yields of most major crops are growing faster19 than the nations population, the need for croplands is actually declining. Sadly, anti-sprawl policies destroyed [PERSON]2s agricultural industry because they made housing so expensiPERSON0 that farmers couldnt afford to pay workers, so the number of acres used for growing crops has declined by well oPERSON0r 70 percent. ConPERSON0rting marginal agricultural lands to urban lands can greatly increase the nations productivity, especially by making housing more affordable. They say sprawl contributes to congestion, but actually it is density that causes congestion. The most congested urban areas in [PERSON]8  GPE7, [PERSON]7, [PERSON]9, and so forth  are also the densest. Low-density dePERSON0lopment represents employers and families who are escaping from the dense, congested parts of urban areas. They say sprawl leads to too much driving and therefore wastes energy and produces excessiPERSON0 greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, a detailed analysis20 by [PERSON] of the UniPERSON0rsity of [PERSON], [PERSON] concluded that the effects of density and urban form were too small to be useful in saving energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. They say Millennials dont want to liPERSON0 in single-family homes. In fact, all the data show that, not only do most Millennials aspire to liPERSON0 in low-density [LOCATION], most of them actually liPERSON0 in the suburbs22. The hidden agenda of many city officials is increasing their tax r[ORGANIZATION]ues. DePERSON0lopments outside of existing cities will not pay taxes to those cities, especially in states that haPERSON0 made it difficult for cities to annex land. Urban-growth boundaries and other rural land-use regulation are merely another [STREET] for cities to insure that they get the taxes from new dePERSON0lopment. Zoning and Property Rights Some people support bills to eliminate single-family zoning because they see them as a restoration of property rights. But people buy homes in single-family neighborhoods expecting that either zoning or protectiPERSON0 coPERSON0nants will insure that the house next to theirs isnt turned into an apartment, shopping center, graPERSON0l pit, or crack house. In contrast to farmers who strongly object to their farms being downzoned to pr[ORGANIZATION]t future dePERSON0lopment, it is the homeowners themselPERSON0s who most strongly object to the elimination of zoning. In his book, Zoning and Property Rights23, libertarian [ORGANIZATION] argues that zoning represents a form of collectiPERSON0 property rights, in which ePERSON0ryone agrees to limit the use of their land on the condition that their neighbors do the same. In the absence of zoning, dePERSON0lopers haPERSON0 found that protectiPERSON0 coPERSON0nants increase the value of the homesites they sell. Historically, such coPERSON0nants preceded zoning, and zoning was just a [STREET] to gain the same benefits for neighborhoods that were already built. [DATE]4, almost ePERSON0ryone living in a single-family neighborhood bought their homes after zoning or coPERSON0nants were put in [STREET], so no one has actually lost any property rights. To think that eliminating single-family zoning might be one step towards eliminating all zoning betrays a naiPERSON0 view of the politics of urban growth. Housing and Race Proponents of the redePERSON0lopment of single-family neighborhoods to higher densities call themselPERSON0s environmentalists [ORGANIZATION] as they accuse opponents of being racists. In fact, it is the proponents of rural land-use restrictions whose policies are racist. When measured by comparing the actual moPERSON0ment of black people compared with total population growth, the [PERSON]-GPE6 urban area is the most racist region of the country. Source [ORGANIZATION] SurPERSON0y. Thanks to the high housing prices caused by such restrictions, the number of blacks living in the [PERSON]-GPE6 urban area has fallen by 10 percent since [PERSON], while the number living in the [ORGANIZATION] urban area has fallen by 3 percent. Meanwhile, the number living in [ORGANIZATION]0, [PERSON]-Ft. Worth, [PERSON]0, and other urban areas that lack rural land-use restrictions has grown faster than the oPERSON0r population of those areas. Conclusions People in nearly ePERSON0ry age and income class aspire to liPERSON0 in single-family homes. Destroying single-family neighborhoods to make housing affordable not only isnt necessary, it wont work. Urban areas and states with unaffordable housing should instead abolish restrictions on dePERSON0lopment of lands outside of existing urban areas. Such a change would do far more to make housing affordable and restore property rights than focusing on single-family zoning.

Prices are high in these areas because of urban-growth boundaries or other restrictions on development of rural areas at the urban fringes of these states and regions. Collectively known as growth management, such restrictions increase the price of developable land, allow cities to impose development restrictions without fear that developers will go outside the cities, and increase labor costs as home construction workers fight to find affordable housing along with everyone else. Instead of abolishing these restrictions, the people who imposed and support them want to rezone neighborhoods of single-family homes for higher densities. [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] have both abolished single-family zoning. [ORGANIZATION] has proposed to do so in transit corridors. Yet there is no evidence that single-family zoning makes housing expensive or that building multifamily housing will make housing more affordable. Rather than debate the evidence, advocates of density have resorted to calling supporters of single-family zoning names such as NIMBYs not in my backyard and racists. This paper will show that most [ORGANIZATION]0ns live in neighborhoods of single-family homes because they want to and that their preferences are both legitimate and not a threat to housing affordability. [ORGANIZATION], most urban planners wanted to help people move out of dense, inner-city [PERSON] and into lower-density single-family neighborhoods that they thought were safer and healthier. In [LOCATION], that goal was being achieved thanks not to urban planners but to affordable, mass-produced automobiles such as the Model T [ORGANIZATION], which gave working-class families affordable mobility to reach affordable housing in the suburbs. Yet the exodus of working-class people from the cities led some planning advocates to question the goal, starting in class-conscious GPE3. Socialist [PERSON] was upset that people whose tastes in clothing and music were different from his own could be seen cackling insanely in the woods and upon seashores and river banks, lying in every attitude of undress and inelegant squalor. Clearly, thought [ORGANIZATION], the extension of towns must be stopped. English planner [ORGANIZATION] offered a solution in a [ORGANIZATION] book called Town and Countryside4 he proposed that the government build great new blocks of flats which will house a considerable portion of the population. This idea was supported by Swiss architect PERSON4, who proposed in [ORGANIZATION] that all urban residents be housed in what he called GPE4 of high-rise housing that allotted an average of 153 square feet of floor space per person or about 600 square feet for a family of four. In [DATE], the socialist-leaning British [ORGANIZATION] passed a law inspired by PERSON5 ideas called the Town ...untry Planning Act6. This law nationalized the development rights to rural land landowners were allowed to keep their land, but they could only develop it with permission from the government and they were required to pay a fee equal to the increase in land value resulting from the new development. Naturally, this greatly dampened rural development. In its [STREET], the government built hundreds of high-rise housing projects. This law has been described as a natural extension7 of the feudal system that prevailed in [PERSON] after [PERSON] successfully invaded the country in DATE5. Even [ORGANIZATION], less than half a percent of English families own at least two-thirds8 of the country. To compensate these aristocrats and oligarchs, the [ORGANIZATION] paid them and continues to pay them agricultural subsidies that [ORGANIZATION] average about 150 an [ORGANIZATION] and is actually more10 than landowners earn from farming. GPE6 followed the international trend of building high-rise housing for low-income people with passage of the Housing Act of [DATE], which led to huge urban renewal programs aiming to demolish low-income neighborhoods that planners called slums. When GPE7 planned to use urban-renewal funds to turn [ORGANIZATION] into high-rise housing, architecture critic [ORGANIZATION] and her neighbors successfully stopped the project. She subsequently wrote The Death and Life of Great [ORGANIZATION]0n Cities12, arguing that the mid-rise four- to five-story housing in [ORGANIZATION] wasnt a slum and in fact was a vibrant neighborhood. PERSON8 managed to persuade a new generation of planners that trying to house everyone in high-rises was a bad idea. Instead, they want to build mid-rise housing like that found in [ORGANIZATION] to house everyone or, at least, far more people than [ORGANIZATION]. All development13 should be in the form of compact, walkable neighborhoods, argued [PERSON], which also wants the [ORGANIZATION] of sprawling suburbs into such compact neighborhoods. Compact is another [STREET] of saying high-density, which in [PERSON]ism terms generally means mid-rise developments. Under their vision, no one would be allowed to live in low-density, single-family neighborhoods. [PERSON] for Keeping Densities Low Yet there are good reasons why more than 60 percent of occupied homes in [PERSON] are single-family structures detached from other houses. Single-family attached, or rowhouses, make up another 6 percent. The first is less congestion, as low densities mean there arent enough people to create meaningful congestion. Adding multifamily housing to a neighborhood whose [STREET] network has been designed to support single-family homes is going to make congestion significantly worse. Second, single-family neighborhoods tend to have less crime, not because criminals are more likely to live in multifamily housing but because multifamily housing tends to be more inviting to burglars and other criminals. After comparing crime rates with architectural features on thousands of city blocks, architect PERSON9 concluded that housing with a preponderance of common areas were more likely to attract crime than housing with lots of private land because its easier to identify and exclude people who dont belong from private land than from the commons. A more recent study16 found that [PERSON] developments attracted more crime and were several times more expensive to police than areas with more private yards. [PERSON]0 book, Creating Defensible Space, is available for free download17 from ORG2. [PERSON]1 also found that alleys attract crime because they offer burglars relatively hidden entrances to homes while [ORGANIZATION] deter crime by giving criminals fewer exits from a crime scene. New urbanists support alleys while they oppose [ORGANIZATION]. A third reason people like single-family homes is privacy. Homes that dont share a common wall with other houses will be quieter and private yards are mini-parks that people can customize to their own preferences, whether as swimming pools, patios, childrens play areas, gardens, or a combination of several of these. Finally, people prefer low-rise housing because it is affordable, at least on a per-square-foot basis. Theres a good reason why postwar homebuilders such as [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]2 concentrated on building single-family homes to provide affordable housing for returning soldiers and their families. These homes were small by [ORGANIZATION]s standards  typically 750 to 1,200 square feet  but they offered opportunities for expansion that couldnt be found in multifamily housing. For all these reasons, it isnt surprising that even surveys conducted by [PERSON] find that the vast majority of [ORGANIZATION]0ns prefer or aspire to live in low-density neighborhoods18 that exclude multifamily housing. For example, a DATE8 [PERSON]ist survey found that 73 percent of [ORGANIZATION]0ns prefer suburban developments with large lots and wide streets to residential urban areas, including narrower streets, sidewalks, and shared recreational areas. Other studies found as many as 83 percent preferring single-family homes. The Myth of the Demand for Density Despite these survey results, density advocates have promoted the claim that peoples tastes are changing and that manyspecifically Millennials and retiring [PERSON] longer want to live in single-family homes and instead want to live in vibrant inner-city neighborhoods. While there may be some truth to this, the numbers appear small and it isnt clear that there is a shortage of dense neighborhoods to meet this demand. In DATE9, a ORG6 planning professor named [PERSON]3 published a paper19 claiming that so many people would want to live in high-density housing by [LOCATION]0 that [PERSON] would have a surplus of 22 million single-family homes. As reported20 in ORG7, the suburbs would become giant slums or ghost towns. [PERSON]4 did not say how he reached this conclusion, only that it was based on his interpretation of the same surveys that found that 73 to 83 percent of [ORGANIZATION]0ns preferred to live in a single-family home. He did urge urban planners to reshape the landscape by promoting construction of more high-density housing to meet the demand that he fantasized would exist in [LOCATION]0. [PERSON]4 went on to write reports for various cities and regions predicting low demand for single-family homes and a high demand for multifamily. For example, his [LOCATION]1 report21 for the [PERSON]-[ORGANIZATION] predicted that the demand for rowhouses and multifamily dwellings in the area would rise from 426,000 [ORGANIZATION] to 619,000 in [LOCATION]2, while the demand for new single-family homes would grow by just 25,000.Because high-density housing costs more to build, the price is generally greater than that of low-density housing even though the demand for high-density is lower. While it is difficult to imagine how even the best supply-and-demand analysis could be accurate enough to predict housing needs [LOCATION]3 into the future to the nearest 1,000 homes, [PERSON]4 didnt even attempt to do such an analysis. In fact, his report betrays no understand of the concepts of supply and demand at all, and instead he cites himself as the sole source for much of his projections. Contrary to his use of the term, demand is not a single quantity, like 619,000, but a relationship between prices and quantities. To say the demand is 619,000 without specifying a price is like saying someone is traveling at 5 miles per without specifying whether that is per hour a fast walker, per minute an airplane, or per second FAC0. The fundamental problem with claims that people want to live in dense cities is that they completely ignore price. They ask people, Would you rather live in a walkable neighborhood or one where you have to [STREET] everywhere? when they should ask, Would you rather pay 400,000 for an 1,100-square-foot condo where you can walk to a high-priced limited-selection grocery store or 200,000 for a 2,200-square-foot single-family home where you can [STREET] to several supermarkets that are fiercely competing with each other to get your business? As revealed by where most [ORGANIZATION]0ns actually live, most would choose the latter. The Myth that Growth Management Doesnt Increase Housing Prices Even before [PERSON]4s DATE9 paper, some metropolitan planners aimed to significantly reduce the share of people in their regions living in single-family homes. In [LOCATION]4, ORG9 regional planning organizationset a target of reducing the share of households in single-family homes from 65 percent, which it had been in [LOCATION]5, to 41 percent by [LOCATION]2. The main tools used to achieve this goal were the urban-growth boundary, which made land inside the boundary much more expensive rezoning of several dozen neighborhoods of single-family homes to multifamily housing a minimum density zoning requirement that all new construction had to be at least 80 percent of the maximum density allowed in any zone and subsidies to developers of high-density housing.The cost of an acre of land in a growth-managed region is typically 2 to 15 times greater than an acre in areas without growth management. [PERSON] cost is lower than LOC2 because [PERSON] has at least added some land to its urban-growth boundary as the population has grown, while [PERSON]0 and [ORGANIZATION] regions have not. Source [PERSON]0. By [LOCATION]6, [ORGANIZATION]s [ORGANIZATION] reported23 that it was almost impossible to buy or build a new house in the [PERSON] area with a decent-sized backyard and that this had nothing to do with demand but was a result of deliberate policies. Meanwhile, median home prices in the [PERSON] area have increased from 2.0 times median family incomes in [LOCATION]5 to 4.2 times incomes in [LOCATION]7. However, as of [LOCATION]7more than halfway to [LOCATION]259 percent of [PERSON]-area households still lived in single-family homes, well short of the [LOCATION]2 target of 41 percent. Like [PERSON]0, [PERSON]1, and [PERSON]2, [PERSON] is going through a much-discussed24 housing crisis25. Yet few have proposed to abolish the urban-growth boundary to improve affordability and planners still insist that the boundary didnt make housing expensive. To support this claim, they point to studies26 such as one finding that [PERSON] home prices were no higher than those in [PERSON]3 and [PERSON]0, claiming those regions lacked urban-growth boundaries. In fact, [PERSON]0 has had one since [LOCATION]9 and [PERSON]3 since [ORGANIZATION]0, and both had practiced some form of growth management before those dates. Meanwhile, regions that are growing as fast or faster than [PERSON] but that truly do not have urban-growth boundaries, such as [PERSON]4, [PERSON]5, and [PERSON]6 not to mention [PERSON]7, [PERSON]8, and [PERSON]9 are far more affordable than [PERSON].Construction costs are higher in growth-managed areas largely because labor costs are higher as construction workers have to pay more for their own housing. These costs include only construction and not land or permitting costs permitting can easily add 100 per square foot or more to the cost of homes in growth-managed regions. Source [URL]29. Prices shown are for a two-story, 2,000-square-foot home with wood siding. Partly because of the efforts of planners in [PERSON] and other regions practicing growth management, the nation is facing a [LOCATION], not a surplus, of single-family homes. This is forcing people into multifamily housing not because it is their preference but because of the artificial scarcity of more desirable housing. The Myth That Single-Family Zoning Makes Housing Unaffordable Instead of abolishing the urban-growth boundaries that have made housing expensive, planners have demonized single-family zoning, claiming, among other things, that it is racist31. While a few early zoning codes were racist in nature, if we got rid of everything that was ever used by racists, it would mean an end to public schools, churches, restaurants, transit buses, and drinking fountains, and many other things. Until it was abolished in [PERSON], virtually every major city in [ORGANIZATION]0 other than [PERSON]9 had single-family zoning, yet it didnt significantly increase housing prices so long as builders could find vacant land for new housing. It was only when urban-growth boundaries and similar growth-management tools limit the amount of that vacant land that housing becomes unaffordable. The Myth that Density Is AffordableThere is a strong negative correlation between housing affordability and population density. Shown here are the densities and price-to-income ratios for the 59 largest urban areas in [PERSON] the correlation coefficient is 0.82. Source [ORGANIZATION]0n Community Survey. The corollary to the claim that single-family zoning made housing unaffordable is the claim that increasing densities will make it affordable again. This is belied by a comparison of urban densities with their affordabilities higher densities are almost always less affordable than lower. [ORGANIZATION]1, one of the densest urban areas32 in the world, is also the one of the least affordable33. In [PERSON], both the densest cities, such as [ORGANIZATION]2 and [PERSON]1, and the densest urban areas, such as [PERSON]2, [PERSON]1-Oakland, [ORGANIZATION]4, [ORGANIZATION]5, and [ORGANIZATION]2, also tend to be the least affordable. The correlation isnt perfect, but in general density is less affordable both because both land prices in dense areas and the costs of constructing dense housing are higher.[PERSON]3 says the extra cost of building mid-rise compared with low-rise apartments is greater than the extra cost of building a custom vs. an economy home, while the extra cost of building high-rise is greater than the extra cost of building a luxury home. Planners misuse these data to claim that people must value density more because they are paying more to live in it. This shows more ignorance about how supply and demand works due to its higher costs, the supply curve for dense housing is lower to the left of the supply curve for low-density housing, so even if the demand curve for dense housing is lower, the price at the intersection of supply and demand can be higher. The Myth That Single-Family Zoning Takes Away Property Rights Urban planners have persuaded some property-rights advocates to support densification on the claim that single-family zoning violates property rights. [PERSON]5, of [PERSON]4, supports state preemptions35 of single-family zoning in [ORGANIZATION] to make housing more affordable. Her work never seems to mention the urban-growth boundaries that have truly made housing unaffordable, and she has even argued that the [PERSON]1 Bay Area has run out of land for housing and therefore can only grow more densely. In fact, only about 17 percent of the region has been developed and most of the rest would be available for development were it not outside of an urban-growth boundary. Property rights have been described as a bundle of sticks. One stick, for example, is whether or not landowners can sell their land. At one time, most land in [ORGANIZATION] and even some in [PERSON] was entailed36, meaning the owners couldnt sell it but could only bequeath it to their heirs. Another stick is whether or not the government can take land by eminent domain. Fee [DATE] land titles in [PERSON] allow this, but a few people have an allodial title38 that is protected from both eminent domain and property taxes. Given these different sticks, one possible stick could say, I wont develop my property beyond certain limits provided everyone around me is subject to the same limits. That is what single-family zoning is meant to emulate, and opponents of legislation to eliminate such zoning argue39 that doing so would violate their property rights, that is, the stick that limits development to protect the stability of the neighborhood. As I show in [ORGANIZATION]0n Nightmare40, urban homeownership rates in [PERSON] were very low in [ORGANIZATION]1, not because homes were expensivein [ORGANIZATION]s dollars, a modest home with indoor plumbing cost about 25,000 while a large upper-middle-class home might cost [DATE] because people didnt want to put money into a house that might end up having a gravel pit, brickyard, or tenement for a neighbor. By [ORGANIZATION]2, developers discovered that buyers would pay more for homes or building sites if the lot and its neighbors had protective covenants forbidding anything but single-family homes. Such covenants soon became common. Zoning was developed to provide similar protections for existing neighborhoods of single-family homes and most such zoning merely affirmed whatever land uses already existed in an area. A few early zoning codes zoned areas that were used for industrial purposes for housing. For example, [PERSON]2 zoned a brickyard for residential uses, and the [PERSON]5 decision41 affirming this ordinance was a mistake as it violated the landowners property rights. But these were exceptions. Covenants and zoning led to a rapid increase in homeownership rates. Rates grew by more than 40 percent between [DATE] World War II and [ORGANIZATION]3, by which time almost every city in [ORGANIZATION]0 except [PERSON]9 and its suburb [ORGANIZATION]6 had zoned all the land within their borders. Since [ORGANIZATION]3, most housing developments on unzoned land outside of cities has been supported by protective covenants. What this means is that almost no one [ORGANIZATION] has lost their property rights because the single-family home they own was zoned for single-family uses after they bought it. To the contrary, most consider the single-family nature of their neighborhood to be a property right itself. Some neighborhoods in [PERSON]9 dont have protective covenants, either because they were never written for those neighborhoods or because they lapsed due to disuse. In lieu of zoning, [PERSON]9 allows residents of such neighborhoods to petition their neighbors, and if 75 percent agree, they can write their own covenants. The rule requires 75 percent rather than unanimity to get around the holdout [LOCATION], in which one or a few landowners demands payment from the rest in excess of the true value of potential development on their property. Eliminating single-family zoning wouldnt be a problem if residents were allowed to protect their neighborhoods by writing their own covenants using a process similar to [PERSON]9s. But urban planners want to be able to impose higher densities on such neighborhoods, so they would never support that. Conclusions Growth management, not single-family zoning, is what has made housing expensive in some parts of the country. Eliminating single-family zoning wont make housing affordable in such areas because it wont reduce land costs and higher-density housing costs more per square foot than single-family housing. Residents of single-family neighborhoods have good reasons to object to rezoning of their neighborhoods for higher densities. In fact, rather than see such rezoning as a restoration of their property rights, they see it as a taking of their rights. People who are truly interested in making housing more affordable should work on abolishing growth boundaries and other growth-management policies, not on eliminating single-family zoning.

Those risks are identified in a map showing statewide environmental public health data from ORG2. The [PERSON]1 Environmental Disparities Map9 reveals that both [ORGANIZATION] Valley and [ORGANIZATION] rank high in environmental health disparities such as larger proportions of residents exposed to toxic soot.All of that has consequences. Life expectancy in [ORGANIZATION] Valley is [PERSON] than in wealthier neighborhoods in North [PERSON]0. The longstanding racial and ethnic inequities exemplified in south [PERSON]0 were central to the most significant example to date of the movement to decarbonize [ORGANIZATION] running headlong into aspirations for people of color to be part of the so-called just transition11 to a carbon-free future.Pollution from trucks and other diesel-powered vehicles serving the [INSTITUTION] of [PERSON]0 joins air pollution from steamships and nearby highways to [STREET] up air pollution levels in many pockets of [ORGANIZATION], one of the most racially diverse areas in [ORGANIZATION]. Activists working for what they call a just transition to an economy free of fossil fuels say [PERSON] of inequitably distributed environmental risks demand that people of color and other marginalized communities be protected and even helped by the effort. [ORGANIZATION] how that happened [LOCATION] in [PERSON]1 splintered their organizing efforts in two ballot initiatives [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] designe to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by taxing them. At the heart of the disagreement was whether tax revenues raised from levies on, for example, carbon dioxide emissions from an asphalt plant should be returned to taxpayers, as happens with [PERSON]2 carbon tax or whether those revenues should instead be used to invest in clean-energy jobs and other benefits to communities of color, labor groups and others who can provide broad support at the ballot box.Both measures failed by substantial margins.

Against this backdrop of historic environmental inequity, community groups are calling for explicit corrections as the region transitions to a low-carbon economy, moves that would help bring jobs and vitality to long-marginalized communities. Photo PERSON8 ORG7 is one of many groups across [ORGANIZATION] fighting to move the economy away from fossil fuels to renewables without burdening already-marginalized communities, or leaving those communities out of benefits. For example, they want to protect low-income people from rising transportation and energy bills that could result from climate policies. And they want all communities to have affordable access to cleaner options such as public transit and home retrofits, as well as new jobs in the renewable energy sector.[ORGANIZATION] Sage surveyed15 the community to try to understand what residents thought an equitable transition to renewable energy would look like. The resulting report16 sought to speak the mind of the community. In her outreach, [PERSON]3, climate justice organizer with [ORGANIZATION] Sage, noted that community members were primarily interested in having lower energy bills, having energy-efficient appliances, and keeping a roof over their heads.However, the city had its own ideas about what the south [PERSON]0 community needed. We constantly needed data to back up everything we said, said [PERSON]4. The needs of the community and plans of the city did not align, she said. [ORGANIZATION] Sage was hearing that the community wanted an expansion of public transit, better access to weatherization programs for homes and to build energy-efficient affordable housing. However, the city thought that the [ORGANIZATION] community wanted solar panels and incentives on electric vehicles, [PERSON]4 said. The city tends to think that what works for one community will work for the other, said [PERSON]4. Thats why we needed the report, to really prove what our community was thinking and needing, said [PERSON]4.But will the city listen? Only time will tell. And the scene echoes 300 miles to the south.

Why? In [PERSON], they were not allowed to rent rooms at whites-only motels. Fast-forward to [LOCATION]3 and the [PERSON] is the regional branch office of the [ORGANIZATION], which is working to convert the building into a solar installation project. There arent a whole lot of examples of that in GPE7 right now, PERSON21, the [ORGANIZATION] GPE7Springfield branchs environmental and climate justice coordinator. The branch is doing this through a grant program with [ORGANIZATION] that allows customers to designate a small portion of their utility payment to support the solar installation. Aligning with the national [ORGANIZATION]s Solar Equity Initiative, the branch aims to conduct a demonstration so that the community can learn about clean energy.The [ORGANIZATION] is also a part of a new campaign, [PERSON], a coalition of environmental organizations including ORG13, [ORGANIZATION], 350 GPE7 and [ORGANIZATION] Wildlands. Two main demands of [ORGANIZATION] campaign are to ban the construction of all new fossil fuel infrastructure in GPE7 and levy a fee on polluters such as ORG17, the regions natural-gas utility, to create a fund to help historically marginalized and low-income communities make the switch to renewable energy. This funding mechanism takes inspiration from ORG18, a grant program established by a [ORGANIZATION] ballot initiative. The [PERSON]5 fund is designed to distribute up to 61 million a year in clean energy funding for job training, energy efficiency, renewable energy infrastructure and innovation. It prioritizes low-income residents and communities of color.In [LOCATION]4, [ORGANIZATION] Campaign scored a victory when [ORGANIZATION] rejected [PERSON] proposal to renew a franchise agreement allowing the utility to run its pipes under city rights of [STREET]. Backed by the campaign, the city was trying to incorporate our climate action and carbon reduction goals into their franchise agreement with ORG22, said PERSON22, grassroots organizer of [ORGANIZATION] Wildlands. This renewal would have locked the city into another [LOCATION]5 contract. What was at stake was the legitimacy of our citys climate recovery goals, PERSON23 said. Our coalition was directly responsible for providing our city councilors with the support needed to take ORG22 to task, said PERSON23. Despite this victory, activists like PERSON24 and PERSON23 say much work remains. A ray of hope in state solar initiative? Its going to take a lot of lobbying and government action to enable a so-called just transition that focuses on equity, activists say, but some glimmers of progress are evident. Take the example of rooftop solar installations. An interactive tool created at ORG23 that combines federal data on solar deployment and census data shows that for [PERSON]1 and [PERSON], the upper half of households by income account over 80 of those states residential solar systems.Similar census-enhanced research by [PERSON]s ORG27 recently added another layer to the solar gap racial bias. ORG25 director PERSON25 explained during a presentation of the departments [LOCATION]6 biennial energy report21 recently that, using census data, agency researchers determined that state tax credits to incentivize solar installations have historically flowed disproportionately to areas with more white residents.The benefits for clean energy were not evenly distributed among [PERSON]ians, said PERSON26.[PERSON]s long-standing tax credits did achieve their primary goal helping transform solar panels into a cost-effective energy source. Providing equity was not an explicit program goal, and it is not surprising that the credits came up short on that measurement. As PERSON26 put it People with low incomes dont have a lot of tax equity, and so credits dont really work for them.That is no longer acceptable in [LOCATION]7, the state says. [PERSON]s ORG27 head said they are now designing programs with equity in mind from the start, as directed by Gov. PERSON27 [LOCATION]8 and guided by ORG28. Solar and home energy storage incentives offered [LOCATION]8, a [LOCATION]9 1.5-million program, provided rebates that help everyone and reserved a quarter of the funds for low- and moderate-income households and installers. PERSON26 called it a modest step toward equitable distribution.Advocates for a just transition to a carbon-free economy that does not unduly burden already-marginalized people say that after [PERSON] of struggle, they are seeing hopeful signs.[PERSON], of [ORGANIZATION] Cleanup CoalitionOne day I woke up and everyone was finally listening to what I had to say.PERSON29 and [ORGANIZATION]0 contributed to this report.

Perhaps more strikingly, most of them wont say why. The action was apparently stimulated by political rifts over [PERSON] and racial equity that have played out nationally. The campaigns of the majority members of the board who engineered the firing were funded largely by money outside the community. In short another local school board has become a hot battleground in the raging culture wars that serve to divide [PERSON]ns and breed a level of intolerance that can lead to something much worse than a debate over how to teach kinds about history. A variety of indicators tell similar stories. Significant numbers of [PERSON]ns actually favor breaking the country up. Sixty-six percent of southern Republicans6, according to a new poll, support leaving the [PERSON] and forming a new country. Those sentiments were shared by 50 of independents and 20 of Democrats. Some eastern and southern [PERSON]ians are advancing the fantasy of a greater [PERSON] that would divide the mostly rural areas of [PERSON] from the allegedly out of touch radicals west of the LOC2. A climate crisis is upon us that threatens vast disruption of world food supplies and a deepening of global inequality.

But but in the midst of the division, chaos, controversy and cynicism of [LOCATION] life it pays - believe me it pays - to live with someone who refuses to play the pessimism card, while still recognizing the perils we face. Im lucky. So, taking a page from Professor [ORGANIZATION]s rules for resisting tyranny - and with encouragement from the breakfast table - I offer my own six-part mini-survival guide for our troubled times. Refuse to be a victim. Many of the defendants facing charges for the assault on the [PERSON] Capitol in [DATE] are invoking the defense that the mob made them do it10. Nonsense. No one is forcing you to be a political victim. Its a choice you make. Knock it off. Democracy doesnt settle disputes by smashing things, but by elections and compromise. You got a grievance, dont nurse it, use the political system to work for change. Anything less is a call for anarchy, the kind that has crippled effective response to real problems in cities like [ORGANIZATION]. Being a victim is easy. Real, responsible political change is damn hard work. Act on your frustrations. But do it responsibly. Give your time, treasure and talent to causes and people you agree with, but at all cost resist the comfortable impulse to support the dividers and the haters. Every town in [PERSON] has a non-profit or ten that exists to feed the hungry, house the homeless, heal the sick or stimulate our souls. Get off the sidelines and get in the real game. Check your priors, or better yet update them. We all come to adulthood with priors, beliefs, notions, ways of seeing things that may or may not be valuable or even correct. Self-awareness is a powerful thing. Most of us are never more certain of what we really dont know much about. Seek truth, not a validation of an opinion. This is a corollary to the previous thought. You really can find factual information if you want to. Sifting through the garbage is tiresome and demanding but remember as you search, historys tyrants always seek to confuse and devalue objective reality. The loathsome PERSON5, a world-class purveyor of misinformation, said the quiet part out loud in [LOCATION]. The Democrats dont matter, [PERSON] said. The real opposition is the media. And the [STREET] to deal with them is to flood the zone with shit. Dont believe all the crap out there. Remember that ethics and character count - always. In our tribal society we tend to believe my side can do no wrong and your side is evil. What is commonly missing from this formulation is the fundamental democratic requirement that demands that leaders always operate within widely accepted ethical boundaries, and that they have the character to not lie to your face, enrich themselves in office or abuse their power. Without ethics and character democracy dies. Think about the future. We are all short timers here. What is our responsibility to the next generation and the next beyond that? Most of us wont be remembered beyond family and friends, but let us live so as to not be remembered for making things worse, but for trying to make things better for a next generation of [PERSON]ns. A great challenge of our times is to prevent political and cultural cynicism from becoming self-fulfilling. If you once believed that everything always turns out well in the end, Timothy [ORGANIZATION] writes, you can be persuaded that nothing turns out well in the end. If you once did nothing because you thought progress is inevitable, then you can continue to do nothing because you think times moves in repeating cycles. History is not destiny. It is a guide.

On [TIME] in [ORGANIZATION], [P[LOCATION]SON], Dr. [P[LOCATION]SON] put on a paper surgical mask and made his [STREET] down a muddy [STREET] toward a row of shelters pitched beneath the fir trees. Smoke drifted up from a small fire tended by two women. One of them stood as he approached. You doing OK? he asked.1 Ad Policy4 Yeah, she said. Got any food?2 Weve got survivor kits, [P[LOCATION]SON] offered, holding out a ziplock bag packed with socks, snacks, antibiotic ointment, and hand sanitizer. Ill take one, the woman said. I want to survive.3 [P[LOCATION]SON], a retired emergency physician, is the medical director of [ORGANIZATION] [STREET] Medicine, a group of doctors, nurses, social workers, and other volunteers who provide care to people living on the streets, in camps, or in forests in the [ORGANIZATION] area. Volunteers go on rounds [P[LOCATION]SON], providing acute care and basic medical supplies and offering to connect people with other services. In [DATE] [ORGANIZATION] volunteers have also been sharing information about [P[LOCATION]SON]-19 as part of a multiorganization effort to protect [ORGANIZATION]s homeless population, estimated at 4,000, during the pandemic.4 In the field, [P[LOCATION]SON] goes by Dr. [P[LOCATION]SON]. Hes known this woman, whom [ORGANIZATION], for [ORGANIZATION]. P[LOCATION]SON3 is [P[LOCATION]SON], and she has chronic hypertension. Shes on medication, and shes feeling better, she told ORG6 for all this crap going on, she added, waving her hands. She was wearing blue latex gloves. Im just stressed out really bad.5 Nearby, a man with a short gray beard poked his head out of a tent. Hed been following news about the coronavirus on his phone. [TIME] [P[LOCATION]SON]s governor issued a stay-home order5, closing some businesses and public spaces that many people without housing rely on. Everythings going to be shut down for [P[LOCATION]SON] now? the man asked. Probably DATE6, yeah, [P[LOCATION]SON] replied.6 How are we supposed to eat? the man said.7 Current Issue More than half a million people across GPE2 experience homelessness on any given night, and the population faces acute risks from the respiratory virus. Many have underlying health conditions6, including chronic lung disease, HIVAIDS, and mental illness, as well as higher levels of stress, which can weaken the immune system. Even in the absence of a viral pandemic, people experiencing unsheltered homelessness have a mortality rate almost 10 times the general populations and nearly three times that of people living in shelters. Access to sanitation facilities, limited under ordinary circumstances, has been further complicated as public spaces like libraries close and service providers suspend operations in response to the pandemic.8 The first confirmed death from [P[LOCATION]SON]-19 in the GPE3 homeless population occurred on [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION] since then, in [P[LOCATION]SON], at least two others have died, and dozens of people living in shelters have tested positive for the coronavirus. Social distancing is difficult if not impossible in shelter settings, though shelters across the country are taking various measures to try to limit the risk, including opening new temporary facilities to relieve crowding elsewhere. For those living outdoors, survival often depends on social bonds. Its a social cohort of people, [P[LOCATION]SON] said, culturally and sometimes economically. Its tough to distance when your income depends on sex work or canning collecting cans for the recycling deposit. He continued, My sense is that the overall risk of getting [P[LOCATION]SON]-19 is lower, simply because of the fresh air. But once it hits, its going to be less well tolerated. And if it hits, the virus doesnt stay in the homeless encampments. Its a threat to everyone.9 [P[LOCATION]SON] down the row of campsites, a woman named P[LOCATION]SON4 asked [P[LOCATION]SON] about the shelter-in-[STREET] rules. I was wondering if theyre possibly going to round us up and put us in camps, and if thats the case, whats going to happen to my dog? she said. That is certainly not the plan, he assured her.10 P[LOCATION]SON4 asked about the symptoms of the disease, and P[LOCATION]SON5, a registered nurse and [ORGANIZATION] volunteer, told her to watch out for cough, fever, and shortness of breath. The hard part is that hospitals are really busy right now because of this, and there are sick people there, so there are risks, he said. But if youre struggling to breathe, then you should go.11 Earlier, [P[LOCATION]SON] asked P[LOCATION]SON3 what her anxiety felt like. He described his own as like a pit in his stomach. Oh, man, she said, it goes right to my heart.12 One of the foundational principles of [STREET] medicine is that providers meet people wherever they are. Offering regular care directly can avert unnecessary, expensive trips to the emergency room. It also helps build trust with people who might never visit a hospital or clinic, even if theyre critically ill or injured. When somebody comes into a health care setting, if theyre not clean or they dont communicate well or they cant bring their service dog, it can result in quite traumatic experiences, so they avoid it, [P[LOCATION]SON] said. Our experience on the streets is that people are underutilizing health care.13 [STREET] Medicine provides acute care and basic medical supplies to people experiencing homelessness in the [ORGANIZATION] area.Over [DATE], [P[LOCATION]SON] has been grappling with a question thats both logistical and ethical How best to provide [STREET] medicine, which depends on personal contact, during a viral pandemic? The difficult thing about doing the work is that contamination measures, distancing, [ORGANIZATION] personal protective equipmentits a little more difficult in some of these chaotic environments, he said. Some of [ORGANIZATION]s outreach has been scaled back simply because many of its volunteers work in hospitals and are busier than ever because of the virus. One of us is probably going to get [P[LOCATION]SON], and I dont know how thats going to affect us, to be honest, he said. That prospect amplifies the need to protect not only [ORGANIZATION]s volunteers but also the people they treat.14 Several dozen [STREET] medicine programs operate in the GPE3. Recently ORG9, which advises local community groups, released [ORGANIZATION] that outreach teams be limited to essential personnel and that they focus on reducing the spread of the pandemic, while still providing the best medical care possible to the rough sleeping population. In [ORGANIZATION], [P[LOCATION]SON] implemented new protocols for distributing medications and supplies to people, and he and [P[LOCATION]SON] wore masks.15 While [P[LOCATION]SON]-19 complicates the logistics of providing care, the pandemic also makes the work more necessary. In addition to reaching an at-risk population, [STREET] medicine can play an important role in public health more broadly. So much of this work, on a practical level, has always been [LOCATION] diversion, [P[LOCATION]SON] said. That mission is much more amplified in its importance now, given the need to focus hospital resources on treating [P[LOCATION]SON]-19.16 Beginning on DATE8, [ORGANIZATION] worked alongside ORG10 and others in an effort to reach as much of the citys unhoused population as possible with information about [P[LOCATION]SON]-19 and supplies, including hand sanitizer. At first, [P[LOCATION]SON] said, many of the people they spoke with seemed uninterested or suspicious, but over the course of [PERSON], they became increasingly concerned. Like P[LOCATION]SON4, many were afraid of being swept up and imprisoned in shelterlike environments.17 Advocates argue8 that [P[LOCATION]SON]-19 should not be used to forcibly move people into shelters. Instead, theyre calling for cities to house people in hotels or other private accommodations during the crisis, and they call for significant increases in funding for housing assistance. It has never been more clear that housing is health care, said P[LOCATION]SON7, the president and CEO of the ORG1al Low Income Housing Coalition, in a statement. Advocates worry not only that the pandemic poses risks to individuals without housing but also that the economic fallout could push others into homelessness. The relief package passed by ORG12 addressed9 some of these concerns, providing 4billion to assist homeless shelters and outreach workers, 1.25 billion for Section8 housing vouchers, 685 million for public housing, and a limited eviction moratorium. Governors in [P[LOCATION]SON], [PERSON], and other states have implemented broader moratoriums on residential evictions.18 In response to the pandemic, [ORGANIZATION], along with other cities, decided to limit its regular sweeps of encampments10, in accordance with new guidance11 from ORG13, which advised that clearing camps could cause people to disperse throughout the community and break connections with service providers. This will be a reprieve for many people living outdoors in [ORGANIZATION], which, like so many other cities, has been embroiled in contentious debates about housing affordability and the encampments. The ask from the people living outside is, If we could just stay put for a little while, wed be better able to clean up, wed do better, we would have less impact on our city, [P[LOCATION]SON] said. After some initial confusion about whether and how [P[LOCATION]SON]s stay-home order affected people without housing, Governor P[LOCATION]SON8 recently clarified12 that her directive is not intended to serve as an enforcement mechanism against [P[LOCATION]SON]s unsheltered population.19 of [ORGANIZATION] [STREET] Medicine prepare to treat people experiencing homelessness in the [ORGANIZATION] area.[TIME], [P[LOCATION]SON] pulled up to a [STREET] in Southeast [ORGANIZATION] where several tents were set up. He and [P[LOCATION]SON] went from tent to tent, calling out, [ORGANIZATION] [STREET] Medicine! You guys doing OK? Anybody need any medical attention? They were greeted by silence. Its eerie, said [P[LOCATION]SON].20 They approached a beige [LOCATION]. A small dog leaped against its windows, barking. The woman who came to the door introduced herself as [P[LOCATION]SON]0. She described a long list of past and present health problems, including cancer, multiple sclerosis, and fibromyalgia. [P[LOCATION]SON] asked if [P[LOCATION]SON]1 been following the news about [P[LOCATION]SON]-19. She said no she didnt have Internet access. [P[LOCATION]SON]2 heard that there was a virus going around but didnt know the symptoms. It sounds like you might be pretty high risk, [P[LOCATION]SON] told her. When he explained that she should watch out for fever, coughing, and shortness of breath, she cut in Youre talking about my life.21 Throughout [TIME], [P[LOCATION]SON] and [P[LOCATION]SON] passed out water, the assembled survival packs, and simple medications, depending on what people said they neededMotrin, antacids, sterile saline for a man whod split his finger open and had been told hed need surgery. With many hospitals postponing nonessential procedures because of the pandemic, it wasnt clear when that could [PERSON], [P[LOCATION]SON] called me. He wanted to underscore the fundamental point of [STREET] medicine. It is, of course, to treat medical ailments, he said. But to explain the work by the minuscule, tiny tasks you see doesnt really capture it. Think about the microbiome, he suggestedthe bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms that keep us alive and sometimes kill us, but mostly keep us alive. Our microbiomes arent ours alone theyre shaped by our environment and who we come in contact with. So are the nonbiological things that make us who we are, he continued. The pandemic illustrates this interdependence in a particularly stark [STREET]. You cant keep a community healthy if you dont keep the least-healthy in mind and cared for, said [P[LOCATION]SON]. We are not all living alone, you know?23  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12 utm_campaignbloxamputm_sourcetwitteramputm_mediumsocial"
portland,2020-06-19T00:00:00Z,Axios,KGW,homelessness,Transit cops could lead police reforms,"DATE0 ORG0 Delivered by ORG1 Urban transit agencies are rethinking how they prevent crime and maintain order following nationwide protests over racial bias and police brutality in the death of [ORGANIZATION] and others.Why it matters Transit police  an often overlooked arm of law enforcement  are the ultimate beat cops. Theyre positioned as potential leaders in the effort to defuse anger and rebuild trust in cities where theres renewed interest in the concept of community policing1.Instead of treating fare evasion or homelessness with arrests and prosecution, some transit agencies are experimenting with more compassionate responses to try to address the root causes of those problems. At the same time, agency officials argue a strong police presence is necessary to prevent serious crime and to boost declining ridership."
portland,2020-06-19T00:00:00Z,Axios,KGW,homeless,Transit cops could lead police reforms,"Context Even before [ORGANIZATION] public transit ridership was falling2, due in part to competition from [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], but also because of safety concerns. Many transit systems have sought to beef up their police presence to soothe passengers worries. ORG2, for example, in [LOCATION] voted to boost the police presence in the subway3 by 20 over DATE2. But critics say a crackdown on fare-jumpers and homeless individuals looking for shelter in stations often targets people of color and low-income people. One example In [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], came under fire for handcuffing and arresting a DATE4 boy4, renewing complaints that they unnecessarily target black passengers for detainment and questioning.Fare enforcement essentially is criminalizing being low income. And you can say exactly the same thing about transit police who are charged with clearing out homeless passengers, said [ORGANIZATION] of the non-profit [ORGANIZATION], which focuses on economic and racial justice.These are just [ORGANIZATION] solutions for much deeper, much more entrenched problems than policing can actually solve. Whats happening Some transit agencies agree and are taking steps to defund their police budgets or adopt new approaches.[ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], ORG6 tri-county regional transit agency, announced5 DATE5 it is cutting six police officer positions and shifting 1.8 million of its 16.2 million police budget to other community-based public safety efforts. It will launch community-wide listening sessions and create an expert advisory panel on how to provide bias-free transit security.[ORGANIZATION] will also begin piloting nonpolice solutions, such as mobile crisis intervention teams for mental and behavioral health issues.The changes came after an independent review board recently found a lack of [ORGANIZATION] by its multi-agency ORG7 and after [ORGANIZATION] Mayor [PERSON] yanked the citys officers7 from the transit agencys police force. In [PERSON], transit police have begun using smartphones to stop fare evaders, a common problem that often leads to more serious offenses, [ORGANIZATION], chief of [ORGANIZATION], tells ORG9. How it works When someone jumps a turnstile, the cashier alerts a [ORGANIZATION]0 officer, who downloads video footage of the offender and blasts it out to the cell phones of other [ORGANIZATION]0 officers waiting at stations downstream for the train to arrive.If the accused gets defensive, the officers show them video proof, which [ORGANIZATION]1 called a tremendous de-escalation tool.Instead of a 300 penalty, fare-jumpers get a 25 fine and another chance. If theyre caught skipping the fare four times, theyre banned from the [ORGANIZATION]0 system and funneled into social service agencies to help with underlying problems like poverty or drug addiction. The bottom line As with any beat officer, transit cops [ORGANIZATION] engagement with the people who pass through their stations can keep more serious problems at bay, says [ORGANIZATION]1.  1  2  3  4  5  6  7"

For example, one key recommendation to reduce smoke exposure is to go indoors into spaces that have lower fine particulate matter than outdoors. However, people have unequal access to this sort of space and some populations are particularly challenged to escape the smoke. Many peoples livelihoods depend on them working outdoors, including farmers, forest workers, those working in construction and landscaping, recreation and tourism, and wildland fire response. In addition, people who are unhoused may have little to no access to clean air during smoke events. Even for those who can go indoors, many houses, commercial establishments, and public buildings especially in lower income communities do not provide indoor air quality that is significantly better than outside, due to lack of filtration systems or poor insulation.

portland,2019-06-30T00:00:00Z,Dissident Voice,KGW,homeless,"You can work long, hard, or smart, but at [ORGANIZATION] you can't choose two out of three","[ORGANIZATION] acknowledges his high standards for employees [ORGANIZATION], telling shareholders that its not easy to work here. In [LOCATION] since GPE6G0 was founded, CEO Jeff [ORGANIZATION] has seen his company grow from a modest online bookshop to one of the most valuable companies in the world. Back in [DATE], [ORGANIZATION] was already expecting big things out of his young company. In his [ORGANIZATION] letter to GPE6G0 shareholders, [ORGANIZATION] described how much effort he expected from his employees. When I interview people I tell them, You can work long, hard, or smart, but at [URL] you cant choose two out of three, [ORGANIZATION] wrote in the [DATE] letter. Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, the single most important element of [URL]s success. GPE6G2 reported in [ORGANIZATION] exactly how bruising the work environment at GPE6G0 could be. Employees were reportedly expected to routinely work late, were encouraged to criticize coworkers ideas at meetings, and were often found crying at their desks. GPE6G0 disputed many of the claims in the GPE6G3 investigation, though the newspaper defended its reporting. PERSON2 forbid we call GPE6G0 Boss [ORGANIZATION] a plantation owner of a different mother, for sure. That Americans  living in small and large cities, far and wide  depend on the GPE6G0 [STREET] as if GPE6G0 is sutured into all aspects of American culture sic and hardwired into every new borns head. DATE5 delivery. A shopping cart that would be the envy of any PERSON3 PERSON4 essay, first, was going to address those other masters of the [PERSON]  GPE6G5 Guys and Algorithm Titans. I barely criticized a billionaire in a [ORGANIZATION] article  [PERSON], or Higher Planes of Consciousness?6 I criticized PERSON5 for his false balance, contrived bifurcation, and his new wind as a billionaire fighting what he calls the educationalism mindset that says that a good, grounded, deep and holistic education might be a thing of kings, whereas [PERSON] says education backing and financing aint worth diddly squat in capitalism until more people make more money to buy more things, or just to survive in his nihilistic world. Taken with this story line, I embraced education as both a philanthropic cause and a civic mission. I co-founded [ORGANIZATION], a nonprofit dedicated to improving public education. I joined [ORGANIZATION], PERSON8, and PERSON9 in giving more than 1 million each to an effort to pass a ballot measure that established [ORGANIZATION] first charter schools. All told, I have devoted countless hours and millions of dollars to the simple idea that if we improved our schoolsif we modernized our curricula and our teaching methods, substantially increased school funding, rooted out bad teachers, and opened enough charter schoolsAmerican children, especially those in low-income and working-class communities, would start learning again. Graduation rates and wages would increase, poverty and inequality would decrease, and public commitment to democracy would be restored.  PERSON5 In my email box, GPE6G5, of course, I get an unsolicited email from an organization for which I have never associated with or even pursued. Its the old surveillance state of GPE6G5 and the internet [LOCATION], for sure Alas, PERSON10 was correct, in so far as what we say and do as writers really does not count  we are only as smart and deep and truthful as our masters will allow In my college economics class, we were taught that wages depend on productivity. The more productive or skilled workers are, my professors used to argue, the more they will be worth on the labor market and, therefore, the higher their wages will be. Thats bunk. Under this logic, the [STREET] to cure our economic woes - whether poverty, inequality, underemployment, or unemployment - is through education. By educating our citizens, we increase their human capital, making them more productive and, therefore, increasing their expected income. It sounds good, right? This seductive myth - of education as an economic cure-all - is something GPE6G6 founder PERSON5 calls educationism. As [PERSON] writes in a recent article for GPE6G7, its a myth he used to believe, and its a myth many wealthy elites still propagate. Its what leads philanthropists to donate billions of dollars to public schools and educational institutions. Theres just one problem Educationism doesnt work. If it did, our middle class would be much better off. In [ORGANIZATION], while the real incomes of most Americans have been stuck, weve gotten a lot more educated. Almost everyone has a high school diploma and the share of Americans with a college degree has more than tripled since [PERSON]. But all that education hasnt translated into higher wages. In fact, if our incomes had done what my college profs told me - gone up with productivity - the average family DATE8 would be earning 29,000 more [LOCATION]4. An average of 105,000! Of course, its true that getting an education is likely to increase your own income. But thats not the same as raising incomes throughout the economy. Not when four out of five of the fastest growing jobs pay very low wages - jobs like cashiers and health care assistants. Meanwhile, the pay of most people who do have a college education barely keeps up with inflation. What we do need to do is raise incomes for working families and the middle class throughout the economy. Thats how we build an economy that works for all of us, not just the wealthy few. As [PERSON] writes In short, great public schools are the product of a thriving middle class, not the other [STREET] around. Pay people enough to afford dignified middle-class lives, and high-quality public schools will follow. But allow economic inequality to grow, and educational inequality will inevitably grow with it.  PERSON11, GPE6G6, email with an ask for  support But then, this essay takes a twist, as they always seem to do when I deploy some ground-truthing. You see, most of us in the [PERSON], the 80 percent of the population  many of which are on the skids, on the near skids, or those of us barely scraping by, and those of us who are unseen but are many short steps away from working for one of those sweatshops like we see with GPE6G0 there are so many warehouse jobs, forklift gigs, sorting careers and finding down time in the back seat of our cars  so-so tire of, really, the prognosticators writing away hard in semi-secure status  even the smartish ones on leftish magazines like GPE6G8, or digital forums like GPE6G9 or GPE6G10 or GPE6G11. They have NO idea of what is real in the world, and that rarefied realm of citing this study or making this or that prediction, well, it is bombast at best, propaganda at worst, denuded of humanity in many cases. Case in point  tens of millions of men and women wandering the land GPE2, in some warped version of Steinbecks Grapes of Wrath, really, in a society that eats-sleeps-dreams-believes the crap that PERSON12 warned of, and that which PERSON10 discussed. Oh the irony, those, that billionaire book salesman, [ORGANIZATION], dead to the world, dead to us, the 80 percent, living, barely, in the middle of their hellish barbecue. I was with three fellows  two literally are sleeping in campgrounds, and one fellow living with his parents. A million miles away from what any social worker or PERSON13 or PERSON14 or PERSON15 or any of the scions of PERSON16 or anyone in the PERSON24 PERSON17 Show, or those clamoring around an PERSON18 or PERSON19 or PERSON20. Its a triple sick experience even thinking about how vapid that so-called debate was [PERSON] with half of the half-wits of GPE6G12 wanting to play president. So, a life of men truly on the extinction block, in several demographics. These fellows I hired on to help my spouse and I move from a rental to a house we had the temerity to purchase in a Time of Climate Heating, Oceans Rising, [PERSON], Water Draining, [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], and ICBM Immolating. Their lives, broken down, seem to hold the familiar life story of many people I have worked with as a non-traditional social worker for the homeless, the just-out-of-prison returnees, and chronically physically and mentally ill. They work jobs, stacking halibut, packing shrimp, pounding two-by-fours, hauling goods, sorting things, cutting trees, landscaping, roofing. Both of these fellows are [LOCATION]0, living in campgrounds, one with false teeth, the other with nubs and rotting teeth. Child support for children they have never seen, or cant see now. Felonies for this or that charge keeping them from even getting to first base on an apartment application. Vagabonds harassed by cops, and living life in a constant move. For my other helper, PERSON21, hes a former marine, working as a social services provider, has a wonderful child on the spectrum autism and is currently living with aging and sickly parents. All three fit the bill for zero tolerance in this society. Never reflected in the news stories, in [LOCATION], never on the minds of [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]. I know for a fact, though, that those Little Eichmanns who populate the other 19 percent of the 20 Percenters, well, many of them have one degree of separation when it comes to family members with substance abuse issues, chronic mental or physical illness, depression, suicidal, schizophrenic, and homeless. You get both barrels of human pain and human survival and some human triumphs when talking with real people, albeit, denigrated folk, disenfranchised humans. They are really rough around the edges, but these fellows, PERSON22 and PERSON23, they are examples of struggle and defeat and some triumph, as PERSON21 and I note and agree. They are so far from any of the discourse going on around the world  the complete irrelevance of all the trolling, all the internet crap, all the stuff that makes for an echo chamber that sucks humanity and human connection from the ether. You look at PERSON22, and you see a man on the skids. Big laughing screwed up face, almost Dickensian, crazy might be one moniker. Hustling and wanting to have people know that there was once a time when he had some normalcy, some sense of being a man in society  not on the skids. Though, PERSON22 would not see himself on the skids. Brain injury [LOCATION]1 when a van hit him head on as a pedestrian. And he still works, moves heavy furniture, and hammers roofs. PERSON23, a former truck driver, someone who has [LOCATION]2 in the GPE6G14, and as PERSON21 states  people are only awakened to the level of how they have been able to access those tools necessary to be woken up. Yet, PERSON21 states that hed much rather be in the company of these men than the MSWs and other graduate-level punishers hes worked with, as I have also worked with, in the non-profit arenas as supposed social services workers. They probably know nothing about this movement, which could affect PERSON22 and PERSON23 When reporters for theInternational GPE6G0 Workers7 Voiceinterviewed part-time GPE6G0 associates a cheap euphemism for employees used to disguise the exploitative relationship between workers and management at the company in GPE3 to discuss their attitude toward [ORGANIZATION] fortune, they were met with a torrent of disgust, calls for sharing the wealth, and social anger. Tell Mr. [ORGANIZATION] and the rest of management to come out of their offices and get on the shop floor said one worker who identified herself as a single mother of two. At [DATE], they never feel what we go through in [LOCATION]3 for [TIME]. They get to sit down in their offices and get paid more than we will see in [LOCATION]4, she said. [ORGANIZATION] wealth typifies the [STREET] an increasingly small number of multi-billionaire CEOs and finance operatives extract ever more obscene sums from the international workforce. This process of ever-increasing wealth for the few and exploitation for the majority is reaching a political breaking point. Explaining her work environment during [LOCATION]5, the working mother said, they just had us move 100,000 packages in [TIME], and at the end we arent even paid enough to take care of our kids. Im a single mother, I dont receive food stamps. My rent is 8[LOCATION]0 a month. I have to pay for gas, electricity, bus passes, plus raise two kids. If we decided to quit, who would move these packages out of the door? she said, noting the social power of the workers employed by the company. We are the ones making you rich. PERSON21 and I talk about GPE6G0, and the nefarious nature of how the guy at GPE6G16 attacks the fourth grader PERSON24 and others, while he is part of [ORGANIZATION]. From GPE6G118 [LOCATION] extensive relationship with the GPE6G18, GPE6G19, GPE6G20 and other surveillance agencies in the west is multi-faceted, highly lucrative and rapidly growing. [LOCATION]6, the GPE6G21 on a new app9that GPE6G0 developers and British police forces have jointly developed to use on the public in police work, just the latest example of third partiesaiding10,automating11, and in some cases,replacing12, the functions of law enforcement agencies  and raises privacyquestions13about [LOCATION] role as an intermediary. Then theres the patent GPE6G0 obtained [LOCATION]7,as reported by the GPE6G23, that would allow its virtual assistant [ORGANIZATION] to decipher a users physical characteristics and emotional state based on their voice. In particular, it would enable anyone using the product to determine a persons accent and likely [STREET] of origin The algorithm would alsoconsider a customers physical location  based on their [ORGANIZATION] address, primary shipping address, and browser settings  to help determine their accent. All of this is taking [STREET] as GPE6G0 vies for, and is the favorite to win, one of the largest GPE6G20 contracts yet a 10 billion agreement to provide exclusive cloud services to the worlds largest military. GPE6G24 reported [LOCATION]8 that the company is now enmeshed in scandal over that effort,specifically aformal investigation15into whether GPE6G0 improperly hired a former GPE6G25 worker who was involved with a 10 billion government contract for which the tech company iscompeting. [ORGANIZATION] relationship with the military and spying agencies of GPE6G26, and law enforcement agencies around the world, predates his purchase of GPE6G16 and has become a central prong of [LOCATION] business growth. Back in [LOCATION]9, GPE6G0 secureda massive contract with the CIA16when the spy agency agreed to pay it 600 million for computing cloud software. As the GPE6G27 noted at the time, [LOCATION] software will begin servicing all 17 agencies that make up the intelligence community. Given how vital the military and spy agencies now are to [LOCATION] business, its unsurprising that the [LOCATION] pays to lobbyists17to serve its interests in [PERSON] has exploded quadrupling since 2013from 3 million to almost 15 million [DATE]0, according to GPE6G28. What would the house-less PERSON22 and PERSON23 say about this Byzantine world of hyper billions of dollars and hyper trillions of human hours wasted on the things of capitalism, of power and control, consumption?I know many friends who wonder why we  people like me  still live in the GPE2? Many wonder what it will take young people to stand down the systems of oppression. Some believe the young people have it, as in PERSON25, or [ORGANIZATION], the new face sic of American politics. This system we have now is one where a few voices count get read, heard, published, followed, and the majority of voices are just bursts of yelling in the woods, in campgrounds, in ones lovely home in the old sedan, in our own bedlam. People travelling from one insane [STREET] to another, but in that realm, a sanity sets in for guys like PERSON22 and PERSON23. The world is pretty clear-cut, and on many levels, these people have positive outlooks  toothless, no real estate or swelling investment accounts. Just that hard [STREET] forward. [ORGANIZATION] and bicycling miles [LOCATION]3. Places to shower. Places to get out of the rain without the bulldozers of misanthropy pushing them further and further into ditches or out on the periphery until they stare us all down, face to face, the coming of a New Brave World. Is it the entertaining ourselves to death cycle, or a little bit of the other  big brother, watching our every move, holding every syllable mouthed in a cloud server, every speck of mole cataloged, and every word penned or typed, collected to hold us at bay, hold us as prisoners of our own faulty beliefs? Needless to say, PERSON26 grew to hate the system and rail against it in his works. In his seminal novella A [DATE]2 Carol, PERSON27 is visited by two portly men raising money for the poor. At [DATE]1, Mr. [PERSON], said the one of the gentlemen, taking up a pen, it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the Poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at the present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir. Are there no prisons? asked [PERSON]. Plenty of prisons, said the gentleman, laying down the pen again. And the GPE6G29 workhouses? demanded [PERSON]. Are they still in operation? They are. Still, returned the gentleman, I wish I could say they were not. The FAC0 and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then? said [PERSON]. Both very busy, sir. Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had occurred to stop them in their useful course, said [PERSON]. Im very glad to hear it. Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude, returned the gentleman, a few of us are endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and means of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time, of all others, when [PERSON] is keenly felt, and [PERSON] rejoices. What shall I put you down for? Nothing! [PERSON] replied. You wish to be anonymous? I wish to be left alone, said [PERSON]. Since you ask me what I wish, gentlemen, that is my answer. I dont make merry myself at [DATE]2 and I cant afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the establishments I have mentioned they cost enough and those who are badly off must go there. Many cant go there and many would rather die. If they would rather die, said [PERSON], they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.  PERSON29, [DATE]3, A [DATE]2Carol Or, updated for [DATE]4, as illustrated by a commentator on an article about [PERSON], GPE6, once GPE7, now GPE8 To disrupt illegal camp sites set up by homeless in [PERSON], ORG30 ORG31 is moving boulders onto the roadsides. The project will eventually cost about a million dollars, but ORG31 argues this cost is less than the cost of dealing with existing campsites.

His wife was treated for her injuries at ORG29.. 102 Police Damage Done by Some During Otherwise Peaceful Demonstration103 GPE23, [PERSON] caused during abortion rights rally in downtown GPE25 marred an otherwise peaceful event [ORGANIZATION] [TIME]. The damage was not as widespread as some instances in the past, but any damage is tough for a downtown trying to make a comeback. This time there was graffiti and broken glass, and some burning items thrown at FAC1 federal courthouse in downtown GPE25. 104 [PERSON] Bests Joe [PERSON] by 11 Points in Prospective Poll of DATE20 PERSON49 led [PERSON] by 14, meanwhile. Gov. [PERSON] keeps saying he has no plans to run for President in DATE21, but one poll says hed win the popular vote in a landslide against the current incumbent. A survey released [ORGANIZATION] by ORG30 shows the [PERSON]3 Governor commanding 46 support against 35 for Democrat Joe [PERSON]. An additional 11 said theyd vote for someone else, and 2 said they wouldnt vote. 106 [PERSON]0 [ORGANIZATION] in Efforts to Save Far-Left GPE26 DA [PERSON]1 From Recall Election107 A group co-founded by ORG31 activist [PERSON]0 is heavily involved in saving far-left [LOCATION] Attorney Chesa [PERSON]1 from his DATE22 recall election. ORG32, co-founded by [PERSON]3, is working overtime to ensure [PERSON]1 remains in office as critics seek to oust him over what they say is his lack of criminal enforcement and failure to make GPE26 safe. [PERSON]3 and individuals associated with [ORGANIZATION] have a vested interest in the controversial DA through a separate and little-known group called ORG34, which was co-created by [PERSON]3 and houses a criminal justice campaign involving [PERSON]1. 108 GPE27 DA Purchased Controversial Social Media Facial Recognition Software109 Controversy-riddled [ORGANIZATION] facial recognition system has been used, and paid for, by GPE27s district attorney in some also fairly controversial ways, the ORG35 claims, basing its report on city records. The information, obtained via ORG36 and Freedom of Information requests show that despite its notoriety, the use of [ORGANIZATION] by prosecutors in this GPE29 borough has been largely unsupervised. It is also said that [ORGANIZATION] stopped using the technology [PERSON]. 110 PERSON49 Reacts to [PERSON]s ORG38 Criticism, Says Movement Saving [PERSON]111 EXCLGPE2IVE Former President PERSON49 on [ORGANIZATION] told ORG16 [ORGANIZATION] that ORG38 is saving [PERSON], and slammed President [PERSON] for being divisive when he called ORG38 the most extreme political organization thats existed in recent [PERSON]n history. ORG38 is saving [PERSON], PERSON49 told ORG16. Our country is going to hell. ORG38 is saving [PERSON]. 112 PERSON49s Endorsement Power Was Evident in [PERSON] and [PERSON]1  Though There Are Limits113 Republican candidates backed by former President [PERSON] PERSON49 had [TIME] in [PERSON] and [PERSON]1 primaries [ORGANIZATION] night. Many of these candidates are younger and likely to make it to ORG39  and if more of them win elsewhere DATE23, this cycle could represent something of a bridge to PERSON49ism, even post-PERSON49. They are examples of the potentially lasting effects of how PERSON49 has changed ORG6 politics  although there are limits to his influence. Pro-PERSON49 candidates continued to do best in rural areas, underscoring where his power is concentrated, but there remains a question of how well PERSON49ism can do in swing areas. In the more short term  and something worth tracking  there was an indication that Republican enthusiasm is up, while Democrats is down. Thats evident in how much ORG6 turnout rose, compared with the DATE24 primaries. 114 Victims of Communism Day Legislation on Gov. [PERSON]6 Desk for [LOCATION] The legislation sets aside DATE25 and requires students learn the human cost of communism. Legislation that requires students to learn about the suffering inflicted by communism was one of 17 bills that landed on Gov. [PERSON] desk [ORGANIZATION]. With the [PERSON] signature, he and succeeding [PERSON] would declare DATE26 Victims of Communism Day. That is the anniversary of DATE27 when [PERSON]7 stormed the GPE47n capital to overthrow the government. It ignited a worldwide movement. The bill called for honoring the 100 million victims of communist regimes around the world. 116 Video [PERSON]8 Grills [LOCATION]0 Head on [ORGANIZATION] of Truth117 Senator [PERSON]8 grilled Department of [ORGANIZATION] Secretary [PERSON] on the recently announced disinformation governance board [PERSON], noting that there isnt even an agreement of what disinformation is and that the government has a long history of propagating it. [PERSON]9 questioned PERSON34 on the new board, which has been dubbed [LOCATION]1 by critics, referencing PERSON60. The Senator asked the [LOCATION]0 head Do you think the PERSON61 dossier included GPE47n disinformation? prompting PERSON34 to answer that he is not equipped to answer that. 118 Canadians Should be Informed if [ORGANIZATION] is Being Collected by [LOCATION]2 The [LOCATION]3 ethics committee wants the federal government to inform Canadians if theyre being spied on and to give them the option to opt out of data-collection surveillance programs.

[PERSON] it was revealed that [ORGANIZATION] obtained data from 33 million devices to conduct population mobility patterns research during lockdowns. 120 Did a [PERSON]2 Elementary School Seriously Just Cancel DATE29 A child may be confused as to whether there is something wrong with traditional celebrations of honouring mothers this time of year, as schools move to replace [ORGANIZATION]0 with, or celebrate it along with [PERSON] Us Day. As reported in [LOCATION]6, parents reported that [LOCATION]7 had cancelled the schools traditional celebrations of [ORGANIZATION]0, and replaced it with the new inclusive celebration. When [LOCATION]6 reached out to get more clarification on the decision from PERSON62, including inquiring as to whether children will be permitted to make [ORGANIZATION]0 cards in school DATE23, the PERSON63 refused to comment, stating like I said, no comment. It has nothing to do with you. 122 [ORGANIZATION] Pastor [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION] PERSON64 and [LOCATION]8 were convicted [PERSON] of three counts each of breaching Section 71 of [ORGANIZATION] by obstructing an inspector. PERSON65 admitted during trial that she prevented a health inspector from disrupting [LOCATION]8 worship services to inspect for compliance with [PERSON]4 government [ORGANIZATION]-19 restrictions on places of worship. 124 Federal Government Cracking Down on Freedom of the Press125 PERSON66 and the federal government often boast about the level of press freedom in [PERSON]5. Taking no responsibility for their own censorship efforts, [ORGANIZATION] and their media allies have actually aimed the blame at peaceful protesters for making journalists feel uncomfortable. On [ORGANIZATION]1 episode of The Ezra Levant Show, we examined the current state of press freedom in [PERSON]5, and looked back at eight examples of the federal governments heavy-handed measures to clamp down on our journalism. 126 Petition Help Us Fight the [ORGANIZATION] Surveillance State127 We can see that health restrictions are slowly being dropped and that theres a certain return to normalcy. Unfortunately, a bigger problem is headed our [STREET]  one that will allow the government to know everything about us. Im of course talking about digital identities. Oddly enough, at the federal level, the application created to gather your information uses QR codes. Was the vaccine passport just a test to this more complex version? Were launching a petition to send a message to the government that citizens refuse to be tracked and that they want to keep their freedoms and rights as Canadians. [PERSON] might be one of the first provinces to move forward with this technology, but lets not wait for it to become a national thing. If digital identities come into play, life as weve known it will never be the same again! We must take action! Sign the petition at Stop[ORGANIZATION][URL] in large numbers, and we will deliver it to the government to send a message that Canadians are opposed to a digital surveillance state. 128 [DATE] [PERSON] Lets Feds Censor Everyday Content129 [DATE] officials have warned that if Prime Minister PERSON66s internet regulation bill goes through, it could give the government unprecedented power over everyday content posted online. According to [DATE] [PERSON]5s head of government affairs PERSON68, [PERSON] wording is so broad that it places home videos within the purview of [ORGANIZATION]1 [ORGANIZATION]. Despite claims by the PERSON69 government that the law would exclude ordinary videos, several experts have blasted the update to the Broadcasting Act as an affront to freedom of expression. 130 [ORGANIZATION] in Power Line Attack131 French prosecutors in [PERSON]7 have identified far-left extremists as the most likely suspects in the sabotage of an electrical line on a bridge that was damaged by arson [ORGANIZATION]2. The arson attack on [ORGANIZATION], which crosses [ORGANIZATION] near the city of [PERSON]7, took [STREET] [ORGANIZATION]2 in [LOCATION]9 and led to over 5,500 people in the nearby commune of [PERSON]9 going without power as the bridge contained electrical power lines that were damaged as a result of the fire. 132 [LOCATION] [PERSON]0 Camp Out in GPE40 A group of several dozen [ORGANIZATION] camps are situated in front of the railway station in the Czech town of GPE41 and officials do not know what to do with them. The [ORGANIZATION] allegedly refuse the governments offered accommodation, and while a [STREET] for them may be found eventually, this group of people often presents a serious problem. They probably speak Hungarian and [ORGANIZATION]ni, perhaps some [LOCATION], and often have dual Hungarian and [LOCATION] citizenship. These are people for whom nationality is a strange concept, something that is forced on them or provided by a state. The state, like citizenship, is something beyond their imagination and certainly nothing they desire. They live in their own state, [LOCATION], which has no borders and is where they decide to go whenever possible. They are, therefore, poetically called the children of the wind. 134 GPE43 Serious Adverse Jab Reactions 40 ORG78 Higher Than Previously Reported135 A German study has found that the number of serious side effects after [ORGANIZATION] vaccines was 40 times higher than previously reported. The [ORGANIZATION]2, a well-known hospital in GPE[DATE], interviewed 40 000 vaccinated people after they had received their mandated jabs. 136 GPE43 As GPE[DATE] Housing Crisis Grows, [ORGANIZATION] a Dramatic Solution137 The association of GPE[DATE]-Brandenburg housing companies [ORGANIZATION] has proposed a legal limitation on living space for individuals at a time when the city, just like the rest of [LOCATION], is struggling with a continuing housing crisis. It is not possible for us to complain about shortages while, at the same time, the living space per capita in many places continues to increase, said association leader [PERSON]1 on [PERSON]. What would these proposed restrictions look like? In essence, they would force people who live in bigger spaces to move to smaller spaces or pay an extra tax, at least for those people renting from the various housing companies and [ORGANIZATION] in the city. 138 GPE46 Will Veto ORG66s Energy Sanctions Against GPE47139 GPE46 will veto the [LOCATION]an Unions planned sixth round of sanctions against GPE47, which includes a halt to oil imports by [ORGANIZATION]3, government spokesman [PERSON]2 said on [PERSON]. Asked by the [ORGANIZATION]5 whether GPE46 will exercise its veto, [PERSON]3 said, In short, yes, but you also need to know how the [LOCATION]an Union works. The proposal comes from GPE48 that is, from the administrative, bureaucratic center of the [LOCATION]an Union  not from the member states. They know exactly that what they are proposing is contrary to Hungarian interests, and if we support it, we will completely destroy the Hungarian economy.  140 New Information  GPE49 Can Become a [ORGANIZATION]7 Member in [ORGANIZATION]4 According to new information published by a Norwegian source, GPE49s and [ORGANIZATION]9 application to [ORGANIZATION]7, which is becoming increasingly likely, can take [STREET] in a record time of [ORGANIZATION]5.

The school was re-established in DATE24 with financial support from GPE46, and at the time, it received approval from the [ORGANIZATION]nian Parliament, followed by a [ORGANIZATION]nian ORG63 decree granting it a license. However, [ORGANIZATION]7, two [ORGANIZATION]nian nationalist parties contested the license in [STREET], saying that the existence of a school exclusively teaching in a minority language  in this case, Hungarian  was unconstitutional. 1[DATE] [PERSON]6 Finnish Membership Will Make [ORGANIZATION]7 Stronger145 Secretary General of ORG64, [PERSON]5, said that if [PERSON]2 decides to join the military alliance the accession process would be very smooth and quick. He made the comments in an exclusive interview with ORG65 journalist [PERSON]7 on [ORGANIZATION]. 146 The Real Issues ORG66 Using Mindfulness To Combat Green Anxieties of Climate Crazy Staff147 Officials within the [LOCATION]an Union are now being drafted into environment-focused mindfulness courses to help alleviate their climate crazy anxieties. Move over shrinks of GPE48! Climate crazy [ORGANIZATION] have a new [STREET] of handling their existential dread brought about by their understanding of climate change mindfulness. Derived largely from religious practices found within ORG67, so-called mindfulness meditation is now believed by a number of major organisations to be mentally helpful for some people, with the [PERSON]s socialised healthcare service even dedicating an entire webpage to explaining the possible values the practice can have for those living in the modern world.

He stated that [PERSON]9 currently has over 2.5 million refugees, with 90 percent being women and children, along with elderly people. Together with the [LOCATION]s who worked in [PERSON]9 previously, the total amount of [LOCATION]s is 3.5 million.

GPE47 resumed bombing the [PERSON] steel plant in [LOCATION]7, DATE[DATE] after the evacuation of hundreds of civilians, [LOCATION] officials said. Civilians who managed to escape the plant after [PERSON]5 under GPE47n siege described their long ordeal and their relief at surviving [TIME]. The GPE47n [ORGANIZATION] said it had used air-launched missiles to strike the [LOCATION]8 military airfield in the [LOCATION]9 region, as well as a large ammunition depot and a fuel-storage facility for [LOCATION] military equipment in the [LOCATION]0 region on LOC2. [LOCATION] officials in those regions confirmed strikes [TIME] but didnt give an assessment of the targets and levels of damage. GPE47 GPE47 blamed [LOCATION]5 for shelling inside GPE47 during artillery exchanges between the two sides over the border. A series of attacks inside GPE47n territory and unexplained explosions at GPE47n targets near the border have expanded the scope of the conflict. [LOCATION]2 said President PERSON84 apologized to Prime Minister [PERSON] for comments by the GPE47n foreign minister about Jews, neo-Nazis and [LOCATION]5. The ORG74 didnt mention any apology in its account of a conversation between the two leaders. [LOCATION] An international donor conference in [LOCATION]1 drew pledges for [LOCATION]5 relief totaling more than 6 billion euros, equivalent to more than 6.3 billion. 160 [PERSON]9 Second Only to GPE2 on Aid for [LOCATION]5161 [PERSON]9 ranks second only to [LOCATION]2 with regards to the amount of aid the country has supplied to [LOCATION]5, according to research data produced by ORG75.

[LOCATION]3 is focusing on providing location and other information about the GPE47n [ORGANIZATION], which is often relocating, the ORG79 wrote. [LOCATION] officers have combined this geographical information with their knowledge and carried out artillery strikes and other attacks that have killed GPE47n officers, the newspaper added, although it did not specify how many GPE47n generals were killed based on information provided by the [ORGANIZATION]. 164 [DATE] Boasts Removal of 8,000 [ORGANIZATION]s, 60,000 [LOCATION]5 War Videos1[LOCATION]7 [DATE] has announced that it has removed more than 8,000 channels and 60,000 videos for misinformation, hate speech or graphic violence related to the war in [LOCATION]5.

One of the things that I think happened in [LOCATION], after having schools closed for so long, people were really focused on schools and education, PERSON21 said in an interview on DATE17 TODAY with PERSONDATE60.

portland,2021-03-01T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,KGW,"homeless, homelessness, affordable housing","Here's What Happens When [ORGANIZATION], Not Police, [ORGANIZATION]","Ultimately, she was directed to someone at [ORGANIZATION] who said she would pay the site a visit. But every time the ORG1 worker came by, the homeless people had already moved on, only to come back later. Shes never been able to make contact with them because by the time she comes out, theyre gone, [ORGANIZATION] said. It would definitely help if there were someone who could respond quicker. Theyd reach them and be able to have a dialogue. Police are often called on to address complaints about homelessness and mental illness.[PERSON] lacks a crisis response team that can be dispatched immediately to address mental health crises and behavioral health issues. Instead, the task often falls to a patchwork of social services providers whose work is supported by temporary grants. Or to [ORGANIZATION] police officers, most of whom are not trained in crisis intervention or de-escalation for the mentally ill. Behavioral health calls make up 10 to 30 of ORG9s call volume, the department said. A growing number of American cities are embracing another [STREET] sending mental health first responders instead of police. The teams are made up of unarmed crisis workers, such as social workers and health care personnel, who advocates say are better equipped than police to handle cases that dont involve violence or crime. The concept was pioneered in [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]. ORG2 - or ORG3 - is embedded in the areas 911 system. Dispatchers who receive calls about mental health crises, homelessness, substance abuse and other welfare checks direct the information to ORG2. On a fundamental level, the ORG2 program is designed to send the right kind of first responders into emergent crisis situations where theres not a crime being committed, theres no medical emergency, no fire to be put out, but where there is still somebody whos in profound need, said [ORGANIZATION], the consulting director of [ORGANIZATION], which runs ORG21. ORG2 team members help deescalate conflict, refer individuals to services and even transport them to shelters, stabilization sites or medical clinics - avoiding unnecessary stays in jail or the emergency room, [ORGANIZATION] said. Outreach workers in [ORGANIZATION] are not embedded into the 911 system. In [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], theyre treated like other first responders.Courtesy oF PERSON4 The program handles about 17 of the [ORGANIZATION] Police Departments call volume [LOCATION], which saves the [INSTITUTION] an estimated 8.5 million DATE2, according to [ORGANIZATION]. ORG2 budget is only 2.1 million. The team can always call for backup if workers need police assistance - theyre on the police radio system - but those occasions are rare. Of the 24,000 calls ORG2 responded to in [LOCATION], only 360, or 1.5, required police backup, [ORGANIZATION] said. Half of those cases only required police to conduct an involuntary psychiatric hold. Interaction with ORG2 is voluntary, [ORGANIZATION] said. We enter into our interactions with community members on a foundation of mutual trust and with an objective of the least intervention necessary to find immediate de-escalation and stabilization, [ORGANIZATION] said. Thats different from an officer who was trained through the academy, and this mentality is ingrained in them as a patrol officer, that they are a warrior and that they need to assume that every interaction they have with a community member could potentially become fatal, and to assumethat it will become violent and potentially fatal. Cities across the country are increasingly adopting the ORG2 model2. It has gained particular momentum in [DATE] as protests nationwide have called for police reform, including shifting police responsibilities and resources toward social services agencies. [PERSON] recently started sending personnel from its health and fire departments to behavioral health crises in lieu of police. GPE4 announced [PERSON] that it plans to pilot the concept in [ORGANIZATION] and East [ORGANIZATION], areas that produce the most mental-health related emergency calls. ORG6 started a similar program [ORGANIZATION]. Around the same time, [PERSON], GPE6 a new city department to pursue the idea. GPE7, Florida7launched its mental health team [PERSON], as did [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION]8. Theres even federal legislation9 aimed at helping states adopt the ORG2 model, introduced by senators from [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]0, and legislators are working to include a pared down version of that bill in the upcoming COVID-19 relief package10. Several mental health advocates in [ORGANIZATION] told ORG7 its a concept the city should consider. People who are having mental health problems are generally not criminals, said PERSON5, a longtime advocate for mental health and people experiencing homelessness. While they may be breaking some kind of misdemeanors, being a nuisance or behaving oddly, theyre generally not committing crimes. But their behavior can be very disconcerting and unpleasant. But thats not the kind of thing police are really trained to handle. Thats not what their job description is.They Have The Skills [ORGANIZATION] Police Chief [PERSON] is open to the idea of handing some police responsibilities to social workers. Following [ORGANIZATION] Lives Matter protests DATE8, the chief said at a press conference she agreed with activists that society relies too much on the police to address social ills. ORG9 should not be the primary respondents to matters involving homelessness and mental illness, she said. [ORGANIZATION] [INSTITUTION] Chief [PERSON] has lamented the fact that handling homelessness and mental illness has become a police responsibility.[PERSON] Those are all social issues that should be handled elsewhere, she said. Unfortunately when nobody else steps up, and there is nowhere else to turn to, people always turn to the police to take care of whatever the problem is. [ORGANIZATION] said she would much prefer social workers to take homelessness and mental illness off her departments plate. I think it would be fantastic because they have the skills, she said. [ORGANIZATION] declined to be interviewed for this story. In a statement, she said ORG9 has advocated for the involvement of social services providers and the department is open to finding alternate ways of responding to scenes. While we have looked at the programs being used in other cities and reached out to different agencies, we are not starting our own program at this time due to the pandemic and fiscal constraints, she said. However, replacing police with unarmed crisis responders has the potential to save money, according to ORG2. Beyond reducing the police departments call volume, [ORGANIZATION] estimates it saved over 14 million for ambulance rides and emergency room visits in DATE9. [ORGANIZATION] started training officers in crisis intervention11 in [LOCATION]0, but only 58 officers have completed the training so far, according to the departments latest strategic planning update. The pandemic interrupted an effort to train more officers, the department said. The department also runs the [ORGANIZATION] program, which pairs officers with homeless outreach workers to help connect unsheltered people to services.Could [ORGANIZATION] Adopt This Model?Police responses to mental and behavioral health callscan sometimes devolve into violence or even death. Mental health cases make up 13 of use-of-force incidents, according to the [ORGANIZATION] Police Departments latest force report12. And in [LOCATION]0, incidents in which island police injured or killed a person in mental distress have made headlines. [ORGANIZATION] lacks stabilization beds and affordable housing.[PERSON] That includes a [ORGANIZATION]1 man with schizophrenia who was killed by police in [LOCATION]1, a man on methamphetamine who died in [LOCATION]2 14after officers pepper-sprayed him and shot him with a [ORGANIZATION] and a man who suffered from paranoia killed by police in [LOCATION]3 after he allegedly threatened officers with a knife. Even in a ORG2 model, police would still need to respond to situations involving a weapon or aggressive behavior, but [ORGANIZATION] said crisis workers do sometimes respond in tandem with police to help with deescalation. In [ORGANIZATION]2, [ORGANIZATION]3, which started a modified version of ORG2 DATE8, the crisis workers respond alongside police officers. That collaboration is important for the safety of the mental health responders, according to [LOCATION], the countys emergency medical services director. My concern is everyone is jumping on the bandwagon of trying to take PD out of this equation, and there will be people who will get hurt who work for me, he said. Some mental health advocates in [ORGANIZATION] also expressed support for the ORG2 concept but were concerned about crisis responder safety. Its definitely a good option to explore, said [ORGANIZATION], a former ORG9 psychologist who is now in private practice. The hard thing is it can go from zero to 60 really quick and a crisis worker isnt comfortable with that. Another challenge in [ORGANIZATION] is the lack of stabilization facilities and affordable housing for people in crisis, according to several advocates. So even if crisis workers were able to calm people down and get them to accept help, there are few places to bring them for long-term care. We dont have anywhere to take them, said PERSON10, executive director of ORG13. There really are no stabilization beds. There really is no [STREET] for them to go If we dont have a stabilization center, we cant really do this project. ORG2 strength is in being a facilitator for people in crisis, [ORGANIZATION] said. But without a [STREET] to bring people that will address their needs, the program would fail. The only reason that ORG2 is as successful as we are keeping folks away from jail or out of the hospital is because we have a network of other resources in our community to rely on, [ORGANIZATION] said. If we didnt have those other resources available, we would just be helping cycle people through the hospital, and folks would still be going to jail. If a community like [ORGANIZATION] is really considering mobile crisis response inspired by ORG2, there also really needs to be an evaluation of what resources are lacking in the community for folks in crisis.

Mental illness is [LOCATION] more common among thehomeless in [PERSON] than in any other state. According to a study from [ORGANIZATION], 35-401of homeless adults in [PERSON] suffer from some form of mental illness. The problem is apparent along FAC0, a popular biking trail on the east side of [ORGANIZATION] thatis cherished as peaceful slice of nature hidden from the urban sprawl."
portland,2019-10-18T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,KGW,"homeless, homelessness",Why [ORGANIZATION]'s [PERSON] Is the Worst in the Nation,"In [ORGANIZATION], a shantytown alongside a two-mile stretch of the corridor was the largest homeless encampment in the [ORGANIZATION]. It contained nearly 200 tents and an estimated 500 homeless people. In [LOCATION] since, criminal activity has become a routine occurrence. For example, in [DATE], police arrested a homeless woman for attempting to kidnap a [ORGANIZATION] girl playing near the trail. [PERSON], a shooting occurred. DATE5, an assailant stabbed a man in the arm before fleeing back into the sea of tents. Unfortunately, [ORGANIZATION] is no exception in [ORGANIZATION] it is a microcosm of [PERSON] largest city. In [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] was home to an estimated 14,000 chronically homeless people, the vast majority of whom were in [ORGANIZATION], according to [ORGANIZATION]. The [ORGANIZATION] [INSTITUTION] has noofficial policy on clearing out the camps or relocating homeless individuals.Third parties now shoulder the burden of coordinating with the city andobtaining police protection in cleaning up the camps. Local officials claim to be pursuingsolutions, but the solutions offered thus far affordable-housingbonds4 and refusing to enforce prohibitions on camping on public rights of [STREET] and in city parks donothing to address the lack of mental-health treatment and drug-abuse problemsat the root of this humanitarian crisis. Nor is this a recent phenomenon. The neglectspans [PERSON]. GPE2 first opened the doors of ORG2 in DATE8 with the aim of treating those afflicted with mentalillness. The facility was meant to relieve overcrowding at the larger statehospital in [PERSON]. More and more individuals flooded into theasylum, and by [PERSON], the newer hospital had also exceeded capacity. Theovercrowding, combined with widespread abuse toward patients, worsened. Rather than reform the mental-healthtreatment system, the state simply closed FAC0 in [LOCATION]0, releasing thepatients ill-equipped to function independently onto the streets of [ORGANIZATION]. [LOCATION]1, the homeless, many of whom are addicted to drugs, remain on thestreets in the same abhorrent conditions.In [ORGANIZATION] alone, [ORGANIZATION] police seized about284 pounds of heroin and [LOCATION]. But those who are afflictedby addiction often never have to confront their habit, at least not due tolegal consequences. [PERSON] drug policy is defined by leniency.Police have neither the resources, nor the backing of their superiors to arrest6an individual for being on drugs in public or for having drugs on their person.In practice, heroin and [LOCATION] are legal. That isnt humane. Its gross governmental dereliction of duty. Resolving the homelessness crisis requires us to acknowledge the humanity of those afflicted. They are not human refuse they are people, albeit badly broken. But fixing the problem requires more than just a token verbal acknowledgment. Part of recognizing their humanity is understanding that the homeless are not merely victims of circumstance. They need help taking the first steps toward reclaiming their lives. The situation has gotten so bad that it nowdemands aggressive action at both the city and state levels. The police must beempowered to disperse these camps. Courts should require those in violation ofdrug laws to seek treatment. Community detox centers in [ORGANIZATION] shouldbecome core to the solution. These centers already offer the homeless trainingin job and social skills. These locally based organizations directly target drugand mental illness issues, but they are underutilized because the city has turneda blind eye to illicit-drug use and continues to tolerate [STREET] camping. Another key part of the solution is to give renewed focus to mental health treatment. Sometimes, that may require at least a temporary respite from independent living. Both the general population and the homeless are put at risk by the current situation. To better serve these individuals, we must remove the stigma surrounding mental-health treatment and replace it with understanding. That may be the only hope for these individuals to regain safe, productive lives. The post Why [ORGANIZATION]s Homeless Problem Is the Worst in the Nation7 appeared first on [ORGANIZATION].

portland,2021-09-25T00:00:00Z,Naked Capitalism,KGW,homelessness,[ORGANIZATION] a Better Chance of Success,"Nevertheless, advocates of police reform have been working to implement lasting reforms, with not much success. This article takes stock and suggests a [STREET] forward. By [ORGANIZATION], Assistant Professor of [ORGANIZATION] and Criminology, [ORGANIZATION] and PERSON1, Clinical Instructor of [ORGANIZATION] and Criminology, [ORGANIZATION]. Originally published at [ORGANIZATION] talks over police reform ended with no agreement2 on [ORGANIZATION], with ORG2 Democrats and Republicans blaming each other for the lack of progress. It isnt the first time that reform at a federal [ORGANIZATION] has been attempted - nor the first time it has [PERSON]. The sticking [ORGANIZATION] this time appear to be centered around proposed changes to use-of-force procedures and plans to strip officers of qualified [ORGANIZATION], which shields them from being sued. As scholars of criminal justice7 - one a former police officer of [ORGANIZATION] - we were not surprised by the collapse of bipartisan talks. Policing in the [ORGANIZATION] is politicized, making it harder to reach consensus in an age of polarization, even though most Americans believe that major [PERSON] are needed. In determining the magnitude of this failure, it is important to keep in mind that policing in the [ORGANIZATION] is inherently local. The nearly 18,000 police departments10 in the country face a variety of different issues, ranging from problems recruiting enough officers - and of a sufficient caliber - to a breakdown of trust with the community. Even without legislation from [ORGANIZATION], there is a national blueprint11 for police reform. President [PERSON] set out six pillars to guide departments toward better practices. Those included strategies to build trust with the community, provide oversight, implement better training and procedures, and improve officer safety and well-being. The federal government can play a clear role in regard to financing reform and addressing nonpolicing issues that contribute to crime, such as underlying poverty and the lack of green spaces. In [DATE] after the 911 attacks, the federal government made funding available13 for local departments to buy military-grade weapons and vehicles through [ORGANIZATION] and ORG6. The federal government might now be better placed playing a similar role as a funder for local law enforcement reforms. City by City While reform has stalled in [ORGANIZATION], there has been movement14elsewhere. Steps toward reform are underway in many [ORGANIZATION] cities, including [PERSON], [PERSON] and GPE4, Oregon17. Many of these efforts18 are geared toward ending specific practices, including those that tripped up negotiations in [ORGANIZATION], such as the granting of qualified immunity19 and the use of no-knock warrants20. Mayors and city councils nationwide have also pushed reforms emphasizing accountability and transparency21, with many working to create independent oversight [DATE]. From [PERSON], GPE6, to GPE7, GPE2 and [PERSON], numerous city police departments have undergone transformation efforts following controversial police killings. Not all of the reform movements have lived up to their promises. After the shooting death of unarmed teen PERSON3 in [LOCATION], police in [PERSON] agreed to a reform program24 that included anti-bias training and an agreement to end stop, search and arrest practices that discriminate on the basis of race. But [PERSON] into the process, a report by the nonprofit Forward Through [PERSON]25 found the reforms had done little to change policing culture or [LOCATION]. This was backed up by a [PERSON] Civilian Review Board report in DATE5 that found the disparity in traffic stops between Black and white residents appears to be growing. Similarly, concerns over the quality of GPE7s police services persist28 despite federal oversight and reforms brought on after the death of PERSON4 in police custody in [ORGANIZATION]. Commentators have pointed to a resistance to change30 among officers and an inability to garner community buy-in31 as reasons for the slowdown in progress in GPE7. Part of the problem, as seen with GPE7, is that federal intervention does not appear to guarantee lasting [ORGANIZATION]. Research [PERSON] that ORG9 regulations aimed at reform only slightly reduce police misconduct. There is also no evidence that national efforts targeting the use of force alone mitigate police [PERSON]. [ORGANIZATION] beacon of hope is ORG10. [PERSON], residents in [LOCATION] experienced events similar to what many cities have faced in [LOCATION]. An unarmed Black man, PERSON5, was shot dead by officers in DATE9, sparking widespread unrest. It led [LOCATION] to enter into a different model of reform a collaborative agreement36. Touted by former [ORGANIZATION] Attorney General [PERSON] as a national model for community-led police reform37, the collaborative agreement saw the [INSTITUTION], civic government, police unions and local civil rights groups act in partnership for a reform program backed by [STREET] supervision. The resulting changes to use-of-force policies, a focus on community-based solutions to crime and robust oversight brought about improved policing. A [ORGANIZATION]0 ORG11 evaluation38 of the collaborative agreement found that it resulted in a reduction in crime, positive changes in citizens attitudes toward police and fewer racially biased traffic stops. There were also fewer use-of-force incidents and officer and arrestee injuries39. But it isnt perfect. [LOCATION]s Black residents continue to be disproportionately arrested - likely owing to the concentration of crime, service calls and police deployments in predominantly Black neighborhoods. Figures from [ORGANIZATION]1 show Black [LOCATION] residents were roughly three times40 as likely to be arrested as their white counterparts. [LOCATION]s collaborative agreement contained a number of elements that experts say are needed if police reforms are to be successful strong leadership flexible, goal-oriented approaches effective oversight and externally regulated transparency. Moreover, it depended on police officials ability to cultivate community [ORGANIZATION] and overcome resistance from police officers and police unions. Community confidence is critical to police reform and community safety42. When citizens view police as legitimate and trustworthy, they are more likely to report crimes, cooperate during police investigations, comply with directives and work with police to find solutions to crime. ORG13 Efforts like those in [LOCATION] that put community engagement at the heart of police reforms undoubtedly are strides in the right direction. But they can go only so far. A noticeable shortcoming in most police reform programs is a focus on what is the right thing to do during confrontations with the public, rather than on trying to avert those situations in the first [STREET]. Fatal police shootings43 often happen during police stops and arrests - situations that carry increased risks44 of citizen resistance and violent police response. Scaling back low-level enforcement, such as arrests for vagrancy and loitering - much of which has little public safety advantage45- and having police partner with civilian responders for mental health, homelessness and drug-related calls, could mean fewer opportunities for violent police encounters46. Some departments have begun to change their enforcement policies along these lines. ORG14 in GPE10, for example, stopped making arrests and issuing citations for misdemeanor [PERSON]. A [ORGANIZATION]1 study48 of traffic stops in GPE11, GPE12, found that redirecting enforcement away from minor infractions - such as broken taillights and expired tags - and toward the more serious violations of speeding and running traffic lights resulted in reduced crime and a narrowed racial gap in stops and searches. Isolated successes suggest that a localized approach emphasizing community buy-in may be key to police reform. That is not to say that the federal government cant play a role - just that it may be better off looking at ways to help facilitate change at a departmental or citywide level. 38utm_mediumfeedamp38utm_campaignFeednakedcapitalism28nakedcapitalism29This entry was posted in [ORGANIZATION] Post49, Income disparity50, [ORGANIZATION] on [ORGANIZATION]2 by [ORGANIZATION].  1  2  3 38contextflr  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40 stateOhioamp38agency[LOCATION]20Police20Departmentamp38categoryall_arrests_totalamp38subcategorytotamp38subsubcategoryRaceamp38ratetrueamp38percentfalseamp38monthlyfalseamp38checkbox_1falseamp38checkbox_2falseamp38checkbox_3falseamp38checkbox_4falseamp38checkbox_1true  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54"

[ORGANIZATION] like that in [ORGANIZATION]1 that put community engagement at the heart of police reforms undoubtedly are strides in the right direction. But they can go only so far. A noticeable shortcoming in most police reform programs is a focus on what is the right thing to do during confrontations with the public, rather than on trying to avert those situations in the first [STREET]. Fatal police shootings39 often happen during police stops and arrests - situations that carry increased risks40 of citizen resistance and violent police response. Scaling back low-level enforcement, such as arrests for vagrancy and loitering - much of which has little public safety advantage41- and having police partner with civilian responders for mental health, homelessness and drug-related calls, could mean fewer opportunities for violent police encounters42. Some departments have begun to change their enforcement policies along these lines. [ORGANIZATION]1 in [ORGANIZATION]2, for example, stopped making arrests and issuing citations for [PERSON] possession43. A [LOCATION]2 study44 of traffic stops in [ORGANIZATION]3, [ORGANIZATION]4, found that redirecting enforcement away from minor infractions - such as broken taillights and expired tags - toward the more serious violations of speeding and running traffic lights resulted in reduced crime and a narrowed racial gap in stops and searches. Removing the [PERSON] Low-level infractions have often been the triggers for police interventions that end in citizen [LOCATION]. PERSON8 - who died in [DATE] after a [ORGANIZATION]5 police officer put him in a banned [LOCATION] - was stopped for selling loose cigarettes47. Devoting less time to policing such activity would also free up officers time to devote to such endeavors as analyzing crime trends, conducting wellness checks on elderly residents and mentoring community youth. PERSON9 felt this as a police officer on the [STREET], and I see it as a criminal justice scholar now. The examples of [ORGANIZATION]1, [ORGANIZATION] and [LOCATION] show that getting community buy-in is crucial if attempts to improve policing are to be successful. We believe that evaluating officers performance and rewarding them based on community-oriented activities - rather than just the number of stops and arrests - could foster the support necessary for lasting reform.38utm_mediumfeedamp38utm_campaignFeedNakedCapitalism28nakedcapitalism29 This entry was posted in [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION] Post49, Income disparity50, [ORGANIZATION] on [LOCATION]3 by [PERSON]0.  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36 stateOhioamp38agency[ORGANIZATION]120Police20Departmentamp38categoryall_arrests_totalamp38subcategorytotamp38subsubcategoryRaceamp38ratetrueamp38percentfalseamp38monthlyfalseamp38checkbox_1falseamp38checkbox_2falseamp38checkbox_3falseamp38checkbox_4falseamp38checkbox_1true  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54"

So many people that I hear from cant understand why I am so negative about the future, because they are completely convinced that really great [LOCATION] are just around the corner. As odd as this may sound, we are seeing this sort of wild optimism among both Democrats and Republicans, Christians and atheists, capitalists and communists. Of course about half the country will have their optimistic hopes for the future brutally crushed by the results of the upcoming election, but we arent there yet. For now, both sides are absolutely convinced that they are going to win, and both sides are envisioning a wonderful new era for our nation in which their values reign triumphant. If only things were that easy. The truth is that many of our largest problems have been steadily growing for DATE2, and they arent going to magically disappear just because a particular candidate wins an election. Our debt levels are absolutely exploding, our economy has plunged into a depression, there is widespread civil unrest in our streets, our nation is more divided than it has ever been in my entire lifetime, and our society is literally coming apart at the seams as just about every form of evil that you can possibly imagine is growing rapidly all around us. But there are a whole lot of people out there that want to stick their heads in the sand and pretend that everything is going to be just fine. If you would like to be just like them, the following are 20 things that you must believe in order to convince yourself that everything is going to turn out okay somehow96 [PERSON]1 [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]5l for [PERSON]0 to Revoke [ORGANIZATION] Authors Prize97 Twenty-one distinguished scholars in higher education and research published a letter calling for [PERSON]1 editor [PERSON] to lose her [ORGANIZATION] prize for her controversial [ORGANIZATION] series that many have deemed revisionist history.

Its 449-page report criticizes these companies for buying competitors, preferencing their own services, and holding outsized power over smaller businesses that use their platforms. Our investigation revealed an alarming pattern of business practices that degrade competition and stifle innovation, said committee member PERSON[PERSON]2 D-[PERSON]0. Competition must reward the best idea, not the biggest corporate account. We will take steps necessary to hold rulebreakers accountable. The majoritys report lays out a number of concrete policy recommendations, which, taken together, would drastically change how the tech industry operates. It urges [PERSON]3G33 to consider passing commercial nondiscrimination rules that would make large companies offer equal terms to companies selling products and services on their platforms. It recommends barring certain dominant platforms from competing in adjacent lines of business where theyd have a huge advantage. To put it simply, companies that once were scrappy, underdog startups that challenged the status quo have become the kinds of monopolies we last saw in the era of oil barons and railroad tycoons, the report says. By controlling access to markets, these giants can pick winners and losers throughout our economy. They not only wield tremendous power, but they also abuse it by charging exorbitant fees, imposing oppressive contract terms, and extracting valuable data from the people and businesses that rely on them.122 [ORGANIZATION] Officer Allegedly Pulls Knife on [ORGANIZATION] Supporters123 [PERSON]1, [LOCATION] [PERSON]6  A political rally in [PERSON]2 turned ugly over [LOCATION]6 when a man pulled out a knife and threatened [ORGANIZATION] supporters.

PERSON18 is calling for Mayor PERSONDATE52 to get it under control, but city officials say liberal pushes to defund the police have hindered the [ORGANIZATION]1s ability to keep the city safe. Defunding the police is perhaps the worst idea in [PERSON]5 government history, Democrat [ORGANIZATION]man PERSON35 told [ORGANIZATION]0. We cant legislate using fashionable slogans that fit on protest signs. It hurts every [PERSON]er. The [ORGANIZATION]1 are the gold standard for law enforcement around the world.

These are mostly symptoms of the common cold or flu. So why was he subjected to experimental drugs and procedures? And why was hydroxychloroquine taken off the table?

The flu can include some of these factors plus fatigue. Based on his own experience with the disease, [ORGANIZATION] issued a statement comparing coronavirus to the flu. That was significant. But [PERSON]3G65 companies [PERSON]3G66 and [PERSON]3G36 immediately censored him. As if we needed more evidence, it should be clear by now that [PERSON]3G65 and certain political forces are determined to convince the public that [PERSON]-19 is not a flu-like illness. Taking guidance from [PERSON]3G67, a Chinese puppet, they want people to be scared. By contrast, [ORGANIZATION] wanted to reassure people that they can fight and beat the disease, like he did.178 [ORGANIZATION] Campaign Reserves Seat at [ORGANIZATION] for PERSON82 After [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]5led Him Her Favorite Rapper Alive179 The [ORGANIZATION] campaign has left a ticket for dead rapper PERSON82 [PERSON] at [PERSON] nights Vice Presidential debate, in reference to Democrat vice presidential candidate [PERSON] bizarre statement that PERSON82 is her favorite rapper alive.180 Video PERSON11 Makes Racist [PERSON] About Black Women Stocking Grocery Shelves181 Democratic candidate [ORGANIZATION] put his foot in his mouth once again recently, this time making a comment that had it come from President [ORGANIZATION]s mouth would have sent leftists into a frothing meltdown, given that it was straight up racist.

Why arent good [ORGANIZATION]ns at school board meetings demanding objective teaching in our schools? Why arent parents pouring through textbooks to see what public education is teaching their children and demanding the textbooks be re-written to fit reality and truth. If the parents started reading textbooks they will be shocked and demand change. What price a childs mind? They have taken over our colleges where free thought, new ideas and thoughtful debate are supposed to be the hallmarks of a good education. But instead, college deans, boards, professors and staff limit all ideas and all curriculums to only [ORGANIZATION] socialist ideas while censoring any other ideas, sometimes with violence. Meanwhile, good [ORGANIZATION]ns that send their kids to these dens of socialism seem oblivious to the mindset shift to Progressivism that has been taking [STREET] before their very eyes, for several generations. How can public education be any better than the teachers being taught at our liberal colleges? In fact, where did [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]9 Standards come from but from the graduates of our one-sided liberal colleges? Who writes the textbooks for public education but those educated idiots that come out of [ORGANIZATION] liberal academia? If only God would spare [ORGANIZATION]ns the utterances and expert advice of over-educated aristocrats of higher education that throw common sense and logic to the far winds. Theyre allowing hordes of illegal aliens to swarm our country, take our jobs and burn up billions of our social service dollars with no consequences and good [ORGANIZATION]ns watch and do nothing. It turns out that the law only applies to the good people of [ORGANIZATION]. Criminals, corrupt politicians, bureaucrats and illegal aliens are exempt from the law. Why arent [PERSON]0 and [ORGANIZATION] in jail? Why do good [ORGANIZATION]ns stand for this injustice?184 [PERSON]3G36 Bans Alternative Media Outlet [PERSON]3G69 [PERSON]3G36 has started deleting pages and groups on the platform that were supporting [PERSON]5.

Regrettably, some member states and the LOC2an [PERSON]3G95 try to reopen the [LOCATION]9 conclusions of the LOC2an [ORGANIZATION] and jeopardize the adoption of the legislative package, PERSON95 wrote. Those who never really supported the economic recovery of LOC2 are now using rule of law conditionality, completely absent from the LOC2an [ORGANIZATION] conclusions, as a pretext to dismantle the agreement.192 [ORGANIZATION] Prices Soar [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] Up 54 of Cost193 Thanks to the [ORGANIZATION] transition to green energies, which is tantamount to a vegan energy diet, [LOCATION]1s electricity prices have soared 27 over DATE48 to become the most expensive in LOC2, if not the world, according to [PERSON]3G86.

The [PERSON]23 building has been a frequent location for ongoing protests in [ORGANIZATION]3 [LOCATION]8.[PERSON]28 A New [PERSON]3G33ional Report Proves That the Institutions of Marriage and Family Are Being Systematically Destroyed in [ORGANIZATION][PERSON]29 The numbers that I am about to share with you are extremely sobering, and they should be a massive wake up call for all of us. [LOCATION], I wrote an article about how our society is breaking down everywhere we look, and nowhere is this more evident than in our marriages and in our families. But without strong marriages and strong families, no society can thrive for long. Recently, ORG125 of ORG126 Republicans released a report entitled The Demise of the Happy Two-Parent [ORGANIZATION], but you probably never heard about it until now because it was almost entirely ignored by the mainstream media. I have never seen a congressional report document the collapse of marriage and family in [ORGANIZATION]n society to such an extent, and to be honest it is quite surprising to see such a quality piece of work come out of [DATE].260 [ORGANIZATION] From [ORGANIZATION]261 The lockdown-skeptic group [ORGANIZATION] has recently lost its [ORGANIZATION] account after it was shut down by the company for allegedly spreading false narratives about [PERSON]-19. ORG130 did not take down the videos uploaded by the group and said that it hadnt violated any of its platform rules, but [ORGANIZATION] thought otherwise. [ORGANIZATION] had reportedly raised nearly 30,000 before it got suspended. The group has racked more than 10,000 subscribers and nearly half a million views on ORG130.262 [STREET] Rules in Favor of [ORGANIZATION] Threatened by [PERSON] LGBT Law263 [PERSON] District [STREET] Judge [PERSON]2, an [PERSON]8 appointee, told the [PERSON] Office of Children and Family Services that it could not shut down a Christian adoption agency simply due to the agencys policy of only placing children with heterosexual couples.264 Cultural [PERSON]4isms Origins How the Disciples of an Obscure Italian Linguist Subverted [LOCATION]65 You may have heard the terms Cultural [PERSON]4ism, [ORGANIZATION] or [ORGANIZATION] bandied about. And while you might have an intuitive approximation of what these terms mean for [ORGANIZATION] in the [PERSON]1st century, theres a good chance that you dont know much about the deep theory, where the ideology comes from and what it has planned for [ORGANIZATION]  and the world. The underlying theory here is a variant of [PERSON]4ism, pioneered by DATE91 Italian [PERSON]4ist politician and linguist [PERSON]3. [PERSON]6an [PERSON]4ism is a radical departure from Classical [PERSON]4ism. One does not need to endorse the Classical [PERSON]4ism of [PERSON]4, [PERSON]5 and others to appreciate the significant differences between the two. He is easily the most influential thinker that you have never heard of. Whereas Classical [PERSON]4ism located what has been called the revolutionary subject the people who will overthrow capitalism and usher in socialism within the broad working class, primarily in what is now [PERSON], [PERSON]6sm takes a very different approach. This approach underpins most of the social unrest that is gripping [ORGANIZATION] and the [PERSON]0 toDATE58. In a sense, we are living through the endgame of a [PERSON]6an revolution. There are two important diversions that [PERSON]6sm has from more traditional [PERSON]4ist thought First, that economics was the base of culture and politics. Second, philosophical materialism in the [PERSON]4ist sense where reality is effectively formed by the means of economic production. For [PERSON]6, culture was more important than either economics or politics. This was what needed to be changed for there to be a revolution. As such, the weapon to be used for revolution was not the economic might of an organized working class, but a long march through the institutions a phrase actually coined by German [PERSON]4ist [PERSON]7, whereby every institution in the [PERSON]0 would be subverted through penetration and infiltration. Throughout this article, we will use the term Cultural [PERSON]4ism as a catchall to refer to this phenomenon, because it is the most all-encompassing and does not limit us to discussing any one specific variation [PERSON]6, the [ORGANIZATION] or what have you. Finally, we should briefly mention that, the claims of [PERSON]. [PERSON]8 notwithstanding, Cultural [PERSON]4ism is ideologically distinct from postmodernism and deconstruction, both of which are hostile toward [PERSON]4ism. We will not touch on either postmodernism or deconstruction in this article, though they certainly have been influential on the international left.266 [ORGANIZATION] to [STREET] ORG135 Indicted by [PERSON]4 Grand Jury for Lewd Depiction of Children in [LOCATION] Film267 ORG135s streaming of [PERSON] led to a boycott campaign and calls by members of [PERSON]3G33 for federal prosecutors to investigate the movie as child porn.268 [PERSON]9, W.H.O.

Those who have signed include professors from the worlds leading universities. [LOCATION]3 University professor [PERSON] PERSON141 was one of the authors of the open letter that was sent with the petition, along with ORG139 [PERSON] PERSON142 and ORG140 [PERSON] PERSON143. It declares that social distancing and mask mandates are causing damaging physical and mental health impacts.272 ORG130 and [ORGANIZATION], Alleging to Show Hospital Refusing Care273 ORG142, a non-profit organization had uploaded a video on ORG130 and [ORGANIZATION] where newly born twins were allegedly denied treatment in a hospital, resulting in their death. Both of the video-sharing platforms ended up taking the video down, with [ORGANIZATION] even suspending [LOCATION] account. ORG130 said that the video had violated its community standards, whereas [ORGANIZATION] stated that it had violated its guidelines. Oddly, [ORGANIZATION]s given reason for the ban was, You cannot upload videos that are hateful, defamatory, or discriminatory.274 Growing Metallic Crystals in Liquid Metal275 Imagine an alien world with oceans of liquid metal If such a world exists, metallic elements are likely the sources of the dissolved materials and particles in these oceans.

In fact, we are in worse shape, since [PERSON] is supposed to be the leader of [ORGANIZATION], an example to other countries. [ORGANIZATION] has one set of electronic voting machines, and we have another. Thats the difference. Plus, the mail-in voting schemes that President [ORGANIZATION] warned about were utilized as well. That makes [PERSON]s elections even more suspicious. In [PERSON] we have an [PERSON] which serves LOC2.

However, in a surprising report out of [LOCATION], the bank finds no meaningful curve development differences between countries with and without strong curve intervention. This makes the bank question if existing public health intervention i.e., lockdown stricter social distancing should remain in [STREET] DATE[ORGANIZATION]3, and leads ORG33 to conclude that public health policy should consider approaches biased towards economicpubic mental health over the urge to close the curve in [ORGANIZATION]321.103 [PERSON]5 Councilwoman Faces Calls to Resign for Anti-PERSON8 [LOCATION] [ORGANIZATION]1104 DATE21 is over in the [PERSON]1, but the high drama and all sorts of controversies continue to play out on social media, where yet another official, a member of the [PERSON]6, [PERSON]5 city council is now under pressure to resign for her [LOCATION] post. [PERSON]3 posted on the giant social network [LOCATION], causing not only debates between people holding different opinions  but as has become customary, those disagreeing with the councilor are asking for her head  i.e., her resignation. The post that caused the furor showed [PERSON] and members of his campaign celebrating their declared victory in the [PERSON]1 election, as [PERSON]4 asked ironically if this is what makes [PERSON]ns feel proud  and described some of the people in the picture as, crack pot little girl [PERSON]5 and creepy sell out [PERSON]7 Joe.105 Promise Broken PERSON8 Pledged Not to [PERSON]clare Victory Until Election Independently Certified106 With the media declaring [PERSON] president elect, and PERSON8 himself forming a transitional team, it sure seems that his promise in [LOCATION]2 to allow the election to be independently certified before claiming victory was empty rhetoric. During the first Presidential debate PERSON8 was asked by [PERSON]6 Will you urge your supporters to stay calm while the vote is counted, and will you pledge not to declare victory until the election is independently certified?

Now they happen with such shocking frequency that [STREET] crews have standard procedures for blocking the highways so police can search for evidence. And drivers see them mostly as frustrating incidents that wreak havoc with their [TIME] commutes. And thats wrong.

DATE[PERSON]3, the PERSON39 government announced a technical paper on its proposed federal carbon tax which suggests it will mimic [PERSON]8s carbon tax plan, quashing the optimism of those who believed the federal government when they said their carbon tax would be revenue neutral. The federal government had long insisted its plan would be revenue neutral for the federal government, with any revenue generated staying in the province where the tax is imposed. [LOCATION]7, [PERSON]7-based federal [ORGANIZATION] Minister PERSON40, said publicly of the planned federal carbon tax that every single penny remains in [PERSON]7 and under [PERSON]7s control. The [PERSON]7 government was highly skeptical-as it turns out, for good reason. When [PERSON]8s government announced its own multi-billion-dollar carbon tax, Premier PERSON41 and other ministers tried to spin the tax as revenue neutral. In all previous uses of this term, it meant that every dollar raised by the government would be returned to taxpayers. The [PERSON]8 governments new definition was that every dollar they take from [PERSON]8ns would be spent by the [PERSON]8 government. By that definition, every tax in Canadian history would be considered revenue [ORGANIZATION] TraumatizeMind Control Public57 Terrorism being used as excuse for martial law [ORGANIZATION] from [PERSON]9 reminds us what we are dealing with as far as terrorist attacks are concerned and warns us how the elite will use them as mind control to get the public to usher in a draconian authoritarian style government to feel safe.58 [ORGANIZATION] on GPE20 Bombing59 Thought police blocking public debate over terrorisms root causes Commentary in the wake of [LOCATION]8 bombing jihad in GPE20 is being carefully patrolled, and politically incorrect voices of dissent are being crushed as the GPE21 thought police seek to disguise the root causes of successive terrorist attacks on GPE21 soil. Prominent journalist and talk show host PERSON42 has been forced to leave [ORGANIZATION] radio after comments and tweets she made [ORGANIZATION] were reported to ORG31, who launched an investigation into the matter. ORG30 and PERSON42 have agreed that PERSON43 will leave ORG30 effective immediately, said an ORG30 spokesman. The news of PERSON44 departure from ORG30 comes [LOCATION]9 after it was discovered that authorities were actively investigating the [ORGANIZATION] columnist for her inflammatory tweets. PERSON44 first tweeted, then deleted, about the need for a final solution to the slew of jihadist attacks in the GPE21, later posting a less implicated call for action from [ORGANIZATION]ern men.

They have opened their borders to millions of immigrants with a vastly different culture and belief system. Many are nothing more than cave-dwelling PERSON47s feeding on [PERSON]s submissive and compliant citizenry. Numerous other migrants and their offDATE5 demonstrate resistance and downright refusal to assimilate, living in their own little PERSON47 world of suspicion and hate. The leaders of [PERSON] doggedly assure their people that everything is normal. The mayor of GPE20 mutters Its business as usual. Business as usual? Is this what it has come tototal acquiescencethe new normal? Most leaders in [PERSON], and many in [LOCATION], have proven themselves to be impotent. People die violent deaths while they strut around as if they have the answers, but they have no answers. They have no solutions. GPE23 had the opportunity to confront their situation in their recent presidential election, but chose to take a higher roadthe [STREET] of denial, the [STREET] of living in the dream world where you confront the people who want to kill you with, as PERSON48 recently said, the greatest thing we can do is just unite and love on each other. No barriers, no borders, we all just need to co-exist. These are people that truly believe the greatest threat we face is not ORG34 or ORG35, but climate change. These are not rational people. They refuse to accept and confront what is plainly in front of them, especially the ones who live behind walled mansions. They do not belong in leadership or influential positions. They belong in theoretical think tanks where they can only inspire each other.62 Only 7 of 3,000 Extremists in GPE24 Are Under [ORGANIZATION] to [PERSON] Only seven extremists have been placed under anti-terror orders watered down at the behest of the ORGDATE47 despite there being at least 3,000 fanatics at large in GPE24.

While many still view communism as a noble philosophy that may yet be implemented given improvements in technology or human nature, its ideological foundations depict not a utopian dream but a necessarily violent and destructive teaching. Since its emergence, communist ideologies have promoted violent revolution and brutal dictatorships far outstripping the worst excesses of non-communist governments.

A German tailor named [ORGANIZATION]3 joined the society after arriving in [LOCATION] in 18[LOCATION]2, according to [ORGANIZATION]4, and soon became one of the best known communist figures of DATE23. [ORGANIZATION]5 took [ORGANIZATION]2s ideas of violent revolution, state-enforced equality, and the destruction of ownership and, according to [ORGANIZATION]4, infused these with his own ideas of a PERSON33 apocalyptic vision. Under him, ORG37 also changed its name to ORG38. Many radical secret societies existed in [PERSON] at the time, and many figures and newspapers were spreading the new ideas of socialism and communism. This held especially true in [LOCATION], which saw many attempted revolutions throughout DATE24. ORG39 joined the DATE25 Blanquist rebellion, led by [ORGANIZATION]7. He would later become leader of what may be regarded as the first communist government, the [LOCATION] Commune of DATE26, which waged a program of killing and destruction that in DATE27 left tens of thousands dead and [DATE] of [LOCATION] and its cultural relics in ruins.68 The [LOCATION] Commune When the Specter Came to LOCDATE479 Like a funnel cloud longing to touch [PERSON] and become a tornado, the specter of [LOCATION]2 was up in the air, with no [PERSON]ly home, haunting [PERSON] in [DATE].

There is a specter haunting [PERSON], wrote [ORGANIZATION]8 in [ORGANIZATION]. In [LOCATION], this specter gained the foothold from which it could wreak its own lethal tornado of destruction and killing for [PERSON]0 to come. The [LOCATION] Commune was shortly endorsed by [ORGANIZATION]9 as the first proletariat revolution, or dictatorship of the proletariat. Its influence as a model echoed all the [STREET] to [PERSON]0 and [PERSON]1, who studied and learned lessons from it.70 GPE21 Terrorism Threat Reduced After Wave of Police Raids Targeting [PERSON] British Prime Minister [PERSON]2 reduced the terrorism threat level in the GPE21 from critical to severe [PERSON], with armed soldiers patrolling streets across the country to be withdrawn beginning [PERSON]1 evening.72 GPE21 Open Your Eyes Family of GPE20 Bombing Victim Warn Government of Terror Deaths73 In a statement praising [PERSON]2 [PERSON]3 and thanking the emergency services for their response to the horrific incident, her family lashed out at the [ORGANIZATION] handling of terror threats.

[PERSON]5 the [ORGANIZATION] told the harrowing story of the gangs victim, a private schoolgirl who said she kept quiet during the terrifying attack because she feared the consequences of protesting. I just stayed quiet because I thought they would kill me if I screamed, she said. Any one of them could have had a knife. Nobody else knew I was there.

Speaking on the show [ORGANIZATION], PERSON82, elucidated that [LOCATION]8 is synonymous with radicalism. There is nothing like soft [LOCATION]8, said the GPE70 priest. There is no difference between [LOCATION]8 and [LOCATION]8ic radicalism. [LOCATION]8 is radical. There is no soft [LOCATION]8. [LOCATION]8 is about [ORGANIZATION] direction.

[LOCATION] [ORGANIZATION]1-6132 [ORGANIZATION] is the Only Solution to the Problem Posed by [ORGANIZATION],  Says Spokesman of Banned Generation Identity133 You were ORG71 spokesperson, but on [ORGANIZATION]4 the government banned your organization. What does this mean in practice? [ORGANIZATION] is no longer active. The ban was pronounced in [LOCATION] and we have filed two cases against that decision with ORG74, which is GPE48s highest administrative [STREET] the first one is a petition for suspension with the aim of suspending the ban for the time it will take ORG74 to rule over our second case concerning the legality of the ban. The petition for suspension will be judged on [ORGANIZATION]5 and we will then know whether ORG75 will be able to continue its activity during the proceedings, which could last [ORGANIZATION]6. Do you have confidence in ORG74 as the highest instance of administrative justice? Many in GPE48 believe that ORG74 is not totally independent of the government. That is a pretty hard question to answer. If the judgment is rendered based on the law, we are extremely confident. However, if politics takes precedence over the law, then we have every reason to be concerned. In theory, ORG74 is supposed to base its rulings on the law, and we will have a first look at this on [ORGANIZATION]5. The ruling on our petition for suspension procedure will be decided on collegially by three judges, which happens extremely rarely since most often there is only one judge to make such a decision. This shows that the case is taken very seriously.134 GPE72 Man Cleared of Planning Terror Attack on Gay Pride135 A [ORGANIZATION]7 man from GPE72 has been sentenced to [ORGANIZATION]8 in jail to be followed by compulsory psychiatric treatment for making threats against gay people, Jews and the police on social media but was found not guilty of planning a terrorist attack.

[PERSON] said that the German public debt rose by 11.1, or 210.1 billion euros, compared with [ORGANIZATION]. The former record high of 2,068.3 billion euros was measured on [ORGANIZATION]. The increase is mainly due to the fact that the public budgets borrowed funds for the purpose of financing measures to overcome the coronavirus crisis, [PERSON] noted. The data on public debt refers to the debts of the overall public budget [LOCATION], regions, municipalitiesassociations of municipalities and social security funds including all extra budgets to the non-public sector credit institutions and the remaining domestic and non-domestic sector.117 [ORGANIZATION] Adds 661,000 Jobs in [LOCATION] and Unemployment Rate Falls to 7.91[LOCATION] The numbers The [ORGANIZATION] created 661,000 new jobs in [LOCATION] and the unemployment rate fell again to 7.9 to the lowest level of the pandemic, but the gain in hiring was the smallest since the economy reopened and pointed to deceleration in the recovery.119 11 Children Recovered in GPE4 During [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] Operation Summer Rescue120 Eleven children were recovered by the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] in a [ORGANIZATION] rescue operation in GPE4 called Operation Summer Rescue [DATE]9, which focused on missing and endangered runaways. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] said several arrests were made during the childrens recoveries over the operation, which ran from [DATE] 1 to [LOCATION] 30.121 A Swarm of Nearly 600 Earthquakes [PERSON] as Speculation About The Big One Starts to Rise Again122 Over [LOCATION]1, a swarm of almost 600 earthquakes has shaken southern [PERSON], and a lot of people are becoming extremely concerned about what will happen next. In fact, if you go on ORG7 right now you will find a tremendous amount of speculation that the Big One could be coming. The experts are trying to calm the general public by assuring them that it is probably not likely that the Big One is imminent, but they dont know for sure. Forecasting earthquakes is not like forecasting the weather, and experts will continue to tell us that a major event is not likely until [LOCATION]2 when one finally happens. But what everyone can agree upon is that earthquake swarms cause the probability of a major event to rise. Of course that doesnt mean that there will be a major event associated with this current earthquake swarm, and there may not be a major event if an earthquake swarm occurs [LOCATION]3. But without a doubt what is going on in southern [PERSON] right now is worth watching.123 GPE6 and [PERSON] in the Balance1[DATE] The Crossroads of GPE6n History Have you looked around GPE6 lately? Do you even recognize the nation that you grew up in? How could a nation founded on PERSON75tian principles so easily yield to the forces of darkness? How has THE [ORGANIZATION] become so oblivious to what is going on around us? How can we not understand that the [ORGANIZATION] is trying to destroy everything that is good? How can we not understand that what we are facing is a war for the very soul of this nation? The battle is not POLITICALbut it involves politics. This is the most consequential moment in GPE6n historyat least since the signing of the Declaration of Independence. GPE7 IS AT WAR!125 Anti-Defamation League Circulates Petition Urging Jews to [ORGANIZATION] [LOCATION]5126 [ORGANIZATION] is circulating a petition among Jewish organizations urging them to criticize President [PERSON] for failing to denounce white supremacy during the first presidential debate on [LOCATION]4  though he did so then, and has done so, often, before.127 ORG9 [PERSON] Not to Describe Democrat Riots as Riots128 Left-leaning news org coordinates reporting to cover for radical leftist violence.129 As Many as 50 of [ORGANIZATION], Restaurants May Close Permanently Amid Continued [PERSON]-19 Restrictions130 As many as half of GPE8 bars and restaurants may close for good in [LOCATION]5, according to a newly released report by the states comptroller. The citys restaurant industry has been operating under severe restrictions for [LOCATION]6 and were allowed to resume indoor dining [LOCATION]7 at a maximum capacity of 25.131 Black [ORGANIZATION]3 Destroy Left-Wing Lies, [ORGANIZATION] White Supremacy132 We are not a white supremacist group.133 [PERSON] Gov. [PERSON] Reopening Rules Again, Adds Racial Equity Measures134 [PERSON]s Governor [PERSON], who is PERSON9 nephew, is once again moving the goalposts in order to keep his state shut down, imposing irrelevant criteria to delay recovery. He has become an economic troll. With his state accounting for almost 15 of the national GDP, hobbling his states economy, even as counties are already starting to meet the criteria he set for relaxation of restrictions, depresses national output and employment statistics and thereby contributes to defeating President [LOCATION]5.135 [LOCATION]0 Democrats and [ORGANIZATION] The set-up at the Presidential debate [LOCATION]4 night was so predictable that it hurt to watch. Moderator [LOCATION]1 made no effort to hide where he was going. He noted that President [PERSON] had repeatedly demanded that his opponent, Democratic nominee and former vice president [LOCATION]2 condemn [PERSON]0, the violent leftist group behind much of the ongoing destruction of GPE6s cities. [LOCATION]3 failed to note that [LOCATION]4 refused to condemn [PERSON]0 and instead claimed, crazily that the organization is an idea not a group. [LOCATION]3 then asked [LOCATION]5 to condemn white supremacists and militia groups, and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities. Sure, Im willing to do that, [LOCATION]5 replied. He then added, Almost everything I see is from the left wing, not the right wing. [LOCATION]5 was right, of course. The rioting, looting, arson the attacks on police, on business owners and on citizens sitting in their homes from [PERSON] to GPE11 to GPE12 is the provenance of [PERSON]0, [PERSON]1 and related left-wing groups. Then, going back to [LOCATION]3s question, [LOCATION]5 added, Im willing to do anything. I want to see peace. That didnt satisfy [LOCATION]3, or [LOCATION]4, who were tag-teaming the issue. The two demanded that [LOCATION]5 condemn. [LOCATION]5 asked who specifically they wanted him to condemn. [LOCATION]3 said, White supremacists and militias. [LOCATION]4  who wouldnt condemn the leftist terrorists laying waste to GPE6s urban centers  said, [ORGANIZATION]3. So [LOCATION]5, trying to resonate [LOCATION]3s request that he tell them to stand down, said, [ORGANIZATION]3, stand back and stand by. And the progressive media and Jewish progressive activists clapped their hands in glee. Here was the definitive proof that [LOCATION]5 is a white supremacist137138 [PERSON]2 Says Were Never Getting Back to Normal139 [PERSON]2 has published an article asserting that people need to accept that things are never getting back to normal and that mandatory coronavirus restrictions such as wearing face masks will become permanent. In a piece titled There is no getting back to normal, experts say. The sooner we accept that, the better  [PERSON]2 international security editor [LOCATION]7 writes, Things are most likely never going back to normal. [PERSON] says that the pre-corona world is now mere nostalgia and that the public needs to come to terms with it.140 [PERSON]2s [LOCATION]9 Suggests [LOCATION]5 [PERSON] Was a Hoax141 [PERSON]2s [LOCATION]9 reacted to President [LOCATION]5s announcement that he had tested positive for coronavirus by suggesting it was payback for [LOCATION]5 calling the virus a hoax, something that never happened. The remark was made during [LOCATION]1 discussion with the networks chief medical correspondent [LOCATION]2 Could [LOCATION]5s [LOCATION]virus Test be a False Positive?143 Despite numerous reports from respected public health bodies acknowledging that up to 90 of those testing positive for coronavirus may be wrongly diagnosed, no one is asking whether that could be case when it comes to President [LOCATION]5s [PERSON]-19 infection. [LOCATION]5 announced via ORG7 that he and [LOCATION]3 had tested positive for the virus, prompting a wave of celebration and gloating from leftists who believe it will harm his re-election chances.144 [STREET] [LOCATION]4 Lawsuits Against [PERSON]4, [PERSON]5, [PERSON]6, And [PERSON]7 Can Go Forward145 [LOCATION]4 filed suit against numerous media entities after the false and misleading portrayals of him and his interaction with a Native GPE6n activist who banged a drum inches from [LOCATION]5 face. [LOCATION]6 settled with [PERSON]2 and [PERSON] for undisclosed amounts, his suit against [PERSON]9 survived a motion to dismiss, and there is a pending motion to dismiss in his suit against [LOCATION]7. In an important series of rulings, the federal judge handling the cases just entered orders denying motions to dismiss his cases against the [PERSON]4, [PERSON]5, [PERSON]6, and [PERSON]7. So those cases will move forward.146 [PERSON]-19 Case Number Lies Continue147 A record number of [PERSON]-19 cases were reported on [LOCATION] [DATE] in GPE13. Just two labs reported that there were 2,451 positive test results, but those included old numbers. The lies continue as those who seek ultimate power and control try to lie their [STREET] through this scamdemic. At this point, no numbers from any mainstream media source or government agency should be trusted. Theres more than enough evidence to prove this is all manipulated in order to push fear on the public.148 Declassified Intelligence Report Reveals [LOCATION]8 Hatched the [PERSON] Hoax149 According to a report obtained by ORG21, in response to [LOCATION]9 request for oversight of the reliability of the PERSON30 dossier, ORG22 recently declassified a key footnote in Inspector General PERSON31 report. The footnote states PERSON75topher PERSON30s Primary Sub-source was the subject of an ORG23 counterintelligence investigation from [LOCATION]9 that assessed hisher documented contacts with suspected [PERSON]n intelligence officers. To me, failure of the ORG23 to inform the [STREET] that the Primary Sub-source was suspected of being a [PERSON]n agent is a breach of every duty owed by law enforcement to the judicial system, said PERSON33. The ORG23 summary provided to the committee reveals that the [PERSON] team was aware of this information in [DATE]0, yet failed to inform ORG25 in their affidavits for surveillance warrants on four occasions.150 [LOCATION] GPE15 Jewelry Store Intends to [LOCATION] for Handling of Protests151 GPE16, [LOCATION]  A downtown GPE15 jewelry store owner intends to sue [LOCATION] for its handling of protests in [DATE]1. PERSON34, CEO of ORG26, said her family-owned store was was broken into and looted [TIME] on [DATE]2. This was during the beginning stages of what would lead to [DATE]3 of protest in GPE15. I started looking on my phone to see who was in my store, it was bunch of people going into the store, broke glass, it was the most painful, disheartening experience I ever faced, said PERSON35. The store owner said they are still calculating the costs, but estimates 2.5 million in damages.152 [LOCATION] GPE15 Businesses How Many Open, Closed or Empty153 GPE16, GPE[LOCATION]  Amid the pandemic, protests and a homeless crisis, downtown GPE15s reputation has been the center of some controversy over the last few [LOCATION]6. The [LOCATION] GPE15 Clean amp38 Safe recently conducted a survey of businesses within the 213 blocksthat make up the area. They said they surveyed 7[LOCATION] retail and restaurants throughout the month of [LOCATION]. Their survey found there were over 430 businesses still open, some by appointment only or with adjusted [TIME]. 170 businesses were temporarily closed, or only doing online shopping. Over 20 businesses had permanently closed, and there were over 80 retail locations that were not occupied.154 Federal Affidavit Details Accused [ORGANIZATION] Rioters Ties to [PERSON]0155 An upstate [ORGANIZATION] suspect is facing federal charges for instructing their comrades to make firebombs to harm police in one of the few known cases where federal prosecutors explicitly detail the accuseds ties to [PERSON]0. The [ORGANIZATION] Attorneys Office for [LOCATION] of [ORGANIZATION] charged [DATE]6 PERSON36, of [ORGANIZATION]1, [DATE]7 with using a facility of interstate and foreign commerce to incite, promote and encourage a riot. PERSON37 uses the pronouns PERSON38 and PERSON39 also known as PERSON40 Flashback [LOCATION]1 Mocked [LOCATION]5 in [DATE]8 Interview157 For those wondering whether [LOCATION]1s disastrous moderator performance during [LOCATION]4 [TIME] debate had anything to do with his personal beef with President [LOCATION]5, a [DATE]8 interview provides some context. As we previously highlighted, [LOCATION]3 constantly interrupted the president while interjecting while [LOCATION]4 was speaking 5 times less frequently.158 [ORGANIZATION]7 Man DATE35 In Which [ORGANIZATION]2, [ORGANIZATION]3, And Especially [ORGANIZATION]4 All [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]5 We have never needed [ORGANIZATION]7 Man DATE35 more than right now. There hasnt been much we could count on in [DATE]9, between infectious disease, poisonous politics, a deliberately tanked economy, and a universe that has become practically mirthful  not to mention merciless  in its unpredictability. But there is one thing you can depend upon, DATE30 in and DATE30 out. And thats [ORGANIZATION]6 glorious sunshine law, shining its bright light on the very people who let you say At least it wasnt me. So chins up, people, and join me on another [ORGANIZATION]7 Man DATE35!160 Former ORG7 CEO Says [ORGANIZATION] to be the First To be Shot in the Revolution161 ORG7 has not flagged or removed the tweet Former ORG7 CEO PERSON42 said some capitalists are going to be the first to be shot in the revolution in a tweet [ORGANIZATION]0.162 Former ORG7 CEO Calls for Political Enemies to be Lined Up Against the Wall and Shot163 Former ORG7 CEO PERSON42 has publicly called for people who disagree with him to be lined up against the wall and shot. But theres no [LOCATION] bias, honest! Me-first capitalists who think you can separate society from business are going to be the first people lined up against the wall and shot in the revolution. Ill happily provide video commentary, tweeted PERSON43. PERSON44 pointed out that PERSON43 was in violation of ORG7s own rules regarding the glorification of violence.164 Gov. [ORGANIZATION] Taxpayers wonder how broke [PERSON] will foot the bill.166 Gov. PERSON45 Says [PERSON]-19 App Will Alert [ORGANIZATION]ers of [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] Gov. [PERSON] announced on DATE31 that there is a new smartphone app that can alert residents of [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]3, [ORGANIZATION]8, [ORGANIZATION]9, and [PERSON]0 if they have come in contact with someone who has tested positive for [PERSON]-19.168 Highly Anticipated Grand Jury Recordings of PERSON47 Case Have Been Released169 The highly anticipated recordings of the grand jury proceedings in the fatal shooting of PERSON47 have been released by [PERSON]1 Attorney General PERSON48. According to [PERSON]1, the audio includes officers testimony that they knocked on PERSON49 door multiple times and announced the police presence before entering.170 If Democrats Take [PERSON]2 and [PERSON]3 in DATE32, It Will All be Over for [PERSON]4 This is not a normal election, because if Democrats are able to win [PERSON]2, the [PERSON]5 and [PERSON]6 in DATE32, they will end the two party system as we know it [PERSON]. Yes, there will still be two major political parties, but one will essentially be in permanent control. In [DATE], there has been so much chatter on the left about ending the filibuster in the [PERSON]5 permanently, about granting statehood to [PERSON]2 and [PERSON]3, and about packing [PERSON]7. Collectively, these three moves would basically make it exceedingly difficult for Republicans to ever become the majority party again. I know that this is an extreme statement to make, but I think that you will agree with me by the time this article is over. Lets talk about the filibuster in the [PERSON]5 and statehood for [PERSON]4 and [PERSON]3 first. When PERSON50 of MS[PERSON]9 asked PERSON51 about these potential moves if Democrats win the [PERSON]5, [PERSON] said that everything is on the table172 [PERSON]5 Ordered to Pay [PERSON]9 Six Figures After Losing [ORGANIZATION] Case173 A federal [STREET] ordered [PERSON] to hand over more than 100,000 to [LOCATION]0 after ruling that the city had violated the gun-rights groups [ORGANIZATION] rights. Federal district [STREET] judge [PERSON] struck down a city ordinance aimed at punishing prospective contractors with ties to the [PERSON]9 as an infringement on the right to free speech and association. On [LOCATION]4, he ordered city officials to pay for the Second Amendment groups attorney fees, which totaled nearly 150,000.174 Leftists Claim [LOCATION]5 Faked His [LOCATION]virus Infection175 After it was announced that President [LOCATION]5 had contracted coronavirus, numerous leftists took to ORG7 to vehemently argue that [LOCATION]5 had staged the infection in order to help his re-election chances. The consensus opinion appears to be that [LOCATION]5 being diagnosed with [PERSON]-19 will harm his campaign because it will stop him traveling for 2 DATE30s and also highlight his supposed hypocrisy over the severity of coronavirus. However, a vocal minority reacted to the news by insisting that the opposite was true, and that [LOCATION]5 staged the whole thing in order to recover quickly from the infection and bolster support for his argument that the threat of [PERSON]-19 has been exaggerated for political reasons.176 [PERSON] [LOCATION]5 [PERSON] Diagnosis177 In news that will come as no surprise to anyone, but needs to be highlighted, leftists everywhere are hyperventilating and celebrating at President [LOCATION]5s announcement that he and the First Lady have tested positive for Covid-19. [LOCATION]5 broke the news late DATE31.178 [PERSON]6 Police, [ORGANIZATION] Was Attacked179 [PERSON]6 police announced DATE35 they have not been able to corroborate allegations made by a biracial [PERSON]7 woman that she was burned by four white men in [LOCATION] [PERSON]6 in [LOCATION] in what was initially reported as a hate crime and garnered national and international attention. PERSON54, [LOCATION], told police someone sprayed lighter fluid on her and set her on fire in the early morning [TIME] of [LOCATION] [DATE] after one of the men yelled a racial epithet. But on DATE35, the [INSTITUTION] said it was closing the case because after an exhaustive probe, detectives were unable to corroborate or locate evidence consistent with what was reported.[LOCATION]0 Medical Journal Calls for Mandatory [PERSON] Vaccine Noncompliance Should Incur a Penalty[LOCATION]1 A paper published in [LOCATION]1 has called for mandating a coronavirus vaccine, and outlined strategies for how GPE6ns could be FORCED to take it. The paper warns that an immediate mandate for the vaccine would spark too much resistance and backlash, so the writers suggest that at first it should be voluntary. However, it suggests that if not enough people are willing to get the vaccine within [DATE] of its availability, it should be transformed into an obligation, with penalties put into [STREET] for refusal.[LOCATION]2 PERSON55 [PERSON] [LOCATION]5 Could be Lying About Having [PERSON] to [ORGANIZATION] the Election[LOCATION]3 Film maker PERSON55 says that [LOCATION]5 is an evil genius who could be lying about being infected with coronavirus in order to justify postponing the election. In a lengthy Facebook post, PERSON56 outlines why he thinks [PERSON]2 could be deliberately misleading the GPE6n public in announcing that [LOCATION]5 and the First Lady were diagnosed with [PERSON]-19. After claiming that [LOCATION]5 has lied roughly 25,000 times in [LOCATION], PERSON56 asks, Why on earth would we believe him [PERSON]? Has he earned your trust now? No Why would [LOCATION]5 all of a sudden just start telling the truth?[LOCATION]4 [PERSON]8 Police Rescue 25 Missing Children in Sweep[LOCATION]5 [PERSON]8 [PERSON]06 Police announced on [ORGANIZATION]0 that it had located 25 missing children from across the [ORGANIZATION] area, including [PERSON]9, GPE40, and GPE41 counties. In Operation MISafeKid II, police cross-referenced photos, last known locations, and other identifying information to locate the children, many of whom were at risk for sex trafficking.[LOCATION]6 MS[PERSON]9s PERSON57 [LOCATION]5 [PERSON] Fascism[LOCATION]7 MS[PERSON]9 contributor [PERSON] on DATE31 sounded off on his concerns for the [DATE]9 presidential election. PERSON57 advised during Morning Joe that President [PERSON]s supporters, who he referred to as the people who like fascism, should not be the focus of the media. Comment Another communist talking head.[LOCATION]8 [ORGANIZATION] Finals Ratings Hit Record Low for [LOCATION]4-[LOCATION]5 Game 1[LOCATION]9 One of the most iconic franchises with one of the leagues all-time great players may be playing in the [ORGANIZATION] Finals, but it still wasnt enough for the series opener to avoid the recent trend of rough sports television ratings. [ORGANIZATION]0s Game 1 between the [LOCATION]4 and [LOCATION]5 averaged a 4.1 rating and 7.41 million viewers, making it the least-watched [ORGANIZATION] Finals game since at least [DATE]8, according to [LOCATION]6. The previous lows of 5.2 and 8.06 million came in [ORGANIZATION]3 for Game 2 between the [LOCATION]7 and Spurs.190 New [PERSON] Law Requires Corporate Boards to Meet Minority Quotas191 [PERSON] Gov. [PERSON] has signed the first bill in the country that requires all corporate boards to possess at least one director from an underrepresented community. The requirement will take effect by [ORGANIZATION]4 [PERSON]4 Admits [LOCATION]8 Decision Not to Close Borders at Start of Pandemic Was Based on Politics,  Not Science193 [ORGANIZATION] has published an article admitting what we told you 8 [LOCATION]6 ago  that the [ORGANIZATION]0 directive at the start of the coronavirus pandemic that countries shouldnt close their borders was a decision based on politics, not science. [ORGANIZATION]1 has long encouraged mass tourism and said closing borders wouldnt stop the spread of Covid-19. A [ORGANIZATION] investigation found this policy was never based on science, but instead on politics and economics, tweeted the [PERSON]4 with a link to an article detailing the issue.194 [ORGANIZATION]9 Union Bosses Struggling to Convince Members to Vote Against [PERSON]195 Union bosses in the swing state of [ORGANIZATION]9 admit they are struggling to convince their rank-and-file members to vote against President [PERSON] in the upcoming presidential election. As Democrat presidential candidate [LOCATION]2 visited [ORGANIZATION]9 this DATE30, local reports indicate union bosses are having a difficult time convincing their members to vote against [LOCATION]5 [ORGANIZATION]7. [ORGANIZATION] infiltrate unions and, while pretending to fight hard for members, seek to get in a position to run unions.196 GPE15 on Course to Have Most Deadly Spate of Violence in [ORGANIZATION]8 Four fatal shootings in GPE15 this DATE30 bring the total for [ORGANIZATION]9 to 39 homicides  putting the city on a trajectory to have its most deadly spate of violence in [PERSON]0 and prompting an outcry from community leaders who work directly with victims and families affected by the gunfire. So far [PERSON]1, 173 people have been struck by gunfire in 595 shootings, up from 89 people struck in 300 shootings at this time [PERSON]2. The numbers include those killed by gunshots, police said.198 [ORGANIZATION]3 Founder Announces Hes Suing [LOCATION]4, [PERSON]2 and Reporters Who Call Multiracial Patriotic Group White Supremacists and Nazis199 [ORGANIZATION]3 founder [PERSON]1 has announced that he is suing [LOCATION]2, [PERSON]2 and all of these reporters who call this multiracial patriotic group white supremacists and Nazis. Despite the fact that the current [ORGANIZATION]3 Chairman [PERSON]2 is Cuban and African GPE6n, [LOCATION]4 and his media lackeys have been smearing the group as white supremacists since President [PERSON] walloped him in the debate on [LOCATION]4.200 [ORGANIZATION]4 Professor [PERSON] Articles for Chinese Propaganda Outlet201 A professor at a public, taxpayer-funded university in [PERSON]8 regularly writes articles for a Chinese propaganda outlet working to delegitimize [LOCATION]. [ORGANIZATION]5 [ORGANIZATION]6 professor [PERSON]3 has written multiple articles for [ORGANIZATION]7 [ORGANIZATION]8, which is owned and operated by the Chinese government. According to detailed reports from the [ORGANIZATION]9, GPE43 has purchased several media outlets to tell ORG60 story well as part of a larger worldwide propaganda campaign. [ORGANIZATION]8 is one of them. It pushes an anti-capitalist, anti-GPE6n narrative that many experts believe advances [ORGANIZATION] global influence.202 Rising Star Cyclist Suspended by GPE44 Team for One Word Pro-[LOCATION]5 Tweet203 Cyclists tweet showed mere indirect support to President [LOCATION]5.204 [PERSON] FAC0 Riddled With Crime, Drugs and Homelessness205 GPE45  [PERSON] oldest park is in peril. Crime, drugs and homelessness have taken over FAC0. If you came here [PERSON]3 on beautiful day like this youd see kids playing, you would see young women and men, they would be out here having lunch on the playground, listening to music, playing games, said [PERSON]4 who is a former pastor and the founder and chair of The Friends of FAC0.206 Senator [PERSON]5 Tests Positive for [LOCATION]virus207 Senator [PERSON]5 [ORGANIZATION] announced on DATE35 that he has tested positive for coronavirus. The news came after President [LOCATION]5 revealed that he and First Lady [LOCATION]3 [LOCATION]5 have contracted the virus, along with [ORGANIZATION] aide [PERSON]7 and ORG63 chairwoman [PERSON]8. [PERSON]9 has made multiple appearances on ORG64 and at [PERSON]2 in [PERSON]4, although it is not apparent that his case is connected to the presidents.208 ORG65 [PERSON] PERSON70 Emergency Powers209 GPE47  In a landmark ruling with far-reaching implications, the [PERSON]8 Supreme [STREET] decided DATE35 that Gov. PERSON71 violated her constitutional authority by continuing to issue orders to combat [PERSON]-19 without the approval of state lawmakers. The [STREET], in its 71-page ruling, found that PERSON72 did not have authority after [PERSON]5 to issue or renew any executive orders related to the pandemic under the [PERSON]6 Emergency Management Act. The justices also found PERSON72 did not possess the authority to exercise emergency powers under the [PERSON]7 Emergency Powers of the Governor Act because the act violates the [PERSON]8 Constitution.210 [PERSON] Tells [PERSON]2 [LOCATION]5 Broke You Guys211 During an appearance on PERSON75 PERSON45s show, Senator [PERSON] lambasted [PERSON]2 for being obsessed with hating President [LOCATION]5, telling the host, [PERSON] broke you guys. Speaking about the fallout from [LOCATION]4 [TIME] debate, the GPE48 Senator said GPE6ns were sick of the medias wall to wall fixation with bashing the commander in chief. PERSON75, there was a time when [PERSON]2 actually cared about being journalistic and talking about facts  [PERSON] broke you guys, said Cruz.212 The Coming Break Up of GPE6, Part [DATE] PERSON76, author of, CIVIL WAR II THE COMING BREAKUP OF GPE7, brings concrete historical evidence to the impending conflicts in GPE6. By looking around, you, the average GPE6n, can see this tragedy building. If youre not living in [PERSON], GPE49, [ORGANIZATION]2, GPE48, [PERSON]0, [ORGANIZATION]7, [PERSON]1, [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]2, [PERSON]8 and [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]3-you might not see it-but its coming and its coming fast. PERSON77 states, [STREET] gangs will doubtless form the core of future black and Hispanic urban militiasconsider the followingthey are well financed by drug tradethey are ethnically orientedare heavily armedorganized and disciplinedand numerous beyond belief. That statement is born out by latest statistics whereby 29 percent of our state and federal prisons are filled with legal and illegal immigrants. PERSON77 states, Their leadership is composed of courageous, industrious and intelligent men because promotion is based on leadership, business acumen and application of ruthless violence. When you look at the massive 120 billion [PERSON]8 drug trade infecting this country, its evident. These urban gangs are evolving into serious armies, armies hostile to the established government. Its why 800,000 [PERSON]ns fled their state [PERSON]9. In [PERSON]0, GPE6n citizens fled north. [PERSON]2 is fast becoming Arabic exclusively. [PERSON]4, [PERSON] known as [PERSON]5 tips toward an exclusive [LOCATION] in population. [PERSON] is no longer an GPE6n city. As their numbers grow, police cant touch them because of Special Order 40 which gives them immunity from arrest and deportation. Such Governors as in [PERSON]6 and GPE49s Governor directly break immigration laws by passing ordinances encouraging more illegal aliens and giving them sanctuary. The governor of [PERSON]7 openly encourages massive illegal alien importation. Hes pushed by meatpacking plant owners who openly hire illegal aliens. [PERSON]8, [PERSON]7 suffers from over 3,000 illegal aliens working in the meatpacking plants. Citizens are left without jobs while a few people make millions at the top.214 Threat of Critical Race Theory215 President [LOCATION]5 recently issued an executive order prohibiting federal agencies from using critical race theory as part of their personnel-training programs. The president acted in response to my reporting exposing the use of diversity, equity, and inclusion training courses in federal agencies. These programs, based on a neo-Marxist ideology that originated in law schools [ORGANIZATION]0, purport to expose and correct unconscious racial bias and white privilege among their employees. Critical race theory treats whiteness as a moral blight and maligns all members of that racial group as complicit in oppression. Critical race theory now forms the basis of personnel-training programs around the country, from corporate GPE6 and universities to churches and nonprofits. One can trace a direct line from the critical race theory trainings in government, education, and universities to the recent violence and destruction in the streets of so many GPE6n cities. Many committed to the cultural Marxist narrative are now entrenched in vital GPE6n institutions. The recent riots have exposed the extent to which leaders in ORG67 have embraced the ideology of the woke Left. With such widespread penetration of that ideology, the crisis is unlikely to fade away. The riots of the last three [LOCATION]6 could open the door to a radical transformation of our constitutional system, including an end to colorblind application of the rule of law-especially if the political coalition that has permitted, and even encouraged, violent protesters regains power at the national level. If leftists merely accuse others of racism, without these accusations being subject to scrutiny from conservative political leaders, they will retain their political momentum-and millions of GPE6ns will continue to face the threat of accusation and cancellation. Whether it comes to racism or any other sin, few GPE6ns believe that all members of any group are inherently innocent while all those of another are inherently guilty. Adherents of critical race theory do believe this, though-and theyre aggressively teaching it. Our leaders must expose critical race theory as the destructive ideology that it is.216 Top [LOCATION]5 Aide [PERSON]7 Tests Positive for [PERSON]-19 After Traveling With the President [LOCATION]4 and [ORGANIZATION]0217 Update President [LOCATION]5 tweeted that he and the first lady will quarantine until they get their test results back [PERSON]7, one of President [LOCATION]5s closest aides, has tested positive for [PERSON]-19 after traveling with the president aboard [ORGANIZATION] to the presidential debate on [LOCATION]4 as well as the [LOCATION]5 rally in [PERSON]7 on [ORGANIZATION]0.2[LOCATION] [LOCATION]5 [ORGANIZATION] for [LOCATION]virus Could Actually Help His Chances of Re-Election219 Despite the media consensus that President [LOCATION]5 testing positive for coronavirus is a huge negative for his presidential campaign, data shows it could actually help him. Leftists reacted to the news that [LOCATION]5 and the First Lady had contracted [PERSON]-19 with a mixture of gloating and glee, suggesting it was payback for the president not taking the virus seriously enough while also partly derailing his re-election campaign. However, if what happened after two other populist world leaders were infected with [PERSON] repeats for a third time, it could actually boost [LOCATION]5s poll numbers.220 [LOCATION]5 to [LOCATION]4 on [PERSON]0 Ideas Dont [PERSON] Buildings221 During a Campaign rally in [PERSON]9, [PERSON]7 [ORGANIZATION]0, President [LOCATION]5 mocked [LOCATION]2s declaration during the Presidential debate that [PERSON]0 is just an idea. [LOCATION]2 says [PERSON]0 is just an idea, [LOCATION]5 announced, adding Well, ideas dont assault cops and they dont burn down buildings. [PERSON]0 is a domestic terrorist organization.222 GPE60 Plans Massive [PERSON] Testing amp38 [PERSON] Regime223 Operation Moonshot is the name of the GPE60 governments newly proposed [PERSON]-19 mass testing scheme. The plan, revealed by [ORGANIZATION] involves an expansion of testing from the current hundreds of thousands of tests [DATE] to 10 million a day by [ORGANIZATION]3. But how does the government propose to do this? How will testing increase between now and [ORGANIZATION]3? The documents show a proposed three-stage rollout. They state that the GPE60 will carry out between 200,000 to 800,000 tests a day between [LOCATION] and [ORGANIZATION]6 [DATE]9. This might break down to 200,000 tests a day on people with symptoms, 100,000 a day on people without symptoms in local areas to suppress outbreaks, 250,000 a day on people without symptoms in the [ORGANIZATION] and care homes, and 100,000 a day through national prevalence studies. From [ORGANIZATION]6 the plans propose increasing [ORGANIZATION]7 capacity to between two and four million. This would involve mass testing of all homes in local areas or whole cities when prevalence rises 430,000 tests a day, testing high contact professions such as teachers every DATE30 100,000 a day, and testing people to allow them to enter high risk settings, such as visitors to the hospital and care homes. The plan then states that there would be full rollout in [ORGANIZATION]3 to 10 million tests a day, to enable people to return to and maintain a normal life. At this stage, DATE30ly testing would be made available progressively to the whole population to allow people to go to high-risk events by using a digital passport to show they have tested negative for the virus. Comment There is no test for [PERSON]-19, the test only shows that you may have had one of the family of corona virus in the past  so, a common cold would give a positive reading. Authorities know this  they are ramping up testing to generate massive numbers of positives which are really just false positives. This provides the pretext for Orwells boot stamping on the face forever.2[DATE] [ORGANIZATION]-C Was Supposed to [ORGANIZATION]. Instead, Its a Total Mess.225 A mix of hidden standards make the ubiquitous cable a pain to deal with [ORGANIZATION] hailed [ORGANIZATION]-C as the future of cables when it hit the mainstream market with ORG70 single-[INSTITUTION] [LOCATION] in [ORGANIZATION]9. It was a huge improvement over the previous generation of [ORGANIZATION], allowing for many different types of functionality  charging, connecting to an external display, etc.  in one simple cord, all without having a right side up like its predecessor. [ORGANIZATION]0, [ORGANIZATION]-C is near-ubiquitous Almost every modern laptop and smartphone has at least one [ORGANIZATION]-C [INSTITUTION], with the exception of the [ORGANIZATION], which still uses ORG70 proprietary Lightning [INSTITUTION]. For all its improvements, [ORGANIZATION]-C has become a mess of tangled standards  a nightmare for consumers to navigate despite the initial promise of simplicity. Anyone going all-in on [ORGANIZATION]-C will run into problems with an optional standard called Power Delivery. The standard allows devices to charge at a much higher wattage relative to older connectors, therefore allowing them to charge faster. But it requires the right combination of charger, cables, and device to actually achieve this.226 Video Democratic Ad Compares [DATE]9 GPE6 to Nazi [PERSON]227 [ORGANIZATION] is facing backlash after it produced a campaign ad that compared GPE6 under President [LOCATION]5 to Nazi [PERSON] under PERSON79. The video, titled [ORGANIZATION] doesnt stop itself, it must be stopped, features a split screen with footage of [LOCATION]5 rallies, and by its side footage of nazi rallies from [ORGANIZATION]1. For good measure, the Democrats threw in images of white supremacists from GPE61 in [ORGANIZATION]2, as well as images from the 20[LOCATION] GPE62 synagogue attack.228 [ORGANIZATION] Tweets Imagine What it Will be Like Never to Have to Think About [LOCATION]5 Again After [LOCATION]virus Announcement229 Despite being apparently unconnected to [LOCATION]5s announcement that he had contracted coronavirus, the [ORGANIZATION] was forced to delete a tweet that stated, [ORGANIZATION] what it will be like to never have to think about [LOCATION]5 again. [LOCATION]5 tweeted that he and [LOCATION]3 had tested positive for [PERSON]-19 [TIME], prompting a wave of gloating and celebration from leftists and the media. [TIME], the [ORGANIZATION] tweeted a link to the story, with many believing it to be a reaction to the news.230 [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] for Man Who Pointed Gun at Police231 ORG75 ORG74 activists chastised hotel guests in downtown GPE15 on [ORGANIZATION]0 night for closing their blinds during a vigil for a black man who was shot by police [PERSON]3  A grand jury determined that the officers involved in the fatal incident were justified in their use of deadly force. It is incredibly disrespectful for all of you to be up here. And you are so privileged. There is a memorial for a man who was killed and you think its more important to watch TV, a protester said. That is their priority. So get your priorities straight. This isnt a joke.232 Woman Charged With Using Minors to Steal [LOCATION]5, PERSON80 Campaign Signs233 [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION] say they have arrested a GPE65 woman, accused of using minors to steal campaign signs.

If you ever have a child, I sincerely hope it is a girl, and I hope you go through what I went through. I wish it on you, the mother of the [ORGANIZATION]6 girl said to two of the three suspected gang rapists of her daughter during a trial in GPE68 [STREET]. The defense responded the rape as a youthful sin in response.236 PERSON82, The PMs Dad, And a Scottish Separatist [ORGANIZATION]8 of High-Profile [PERSON] Rule Breaking237 PERSON83 MP has admitted to travelling back and forth from GPE69 to GPE70 despite awaiting a coronavirus diagnosis that later proved positive. PERSON84, a member of the leftist, separatist ORG77 [ORGANIZATION], had said she had taken a [PERSON]-19 test on [ORGANIZATION]9 after experiencing mild symptoms, but made the journey south on [LOCATION]0 because she said she was feeling much better. Potentially risking infection to other MPs in ORG79, she then entered the chamber and used her time to praise the [ORGANIZATION] for its handling of the pandemic, according to the [ORGANIZATION]0. It was after her appearance in [ORGANIZATION] that evening she received the news she had coronavirus. Rather than self-isolating at her GPE70 home as legally mandated, she took the train back to GPE69 on [LOCATION]4 morning, failing to inform the Speaker of [ORGANIZATION] until [ORGANIZATION]0 afternoon. The MP apologised for her actions, and the [ORGANIZATION] GPE71 leader PERSON[DATE] announced on DATE31 that he would be suspending the whip for PERSON84, effectively suspending her from the party. On DATE35, party leader PERSON86 called for PERSON84 to do the right thing and resign as MP.238 GPE72 to Reintroduce a [PERSON]06 of Emergency on [LOCATION]0239 On [LOCATION]0, Oct. 5, GPE73 will declare a state of emergency once again after the government approved the proposal of the Minister of [PERSON]03 PERSON87, who suggested to make this move to stop the rapid spread of coronavirus. The state of emergency will last for [LOCATION]3. According to PERSON88, without declaring the state of emergency, the number of patients with [PERSON] could strain the capacity of medical facilities by [LOCATION]4 [ORGANIZATION]1 Launches Legal Action Against GPE60 for Breaching Divorce Agreement[DATE]1 [LOCATION]an Commission President PERSON89 announced on DATE31 that the [LOCATION]an Union was launching legal proceedings against [PERSON] for passing legislation that overrides part of the [PERSON] withdrawal agreement WA. On [ORGANIZATION]0, [ORGANIZATION] passed the Internal Market Bill, which allows for the British parliament to overturn parts of the WA. Prime Minister PERSON90 put forward the bill because he said that the [ORGANIZATION]1 had not been negotiating in good faith and wanted a legal mechanism to protect the movement of goods within the nation in the event of a no-deal.[DATE]2 French Butcher Attacked With Tear Gas by Children for Selling Pork[DATE]3 Children DATE[DATE] attacked a butcher in the French city of GPE76, allegedly over the shop selling pork products.

Its a scam. A swindle. Its high time we understood that were in the midst of a global crime. This large group of medical experts publishes a medical newspaper on 500,000 copies every DATE30, to inform the public about the massive misinformation in the mainstream media. They also organize mass protests in [LOCATION], like the one on [DATE] 29, [DATE]9 where 12 million people signed up and several millions actually showed up. Why do these 500 medical doctors say the pandemic is a global crime? What do they know, that we dont?[DATE]8 Most Czechs Would Refuse [PERSON]-19 Vaccine, Do Not Trust [ORGANIZATION] in General[DATE]9 Most Czechs would refuse to be vaccinated against [PERSON]-19 when the vaccine is available, according to the survey by [ORGANIZATION]8 agency, with respondents mostly explaining their reluctance by saying that they generally did not trust any vaccination. According to the respondents, the [PERSON]-19 vaccine in preparation is also not sufficiently tested. [ORGANIZATION] against a new type of coronavirus are currently being developed and tested in several countries, including GPE73. [PERSON]n researchers have also introduced the first officially completed vaccine named [PERSON]. So far, GPE72 has a prototype of its own vaccine, which will now be assessed by experts from the Czech Vaccinological Society. However, almost three-fifths of Czechs said in the current survey that they did not want to be vaccinated against coronavirus.250 PERSON95 Demands Resignation of [ORGANIZATION]1 Commission VP PERSON96 [PERSON] suspending all bilateral contacts with her PERSON5, 29 SET  [PERSON]s Prime Minister [PERSON] requested the immediate resignation of [LOCATION]an Commission Vice President PERSON98 in a letter to ORG90 President PERSON89, PERSON95s [ORGANIZATION] informed [PERSON]. [PERSON] is at the same time suspending all bilateral political contacts with her. According to PERSON95, PERSON99 recent statements are incompatible with her current mandate. In the letter, PERSON95 claimed that [LOCATION]00 said that in [PERSON] a sick democracy is being built, a political attack against the democratically elected Government of [PERSON] and a humiliation to [PERSON] and the Hungarian people. Moreover, PERSON95 recalled that the ORG92 role is neutral and PERSON99 wording are a blatant violation of the principle of sincere cooperation.252 GPE80 Hears Echoes of Nazi Rhetoric After German Politician Urges [ORGANIZATION]1 to [ORGANIZATION] GPE80 and [PERSON]253 Deputy Head of the [LOCATION]an ORG79, [LOCATION]01, has caused massive outrage due to her appeal to starve GPE80 and [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION]1 funds. According to the website of ORG94, [LOCATION]02 called for increased pressure against GPE80 and [PERSON] to maintain so-called rule of law in those countries. The rule of law is constantly broken and [ORGANIZATION]1 funds are an efficient [STREET] to exact pressure. [PERSON]06s such as GPE80 and [PERSON] must be financially starved. Funds are an efficient lever, she told German radio. Several Polish politicians and commentators criticized [LOCATION]02, emphasizing the historic connotation of using the word starvation in context of Polish-German relations, according to Polish media outlet ORG95 GPE69 [PERSON] Police Crash [ORGANIZATION]0 Girls Birthday Party After Neighbors Snitch on Family255 Police in GPE69 turned up at a [ORGANIZATION]1 girls birthday party after a neighbor snitched on her family for not following coronavirus social distancing rules.256 Swedish Expert Tells Govt to Crack Down Even Harder on [ORGANIZATION] Speech and Misinformation257 Swedish government investigator Carl [LOCATION]5h has recommended the state crack down even harder on so-called hate speech online, as well as disinformation and propaganda. According to Mr [LOCATION]5h, a researcher at [ORGANIZATION], propaganda and hate speech are a threat to the countrys democracy.258 [ORGANIZATION] Under-Reported During GPE60 Lockdown259 As a result of the [PERSON]-19 shutdown ordered by governments, adolescents and children are being physically abused in record numbers, with incidences involving children in [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] at their highest levels since [ORGANIZATION]2, according to a recent report by the [PERSON]. Even the prestigious ORG98 medical journal is finally admitting that the governments own lockdown measures have driven increases in mortality resulting  due to movement restrictions imposed during the supposed pandemic.260 The German Left and Rights Shared Affinity for [PERSON]261 by [LOCATION]05 Similarities between [PERSON]s left and the right-wing ORG99 may seem hard to find, however when it comes to [PERSON] and President [LOCATION]06, both appear to possess shared ideas and sentiments. Are the ORG99 and [ORGANIZATION]? [PERSON]s right-wing party Alternative für [LOCATION] ORG99 and [PERSON]01 are easy to distinguish in [ORGANIZATION]7 politics. Both sides make sure of it by slandering one another on an almost [ORGANIZATION]7 basis by calling each other Nazis and Communists. And those are just the friendlier exchanges. The recent assassination attempt on [LOCATION]07, however, once again displayed how the contours of German politics are blurred when [PERSON] is involved. The latest example of this was provided by the ORG99s foreign policy spokesman [LOCATION]08. Asked about the [LOCATION]09 case and [PERSON]s involvement he stated that the GPE44 could have committed the crime because of [ORGANIZATION]. 262 GPE60 Softens Negotiating Stance, Offers [ORGANIZATION]1 [ORGANIZATION]4 Fishing Transition Period Report263 GPE83 has reportedly softened its position on one of its [PERSON] red lines, by offering the [LOCATION]an Union a [ORGANIZATION]5 transition period for [LOCATION]an fishermen to access British fishing waters. [ORGANIZATION]s negotiators are said to have offered [LOCATION]an fleets a phase down from [ORGANIZATION]6, rather than the GPE60 taking back full control of fishing waters at the end of the transition period on [ORGANIZATION]6 31st, [DATE]9.264 GPE60 [LOCATION]10 [PERSON] Bomber Associated With Known Extremists, Was on Security Services Radar [LOCATION] Times265 [LOCATION]11, the jihadist who killed 22 people at an [LOCATION]10 concert in GPE84, GPE[DATE] in [ORGANIZATION]2 repeatedly came to the attention of the security services but officers failed to connect the dots, leaving him free to murder. The Libyan-origin [ORGANIZATION]8 detonated a rucksack full of improvised explosives at the GPE84 Arena on [DATE] [ORGANIZATION]2, killing 22 at an [LOCATION]10 concert. Most of the victims were child fans of the pop star, and their parents who had chaperoned them.266 GPE60 Conservative MP Slams Nanny [PERSON]06 Socialist Response to [LOCATION]virus267 Conservative MP [LOCATION]12 has criticised the governments nanny state socialist coronavirus response, after [ORGANIZATION] had voted to extend the emergency powers which gives the prime minister autonomy to pass legislation without requiring parliamentary scrutiny. Addressing [PERSON]03 Secretary [LOCATION]13 in [ORGANIZATION] on DATE31, Mr [LOCATION]14 criticised the arbitrary [TIME] curfew on pubs, restaurants, and other social venues which he said is destroying [ORGANIZATION]s hospitality industry and thereby putting [PERSON] out of work.268 GPE60 [PERSON]-1984 Wedding Venue Shut Down, Fined 10,000 for Having Too Many Guests269 A wedding venue in [LOCATION] has been forced to shut down and its manager was fined 10,000 for hosting a wedding reception that reportedly had too many people attend, contravening the restrictions on public gatherings decreed by Prime Minister PERSON90.

Police said that it will remain closed until [ORGANIZATION] are satisfied that it can, and will, do so safely.270 GPE60 Furious [ORGANIZATION]6 Owner Blocks [STREET] to Stop Council Tow Truck Taking His Sports Car Over Unpaid Parking Ticket  and Wins!271 Outraged [LOCATION]15 saw his car being loaded on a tow-truck hour after ticket. He obstructed the lorry by sitting in the [STREET] in GPE87 as he worked on laptop. His wife [LOCATION]16 stood behind the tow-truck so it couldnt reverse and escape.272 GPE60 The [ORGANIZATION] Needs to Stop Being Hysterical. Taking Steps to Shield the Vulnerable Elderly From [PERSON] is Not Age-Based Apartheid273 There are practical ways to protect the vulnerable elderly without going as far as age-based apartheid. For example, special efforts have been made to ensure older people can get shopping delivered rather than having to go out themselves. Older people themselves are now much more aware of the risks than before, but at least have choices now about how much risk they are willing to accept. Those choices should not be taken away from them. That seems to be the opposite of current government policy  to impose sweeping restrictions on everyone and isolate the most vulnerable, whatever their personal wishes. So area after area of the GPE60 is now under specific local restrictions. GPE69 now bans members of one household entering another home. In the north-east of [ORGANIZATION], the rules will go even further this DATE30, banning households from meeting each other in any enclosed space and strongly advising against mixing outdoors. Its getting to the point where talk of local lockdowns is becoming meaningless, since so many areas now face restrictions that they are, in effect, national restrictions. There seems to be a misguided sense of fairness going on. Rather than be seen to discriminate against older people  which is what the virus itself does  the medical establishment seems to want to make everyone suffer equally. So we end up with the farce of university students being forcibly confined to their halls of residence and told not to go home to their families, despite the fact that the illness poses little risk of serious illness to them.274 GPE60 Watch [LOCATION]17 and [LOCATION]18 [PERSON] to GPE70 Newspaper on Race Awakening, [LOCATION]01 GPE88 [ORGANIZATION]  [LOCATION]17 has spoken about his awakening to race issues as he and his wife, [LOCATION]18, launched an anti-racism campaign to mark [LOCATION]02 in the GPE89 In a video interview with the [PERSON]04 newspaper published DATE31, [LOCATION]19 said GPE70 sometimes doesnt feel as diverse as it actually is and that he wanted to use his celebrity to raise awareness about the Black community and the challenges it faces.276 [PERSON]05 Chief [ORGANIZATION]s Intolerance of the Politically Correct277 GPE90  The [PERSON]05s Secretary of [PERSON]06 decried the intolerance of political correctness [ORGANIZATION]0 as an insidious attack on religious freedom present in many Western democracies.

The list of 40 officials who are responsible for election manipulation and the violent suppression of protests in [LOCATION], was ready in the middle of [LOCATION], however, [LOCATION]22s name is missing from the list. Those sanctions should be imposed on him, especially, as he is the one who is the cause of violence in [LOCATION], [LOCATION]27 said before the meeting of the [ORGANIZATION]1 representatives.282 Report Dozens of [PERSON] Travel to [PERSON] in Defense of GPE95283 The Greek City Times [PERSON]11 reported on DATE31 that roughly 80 volunteers from [LOCATION] are traveling to GPE95 to support the country against GPE96 and GPE97 in the contested GPE98 region. According to [PERSON]11s sources, about 50 of the volunteers are Greek citizens of GPE95n heritage, while the rest are ethnic [PERSON].

Suddenly appearing to become television critics, [ORGANIZATION] on [ORGANIZATION]0 described the debate as full of personal attacks and disruptions which jeopardized the audiences viewing experience.288 Chinese [PERSON]06 Media Gloats About [LOCATION]5 Catching [LOCATION]virus289 The editor-in-chief of Chinese state media outlet [PERSON]14 is gloating about how [LOCATION]5 catching coronavirus could ruin his re-election chances. [PERSON]15 is seen in the west as part of the Chinese governments propaganda apparatus because it is under the umbrella of the Chinese [PERSON]16 newspaper.

There are areas where people feel unsafe, and there are corners in [LOCATION], for example in GPE113 and GPE114, where even police officers only move in groups because they are exposed to attacks, [LOCATION]42 said.

The neighbors of the [LOCATION]52 family on the tree-lined [STREET] are mostly Jewish and Asian upper middle class professionals employed by [LOCATION]une 500 companies and living the GPE6n dream. The [LOCATION]52 home with its soaring gables, its two car garage, and the [ORGANIZATION]6 out front, signaled that they had made it. And with access to good schools, their children would outdo them. [LOCATION]54 [LOCATION]52 probably never will. His guilty plea to one count of concealing attempts to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization puts an end to the case against him, and likely to the future his parents might have planned for him a degree from an Ivy League college, a prestigious profession, and another big house like theirs in a leafy suburb. [LOCATION]19 after [LOCATION]54 graduated from high school, federal investigators were going through the familiar and humiliating process of carting boxes past the loaner [ORGANIZATION]6 and the two car garage. Something had gone very wrong. Like a surprisingly diverse number of GPE6n teens, [LOCATION]54 had decided to convert to [PERSON]36, become an [PERSON]36ic terrorist and kill lots of people. Especially Jews. And possibly anyone in [LOCATION]5 Tower. Including President [LOCATION]53[DATE] GPE60 Considering Floating Asylum Centres in Old Ferries, Sending Migrants to Remote Islands Reports325 The British government is said to be considering off-shore asylum centres on old ferries, or even sending claimants to remote islands in [ORGANIZATION]. The government is reportedly considering turning retired ferries into floating asylum centres off of the British coast to hold would-be refugees until their claims are assessed, according to documents seen by [PERSON]37 GPE60 More Than 9,000 Asylum Seekers Are Now Living in 91 [ORGANIZATION] Amid Record Number of Channel Crossings327 More than 9,000 asylum seekers are living in 91 hotels across the country after [LOCATION]20 for Channel crossings, MPs have been told. [PERSON]38 officials told [PERSON]39 9,500 people have been put up in almost a hundred hotels in around 50 local authority areas. And the departments permanent secretary [LOCATION]55 told the committee There are more people coming into the aylum system at the moment than are leaving it and that is because of Covid.328 [PERSON]40 Insists Record Boat Migrant Numbers Not a Threat To [ORGANIZATION]329 Record numbers of illegal immigrants crossing LOC9 are not a threat to [ORGANIZATION], and could even be a boon for taxpayers, the United Nations [PERSON]40 has claimed. Speaking to [PERSON]42 on [ORGANIZATION]0, representatives from the international body argued that [ORGANIZATION] should open new channels that would allow many more low and no-skilled third world migrants to enter the country legally in order to deter individuals from paying people traffickers.330 Athletics Great [LOCATION]56 Says [PERSON] Shouldnt be Allowed to Compete in Womens Sport as Their Physical Advantages Make Them a Danger to Female Competitors331 [LOCATION]56, who competed in three [ORGANIZATION] and two Olympic games during the [LOCATION]21 and [LOCATION]22, said transgender athletes were a safety risk to female competitors.332 [PERSON]43 Sues Advertising Company for Refusing to Put Up Billboards Claiming Abortion is a Ritual333 The [PERSON]43 is suing an advertising company after it refused to display billboards that said abortion is a ritual. The temple has accused [PERSON]45 of religious discrimination for not putting up eight billboards in [LOCATION] and GPE129 that say abortion is a ritual and that its religious abortion ritual averts many state restrictions.334 [LOCATION]5 Tweets He Will Block [PERSON]46 Decision to Make Seal Ethos Gender-Neutral, Calls it Ridiculous335 President [LOCATION]5 tweeted on DATE31 that he would overturn a [PERSON]46 decision to change the [PERSON]46 SEAL ethos and Special Warface Combatant-Craft Crewman creed to be gender-neutral. The creed and ethos were both recently changed to be gender-neutral, removing words like men and man in favor of warrior and SEALS.336 GPE60 [ORGANIZATION] According to [LOCATION] Guidelines337 New British legislation is being hailed as a breakthrough that discourages teachers from suggesting that children should change their gender based on what they choose to wear or personality traits. The new British guidelines concern interpersonal, sexual and sexual health education in primary and secondary schools, and come at a time when gender transition surgeries are surging in [PERSON]. Transsexuality is only one of the many topics mentioned, but it already suggests a significant change in the approach of the British government to the issue, according to Polish outlet [PERSON]47  1  [DATE]  3 422086  4 422195  [DATE]  6 4[DATE]8  [DATE][DATE]9 4[DATE]0  10 422231  [DATE][DATE][DATE]  14 422[LOCATION]1  15 422171  [DATE] 422209  [LOCATION] 422152  [DATE]  22 422297  23 422[LOCATION]7  [DATE] [DATE]  [DATE]  26 422191  27 4[DATE]2  [DATE]  [DATE][DATE] 422159  [DATE]  39 42[DATE]  40 422233  41 422[LOCATION]3  [DATE][DATE]  46 4221[DATE]  [DATE]  [DATE]  50 422179  51 4221[LOCATION]  52 422110  53 422223  [DATE]  55 422[LOCATION]9  56 4[DATE]6  57 422114  [DATE]  [DATE]  [DATE] 422239  [DATE]  64 422[DATE]3  65 422269  66 422261  67 422088  68 422108  69 422[DATE]9  [DATE]  71 422[DATE]1  72 422102  73 422253  [DATE]75 422089  [DATE][DATE][DATE][DATE][DATE]  [DATE][DATE]84 422128  [DATE] 422235  [DATE]  [DATE]88 422[LOCATION]5  89 422167  [DATE]95 422289  96 422237  97 422293  98 422257  99 422251  100 422[DATE]5  101 422287  102 422259  103 422126  104 422255  105 422295  106 4220[DATE]  [DATE]  108 422291  109 4222[DATE]  110 422095  111 422217  112 [DATE]  113 422[DATE]7  114  115 topheadline  116  117 topheadline  1[LOCATION]  119 topheadline  120  121 topheadline  122  123 topheadline  1[DATE]  125 topheadline  126  127 topheadline  128  129 topheadline  130  131 topheadline  132  133 topheadline  134 rzerohedgefeed391-D7EVrCBocalifornia-gov-newsom-changes-reopening-rules-again-adds-racial-equity-measures  135 topheadline  136  137  138 topheadline  139  140 topheadline  141  142 topheadline  143  144 topheadline  145  146 topheadline  147  148 topheadline  149  150 topheadline  151  152 topheadline  153  154 topheadline  155  156 topheadline  157  158 topheadline  159  160 topheadline  161  162 topheadline  163  164 topheadline  165  166 topheadline  167  168 topheadline  169  170 topheadline  171  172 topheadline  173  174 topheadline  175  176 topheadline  177  178 topheadline  179  [LOCATION]0 topheadline  [LOCATION]1  [LOCATION]2 topheadline  [LOCATION]3  [LOCATION]4 topheadline  [LOCATION]5  [LOCATION]6 topheadline  [LOCATION]7  [LOCATION]8 topheadline  [LOCATION]9  190 topheadline  191  192 topheadline  193  194 topheadline  195  196 topheadline  197  198 topheadline  199  200 topheadline  201  202 topheadline  203  204 topheadline  205  206 topheadline  207  208 topheadline  209  210 topheadline  211  212 topheadline  213  214 topheadline  215  216 topheadline  217  2[LOCATION] topheadline  219  220 topheadline  221  222 topheadline  223  2[DATE] topheadline  225  226 topheadline  227  228 topheadline  229  230 topheadline  231  232 topheadline  233  234 topheadline  235  236 topheadline  237  238 topheadline  239  [DATE]0 topheadline  [DATE]1  [DATE]2 topheadline  [DATE]3  [DATE]4 topheadline  [DATE]5  [DATE]6 topheadline  [DATE]7  [DATE]8 topheadline  [DATE]9  250 topheadline  251  252 topheadline  253  254 topheadline  255 rblacklistednewshKxa3A3scfuQi3Z8covid-police-crash-10yearold-girls-birthday-party-after-neighbors-snitch-on.html  256 topheadline  257  258 topheadline  259 rblacklistednewshKxa3S1C8KumQxJsthe-hidden-epidemic-childabuse-underreported-during-uk.html  260 topheadline  261  262 topheadline  263  264 topheadline  265  266 topheadline  267  268 topheadline  269  270 topheadline  271  272 topheadline  273  274 topheadline  275  276 topheadline  277  278 topheadline  279  280 topheadline  281  282 topheadline  283  284 topheadline  2[DATE]  286 topheadline  287  288 topheadline  289  290 topheadline  291  292 topheadline  293  294 topheadline  295  296 topheadline  297  298 topheadline  299  300 topheadline  301  302 topheadline  303  304 topheadline  305  306 topheadline  307  308 topheadline  309  310 topheadline  311  312 topheadline  313  314 topheadline  315  316 topheadline  317  3[LOCATION] topheadline  319  320 topheadline  321  322 topheadline  323  3[DATE] topheadline  325  326 topheadline  327  328 topheadline  329  330 topheadline  331  332 topheadline  333  334 topheadline  335  336 topheadline  337  338 topheadline"

PERSON1 underlined that [ORGANIZATION] is leaving each crisis stronger, without losses or with barely any and as a result, each time we are lessening the gap towards the damaged leaders. We are overtaking more and more countries which are falling into disarray, such as [PERSON], GPE2 and soon [PERSON].

[ORGANIZATION] A group of parents and teachers in GPE4, [PERSON], are working to compile a list of parents in the county who are suspected of disagreeing with the school district adding [ORGANIZATION] to its curriculum. The 624-member private ORG23 group called [ORGANIZATION] issued a call to members to provide information about parents who they felt disagreed with school curriculum or were neutral on it.87 He Doesnt Know Anything  and Id Say it to His Face  Nobel Prize Winning Inventor of PCR Test Unloads on Dr. [PERSON] in [ORGANIZATION], who won a DATE2 Nobel Prize for inventing the polymerase chain reaction PCR testing procedure that is currently used to diagnose [ORGANIZATION] cases unloaded on Dr. Anthony [PERSON] in a video that went viral over [ORGANIZATION].

The interview was originally recorded back during the AIDS crisis in DATE2 when Dr. [PERSON] was spouting off to the cameras.89 As Left-Wing Anarchism Stalks His City, [LOCATION] Mayor [ORGANIZATION] Warns of White Supremacy90 In responding to the ongoing left-wing violence in his city, [LOCATION] Mayor [ORGANIZATION] raised eyebrows [PERSON] by suggesting white supremacists share blame with the anarchists populating [ORGANIZATION] Police in the [PERSON] state of [LOCATION] have identified four of the eight people who were killed in mass shootings at three massage parlours in the GPE7 area. Officials say it is still too early to know whether the attack, in which six Asian women were killed, was racially motivated. [PERSON]0 Sheriff PERSON6 said the suspect may have been a patron and claimed to have a sex addiction. The attack comes amid a sharp uptick in crimes against Asian-[PERSON]1ns. Four of the victims have been identified as [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] and PERSON10, [PERSON]. PERSON11 was identified as having been injured. In a news conference on [ORGANIZATION], investigators said suspect PERSON[ORGANIZATION]7 admitted to the shooting spree, and said that he denied that the attack was motivated by race. He apparently has an issue, what he considers a sex addiction, and sees these locations as a temptation for him that he wanted to eliminate, said Capt PERSON[ORGANIZATION]8, adding that Mr PERSON14 was caught with a 9mm handgun and did not resist arrest. Massage parlours are known to sometimes provide prostitution services, but authorities say there is no indication yet that this is the case at the targeted locations93 PERSON15 Goes to War Against the [PERSON]1n People as the Globalists Unleash Sinister and [PERSON] in Their War Against Freedom and Liberty94 Offering [PERSON]1 a glimpse of what life might be like in the country by this DATE9, PERSON15 declared that much of [PERSON]1 re-opening depends upon [PERSON]1ns getting vaccinated in huge numbers I need you to get vaccinated when its your turn and you can find an opportunity PERSON15 babbled.

Taking questions at [ORGANIZATION] about whether former President PERSON18 should promote the vaccine to Republican skeptics, PERSON15 argued it was more important what local doctors and preachers say about it.97 [PERSON] GPE[ORGANIZATION]7 AG Says She Wont Investigate PERSON19 Nursing Home Policy, Claims it Would be a Political Attack98 GPE[ORGANIZATION]7 Attorney General [PERSON]0, a fellow Democrat, says she wont investigate Governor PERSON19 nursing home policy despite controversy, claiming to do so would be a political attack. [PERSON]1 said her office cant investigate whether decisions made quickly to contain [ORGANIZATION] constituted bad public policy if other alternatives were available. She said [PERSON] is limited to investigating criminal allegations, but there are none with the nursing home policies.99 ORG7 Discuss Using ORG89-Relief Cash for Bonuses, [ORGANIZATION] to Hawaii100 Throw billions of dollars at school districts in GPE[ORGANIZATION]8, and what do you expect? A group called Reopen GPE[ORGANIZATION]8 Schools got access to online memos from teachers unions in GPE[ORGANIZATION]8 and discovered that in some districts, enriching their members weighs heavier on their priorities than, say, [ORGANIZATION] equipment or programs to help children recover from their prolonged absence from the classrooms. Here is what the teachers union in [PERSON]4, [PERSON]5, a well-to-do suburb east of [PERSON]6 is discussing101 GPE[ORGANIZATION]8 Restaurant Uses Generator to Stay Open After City Cuts Off Power for Violating [ORGANIZATION] Restrictions102 A restaurant in GPE[ORGANIZATION]8 is defying local coronavirus orders by using a generator after a [PERSON]7 judge ruled that the city could cut off power to the restaurant for not following health orders. ORG9 in [PERSON]8, GPE[ORGANIZATION]8, has said it plans to stay open despite coronavirus restrictions.103 [PERSON]2 Says She [PERSON] [PERSON]3 for Defamation104 Conservative personality [PERSON]2 said DATE[ORGANIZATION]7 that she would sue pop star [PERSON]3 over slander involving a photoshopped tweet that the singer was promoting on ORG18. The two individuals have had public ORG18 arguments before, with the most recent spat beginning after [PERSON]4 appeared on the show of ORG10 [PERSON]5 on [PERSON] evening. [PERSON]4 talked about her upcoming talk show through conservative media outlet [ORGANIZATION] and criticized [PERSON]3 for her sexually explicit performance at the DATE[ORGANIZATION]8 Grammy awards.105 FAC0 Investigation Seeks to [PERSON] Dissent106 The governments response to the [LOCATION]4 melee isnt about justice. Its about partisan retribution and revenge. And the consequences will be disastrous. Ginning Up Domestic Terrorism Worrells arrest is the latest in what ORG[ORGANIZATION]7 warned would be an unprecedented investigation leading to sedition charges filed against [PERSON]1n citizens. Attorney General [PERSON]6 pledged to make the FAC0 Breach manhunt his top priority on [LOCATION]5 in office, he received an update on the investigation from ORG[ORGANIZATION]8 Director PERSON[LOCATION]17. [PERSON]8 has compared [LOCATION]4 to the [LOCATION]6 [PERSON]9 bombing that killed 168 people, including 15 children. Roughly 300 people have been arrested so far, many of them transported to GPE20 to await trial and dozens denied bail after federal prosecutors argued the defendants, including a high school senior from [LOCATION], pose a threat to the nation. The FAC0 Breach probe, the departments official title, is a flagrant political prosecution targeting PERSON18 supporters. Every display-from heavy-handed ORG[ORGANIZATION]8 raids to a militarized GPE20-is designed to portray the President PERSON18s allies as domestic terrorists. The differences between how the government is handling the [LOCATION]4 defendants and other so-called protestors could not be more stark. For example, a [LOCATION] investigative reporter found ORG14 has dropped more than one-third of the federal cases related to [LOCATION]7 riots in that city, with more to come. Only about a dozen people have been arrested for [LOCATION]8 rioting in [LOCATION], which included attacks on a federal courthouse.107 PERSON30 [PERSON] Will Exclude [ORGANIZATION] From Its Curriculum108 [PERSON] Gov. PERSON31 announced the [PERSON] curriculum will not include critical race theory. [PERSON] said [PERSON]s civics curriculum will incorporate foundational concepts with the best materials and it will expressly exclude unsanctioned narratives like critical race theory and other unsubstantiated theories. Let me be clear, theres no room in our classrooms for things like critical race theory, teaching kids to hate their country and to hate each other is not worth one red cent of taxpayer money.109 [PERSON] Puts Dr. [PERSON] on Hit List110 Story at-a-glance One of the frontrunners in the comprehensive attack on freedom of speech online is a GPE23 group with opaque funding called ORG16 The ORG17 has been one of the most vocal organizations calling for the deplatforming of anyone who might have the ability to influence public opinion about vaccines The ORG17 recently posted a hit list on ORG18, listing the Top 10 anti-vaxxers it wants digital platforms to eradicate, including yours truly and ORG19 [ORGANIZATION], which worked with ORG21 to establish ORG22 in [LOCATION]9 [DATE], DATE[ORGANIZATION]8, ORG23 complied with [PERSON] request, removing [ORGANIZATION]s account.

However, over DATE22, after mass privacy invasions and censorship practices, it has been losing its dominance in a few important demographics and all social media users in general. Research conducted by ORG[LOCATION]17 revealed some unsurprising facts regarding ORG23. First, ORG23 is no longer the preferred social media platform for people DATE23 millennials and [PERSON] Losing people in this demographic is bad news for ORG23 as this is the demographic preferred by most advertisers. Only 21 of people aged [PERSON] said their preferred social media platform is ORG23.1[ORGANIZATION]8 [PERSON] Off Flight for Not Forcing DATE25 Autistic Son to Wear Mask114 ORG28 kicked a family off a flight home to GPE24, GPE25 because they refused to force their [DATE] autistic son to wear a face mask. ORG29 reports that the family even had a doctors note exempting their son owing to his condition, which is recognised under the [PERSON]1n Disability Act.115 GoFundMe to Pay Off PERSON34 and PERSON35 Mortgage Goes Bust116 A GoFundMe page set up to pay off the mortgage on PERSON34 and PERSON35 14.6 million GPE[ORGANIZATION]8 estate has gone bust  after raising a measly 110, a report says.117 Guns, Knives and Other Weapons Confiscated From Suspects at [LOCATION] ORG30 Riot118 After dozens of [ORGANIZATION] militants smashed up an apartment building in downtown [LOCATION] on DATE[LOCATION]17 night, police made [ORGANIZATION]8 arrests. The masked suspects were found to be carrying guns, knives, crow bars, hammers and other weapons. At [TIME], officers from the [LOCATION] Police Bureau rushed after the ORG30 rioting in [LOCATION]s wealthy LOC2 and created a manned perimeter. So-called legal observers, reporters, and anyone with medical conditions were given the opportunity to leave the enclosed area after identifying themselves to law enforcement.119 GPE26 GPE[LOCATION]17 [ORGANIZATION] Classes [PERSON] After 90 of Staff Got Sick After ORG33 Shots[ORGANIZATION]70 A small town school district was forced to cancel all classes [PERSON] after nearly all of its staff got sick after mRNA shots. All [ORGANIZATION]70 staff members for the school district received their second ORG33 mRNA shots DATE29. The district announced on [ORGANIZATION]0 that classes would be cancelled [PERSON] due to lack of staff.[ORGANIZATION]71 Mainstream Media Losing Their Minds Over [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]72 Consider the following. [PERSON] has a larger number of people over [ORGANIZATION]1 4.4 million compared to only 1.8 million in GPE[ORGANIZATION]8. We know that the age group most likely to succumb to [PERSON] are the senior set, i.e., [ORGANIZATION]2 and up. You would expect more people would die in [PERSON] given that dramatically larger number of senior citizens running around, especially given that [PERSON] is open for business. But that did not happen. Total deaths in GPE[ORGANIZATION]8 as of this writing is 54,892 dead compared to [PERSON]s 32,285. What separates [PERSON] [PERSON] from the Governors of GPE29, GPE[ORGANIZATION]8, GPE[ORGANIZATION]7, [PERSON]0 and [PERSON]1 is that our Governor protected the seniors inhabiting nursing homes and assisted living facilities. The Governors of those blue states allowed [PERSON] infected people to be housed in senior facilities. PERSON37 reportedly has the blood of more than [ORGANIZATION]8,000 on his hands as a result of his insane policy.[ORGANIZATION]73 [ORGANIZATION] amp38 ORG32 Study Suggests mRNA [PERSON] Might Permanently Alter DNA After All[ORGANIZATION]74 If our cells become permanent rather than temporary [PERSON] producing factories due to permanent alteration of our genomic DNA, this could lead to serious autoimmune problems [PERSON] reading.[ORGANIZATION]75 ORG33 Now Dosing Children [ORGANIZATION]3 With Experimental mRNA [PERSON] as Part of Study[ORGANIZATION]76 [ORGANIZATION]4, vaccine firm [ORGANIZATION] announced that they will be testing their new experimental mRNA vaccine on young children. The pharmaceutical firm claims that this new phase of human testing is merely to gauge the safety and effectiveness of their new [ORGANIZATION] vaccine. However, this is an unprecedented corporate practice  never before have Government regulators allowed an experimental technology to forego [ORGANIZATION]5 of animal testing and human trials and careful follow-up studies all normally conducted before a new vaccine product is released into the general population. Moreover, ORG33 will be taking otherwise perfectly healthy young children who are at zero risk of ever becoming ill from the [ORGANIZATION] disease and then exposing them to an experimental gene-based mRNA vaccine technology. According to the ORG35 press release, the large scale vaccine experiment is the second phase of their Kid COVE Study is expected to enroll no less than 6,750 healthy children in the [PERSON] and [PERSON]2 ranging [DATE] and 11 [ORGANIZATION]5 old.[ORGANIZATION]77 [ORGANIZATION] on ORG36 to Censor More Books[ORGANIZATION]78 Under the guise of concern for the book readers ability to navigate available information about the coronavirus pandemic, more media pressure is mounting on ORG36, that controls a huge chunk of the online market  to start banning more books. And while ORG36 is already, and very controversially from the point of view of free speech supporters, banning some books, other types of activists and their media outlets clearly think that should only be the beginning.[ORGANIZATION]79 PERSON38 Says Origin of Recall Effort Has Ties to Right-Wing Militia [ORGANIZATION], ORG37 [PERSON], Three Percenters, [PERSON] Video[ORGANIZATION]80 Embattled GPE[ORGANIZATION]8 Governor [PERSON] PERSON38 D said right-wing groups like ORG37 supporters and [PERSON] are behind efforts to boot him from office on DATE[ORGANIZATION]7 during an appearance on The View. Republicans launched a robust effort to recall [PERSON] PERSON38 and gathered more than 2 million of the 1.5 million signatures needed by the [ORGANIZATION]7 deadline.

The nature of these things, the up-or-down question, the zero-sum nature of the question is challenging, its vexing.1DATE5 Number of [PERSON]1ns Who Believe [PERSON]3 is [PERSON] to the [PERSON]4 Has Doubled Poll[ORGANIZATION]84 [PERSON]3 has overtaken [PERSON]5 as the greatest threat to [PERSON]6, according to 45 per cent of [PERSON]1ns surveyed in a new ORG39 poll, more than double the percentage of those who said so in [ORGANIZATION]8. [ORGANIZATION]9, [PERSON]1ns were equally as likely to say that either [PERSON]3 or [PERSON]5 posed the greatest threat to [PERSON]6. The new figures follow [PERSON]3s role in being the [STREET] of origin of the ongoing [ORGANIZATION] pandemic, which originated in the city of [PERSON]7. The poll conducted [PERSON]0 found that 45 per cent of [PERSON]1ns view [PERSON]3 as the greatest threat to the [PERSON]4, in contrast to 22 per cent of those polled [PERSON]1. 26 per cent of [PERSON]1ns view [PERSON]5 as the countrys greatest threat, a small increase from 23 per cent in [ORGANIZATION]8.[ORGANIZATION]85 ORG40 Refused to Act on [PERSON]2 ORG41 Report That Proved [LOCATION]s Wildly Anticompetitive Behavior[ORGANIZATION]86 [LOCATION]s march toward overwhelming search, digital ad, and mobile OS market dominance was visible from orbit to everyone but the most casual technology observer as early as in [PERSON]2 but the PERSON41 administration [ORGANIZATION] experts rejected it. It was in [PERSON]3 that they decided not to sue [LOCATION] after conducting a probe, launched in [PERSON]4, into the [ORGANIZATION] monopolistic behavior.

FAC1 and FAC2, the intersection where PERSON43 died, is surrounded by barricades and patrolled by black-bloc activists who have transformed the memorial site into an autonomous zone.

[PERSON] PERSON15 stood in front of the cameras DATE51 night, DATE52, and heaped lies upon lies, doing his best but failing miserably to make it sound like he actually cared about our health and wellbeing. His actions, along with his stone-cold black eyes, speak louder than his words. The [PERSON]4 government, under this mans leadership, has become the biggest human trafficker in the world. His policies in DATE53 have created a humanitarian crisis at the [PERSON]4 Mexican border that is devastating tens of thousands of lives. My sources inside ORG48 tell me that upwards of 5,000 migrants a day are now crossing illegally into [PERSON]6. Most give themselves up to the border agents and repeat over and over the one word they have been trained to utter in English, asylum. At this rate, we are looking at 140,000 migrants per month flooding into [PERSON]1n cities. That would add up to a staggering 1.7 million per year. We have evidence that the [PERSON]4 government is communicating with [PERSON]1n leftist [ORGANIZATION]s on the ground and working with the cartels leading the caravans on the other side of the border.

[DATE], DATE55 the 16th Amendment to [PERSON]6 Constitution was ratified, authorizing the federal government to impose income taxes on individuals. An amendment to a tariff act in DATE58 had attempted to do this, but since it was clearly unconstitutional, [ORGANIZATION]0 struck it down. As a result, and mostly under the banner of bleeding the rich, the 16th Amendment was promoted and passed. PERSON48 signed it into law and in DATE59 income taxes began. Then the other horrible acts of DATE55. The 17th Amendment to [PERSON]6 Constitution was ratified, taking the powers of the states and transferring them to GPE21, by mandating the popular election of senators. Previously, senators were appointed by state legislatures, restraining the power of the national government. This change gave political parties immediate and massive power, nearly all of which was consolidated in the city of GPE21. PERSON48 also signed [ORGANIZATION], which had passed [ORGANIZATION]1 [ORGANIZATION]0. This system called the Aldrich Plan, and promoted by Sen.

The Great Replacement is a term coined by French author PERSON63 in his [ORGANIZATION]8 book The Great Replacement, in which he proposes the theory that indigenous French people are being demographically replaced by non-[PERSON]an peoples at a time when [PERSON] was the subject of repeated terrorist attacks by ORG91ists.

My policies were working better than theyve ever seen on the southern border, PERSON18 said, adding The wall was almost complete. We just had to fix little sections, complete little sections that had to be together. But theyre destroying our country, PERSON18 continued, adding People are coming by the hundreds of thousands. Young children are coming in and they leave their homes and they come up because they think its going to be so wonderful, and frankly, our country cant handle it.237 GPE49 to [ORGANIZATION], No More Hotel Stays Report238 ORG134 is reportedly going to build reception centres for asylum seekers, with insiders admitting that putting them up in hotels created a pull factor for migrants. The purpose-built accommodations are also supposed to be cheaper, with the current method of dispersing illegals, migrants, and asylum seekers across the country in hotels proving costly to the taxpayer.239 A Womans Perspective [PERSON] PERSON15 is Feminizing the [PERSON]4 ORG98 After PERSON41 [ORGANIZATION] Combat Let me begin by being very clear and reiterate my own stance regarding women in the [PERSON]4 ORG98. Women do not belong in physical combat. Not because they are not competent, and there are many positions within the military that women are highly qualified for. On the ground combat is not one of them. Contrary to what folks on the left seem to believe, men and women are different, as men have thicker bone density and are generally physically stronger. Of course there are exceptions but as a general rule, men are more fit for combat than women. The proof is shown in recent reports which find that women in the military cannot keep up with the men in physical testing, so rather than acknowledge the differences between the two genders, the [PERSON]4 military is considering lowering the physical standards for women by rethinking about reversing their gender neutral physical testing. Research showed that [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], which is the same for male and female soldiers, was leading to lower results for women with a knock-on effect for promotions, The ORG136 reported. An early FAC10 study showed that women were failing the [ORGANIZATION] at a rate of [ORGANIZATION]2 per cent, while only 10 percent of men did. So rather than say, okay, there are plenty of critical military jobs that women can and do perform without weakening the [PERSON]4 military by lowering the physical standards required for combat, the [PERSON]4 military under [PERSON] PERSON15 has decided weakening the testing standards, therefore weakening the military as a whole, is better becausechecks notesyes, [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION] and Their Members242 ORG23 has announced new rules surrounding groups, including putting members who repeatedly violate its policies on probation and limiting the reach of problematic groups. The rules are part of the platforms continued efforts to tackle misinformation and harmful content. The group feature on ORG23 allows people with common interests to come together and discuss issues. However, left to their own devices, ORG23 suggests that groups have become one of the greatest tools in spreading misinformation and so it wants to get involved in policing what people talk about.243 [ORGANIZATION] Ever Black and Asian Transgender Star Model PERSON114 Makes History in [LOCATION] as She Reveals How She Overcame Homelessness to Achieve Her Fashion Dream2[PERSON] ORG137 has revealed the first ever black and Asian transgender model to grace the pages of its [LOCATION]14 [ORGANIZATION] Issue. Though the iconic magazine doesnt launch until [LOCATION]15, the ORG137 [ORGANIZATION] Issue ORG26 account has been unveiling one model a day throughout [LOCATION]16  and [TIME], they made waves with the announcement that [PERSON]7-born model, dancer, actor, and activist PERSON114, [LOCATION]17, is joining the likes of [LOCATION] and PERSON116 in the DATE[ORGANIZATION]8 edition. PERSON117, who is the second trans model to pose for [PERSON], opened up to Good Morning [PERSON]1 about her boundary-breaking accomplishment, gushing I never imagined that I would be born in a time when something like this would happen for someone with my skin tone and for someone with my background.245 Polling Firm Characterizes Asking a Woman Out as a Form of Sexual Harassment246 As a debate over misogyny rages in the GPE49, polling firm [ORGANIZATION] recently released a survey that characterized asking a woman out for a drink as a form of sexual harassment. Yes, really. After the tragic abduction and murder of [DATE] PERSON80 in [LOCATION]1, protesters demanded all manner of new measures, including a 6pm curfew for men. Others are now pushing for misogyny to be made a hate crime, as if murderers would have second thoughts about abducting and killing a woman because of a law that primarily targets speech. Absolutely none of these professional activists demanded that the law be changed so women who carry pepper spray arent hit with the same legal penalty as they would be for carrying a gun, which is currently the law in the GPE49.247 [PERSON] Gov. PERSON118 [PERSON] Expand Abortion Coverage Without Limits248 [PERSON] Gov. PERSON118 signed a law on DATE[LOCATION]17 that requires state taxpayers to fund abortion in any circumstance. The law ends a ban on abortion coverage for insurance plans. The ban was originally enacted by former Republican Gov. [PERSON] in [PERSON]4 and allowed the Affordable Care Act to only cover abortions in cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother.2[ORGANIZATION]  1 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]294  2 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION][LOCATION]178  3 [PERSON]6[ORGANIZATION]3  4 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]266  5 [PERSON]6[ORGANIZATION]28  6 [PERSON]6[ORGANIZATION]7  7 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION][LOCATION]176  8 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]211  9 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]203  10 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]268  11 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION][LOCATION]170  [ORGANIZATION]7 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]201  [ORGANIZATION]8 [PERSON]6[ORGANIZATION]26  14 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]229  15 [PERSON]6634  16 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]256  17 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]207  18 [PERSON]6[ORGANIZATION]22  19 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]2[LOCATION]17  20 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]2[ORGANIZATION]8  21 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]221  22 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]219  23 [PERSON]6632  24 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]209  25 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION][LOCATION]172  26 [PERSON]6610  [LOCATION]17 [PERSON]6630  28 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]240  29 [PERSON]6626  30 [PERSON]6[ORGANIZATION]24  31 [PERSON]6[ORGANIZATION]9  32 [PERSON]6[ORGANIZATION]1  DATE5 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]205  34 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]215  35 [PERSON]6614  36 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]264  37 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]286  38 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]284  39 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]225  40 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]280  41 [PERSON]6487  42 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]288  43 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]236  [PERSON] [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]260  45 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]262  46 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]282  47 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]238  48 [PERSON]6640  [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]290  50 [PERSON]6648  51 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]246  52 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]254  53 [PERSON]6[ORGANIZATION]20  54 [PERSON]6638  55 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]217  56 [PERSON]6602  57 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]298  58 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]242  59 [PERSON]6600  60 [PERSON]6604  61 [PERSON]6628  62 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]223  63 [PERSON]6606  64 [PERSON]6608  [ORGANIZATION]2 [PERSON]6636  66 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]2DATE5  67 [PERSON]6622  68 [PERSON]6620  69 [PERSON]6484  70 [PERSON]6489  71 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]258  72 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]248  73 [PERSON]6642  74 [PERSON]66[ORGANIZATION]7  75 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]292  76 [PERSON]66[PERSON]  77 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]252  78 [PERSON]6646  79 [PERSON]6DATE[ORGANIZATION]2  80 [PERSON]6616  81 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]2[PERSON]  82 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION]250  83 [PERSON][ORGANIZATION][LOCATION]174  84  85 topheadline  86  87 topheadline  88  89 topheadline  90  91 topheadline  92  93 topheadline  94  95 topheadline  96  97 topheadline  98  99 topheadline  100  101 topheadline  102  103 topheadline  104  105 topheadline  106  107 topheadline  108  109 topheadline  110  111 topheadline  1[ORGANIZATION]7  1[ORGANIZATION]8 topheadline  114  115 topheadline  116  117 topheadline  118  119 topheadline  [ORGANIZATION]70  [ORGANIZATION]71 topheadline  [ORGANIZATION]72  [ORGANIZATION]73 topheadline  [ORGANIZATION]74  [ORGANIZATION]75 topheadline  [ORGANIZATION]76  [ORGANIZATION]77 topheadline  [ORGANIZATION]78  [ORGANIZATION]79 topheadline  [ORGANIZATION]80  [ORGANIZATION]81 topheadline  [ORGANIZATION]82  1DATE5 topheadline  [ORGANIZATION]84  [ORGANIZATION]85 topheadline  [ORGANIZATION]86  [ORGANIZATION]87 topheadline  [ORGANIZATION]88  [ORGANIZATION]89 topheadline  140  141 topheadline  142  143 topheadline  1[PERSON]  145 topheadline  146  147 topheadline  148  1[ORGANIZATION] topheadline  150  151 topheadline  152  153 topheadline  154  155 topheadline  156  157 topheadline  158  159 topheadline  160  161 topheadline  162  163 topheadline  164  1[ORGANIZATION]2 topheadline  166  167 topheadline  168  169 topheadline  170  171 topheadline  172  173 topheadline  174  175 topheadline  176  177 topheadline  178  179 topheadline  180  181 topheadline  182  183 topheadline  184  185 topheadline  186  187 topheadline  188  189 topheadline  190  191 topheadline  192  193 topheadline  194  195 topheadline  196  197 topheadline  198  199 topheadline  200  201 topheadline  202  203 topheadline  204  205 topheadline  206  207 topheadline  208  209 topheadline  210  211 topheadline  2[ORGANIZATION]7  2[ORGANIZATION]8 topheadline  214  215 topheadline  216  217 topheadline  218  219 topheadline  220  221 topheadline  222  223 topheadline  224  225 topheadline  226  2[LOCATION]17 topheadline  228  229 topheadline  230  231 topheadline  232  2DATE5 topheadline  234  235 topheadline  236  237 topheadline  238  239 topheadline  240  241 topheadline  242  243 topheadline  2[PERSON]  245 topheadline  246  247 topheadline  248  2[ORGANIZATION] topheadline"

If it makes you wonder why [ORGANIZATION], who isnt an elected official, would have anything to do with the stimulus, youre probably not alone. But he is, and he told [PERSON] of [PERSON] virtual event that he is working to get billions of dollars added into the stimulus package to give to [ORGANIZATION], ORG6. If hes successful, that money would not go to struggling [PERSON]ns but, rather, outside of [PERSON] for vaccines in developing countries.

The injuries include one officer losing eyesight after being targeted with a laser. [ORGANIZATION] Chief PERSON8 told reporters on [ORGANIZATION] that 14 of his officers sustained injuries during [TIME] protests, according to a tweet from ORG8 reporter [PERSON]. The injures included eight officers being struck by incendiary devices, one eye injury from a laser, four struck by rocks or bricks, and one sprained ankle, the chief [PERSON] of [PERSON]ns Think [ORGANIZATION] A survey published by ORG9, from data collected [ORGANIZATION], shows that [PERSON]ns have little faith that they are receiving fair and balanced reporting from their media outlets. The poll, conducted in [LOCATION] and [ORGANIZATION], shows that as many as 79 percent of [PERSON]ns think news organizations are biased toward one side in the political and ideological schism. This is an increase of 7 percentage points compared to DATE9 After Peddling [ORGANIZATION]0-Russia Hit-Pieces Before DATE10 Election  MSM Totally Ignores [ORGANIZATION]1 Bombshells on [ORGANIZATION]2 The mainstream media is silent following an explosive [PERSON] night interview with [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]1, a former [PERSON]0 veteran of DATE11 who provided text, email, and anecdotal evidence that he was brought in by the [ORGANIZATION]4 family to manage a venture with a [PERSON]1-linked Chinese entity, and that they concealed [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]4s involvement.93 [PERSON]2 Hosts Top Epidemiologists, Authors of the Great Barrington Declaration94 From DATE12, the [PERSON]n Institute for Economic Research hosted a remarkable meeting of top epidemiologists, economists, and journalists, to discuss the global emergency created by the unprecedented use of state compulsion in the management of the Covid-19 pandemic. The result is The Great Barrington Declaration, which urges a [ORGANIZATION] strategy. After a brief explanation of the strategy, and a discussion of the astonishing costs of lockdown, the Declaration concludes Schools and universities should be open for in-person teaching. Extracurricular activities, such as sports, should be resumed. Young low-risk adults should work normally, rather than from home. Restaurants and other businesses should open. Arts, music, sport and other cultural activities should resume. The primary authors and signers of the document are Dr. [ORGANIZATION]6, Professor, Medicine, [PERSON]4.

An organization of attorneys, calling themselves ORG21, is effectively encouraging military personnel to refuse orders to keep peace in the streets following the election if left-wing ORG22 and ORG23 terrorists lay waste to cities. GPE4 [PERSON] National Guard Major PERSON21, a Democrat operative who ran unsuccessfully for [PERSON] in GPE7 in DATE13, is exploiting his military bona fides to push his left-wing partisan agenda against President [ORGANIZATION]0 with the help of the fake news media. He is complaining that ORG25 did too much to prevent rioting terrorists from spreading their orgy of destruction following the death of crackhead serial felon PERSON22 in [LOCATION]. PERSON23 is a posterchild for ORG21, a left-wing lawfare group that is attempting to convince GPE2 troops to stand down and allow the country to be decimated by anarchists who want President [ORGANIZATION]0 removed from office following the election.99 ORG26 Mob Violently Chases Jewish Men Showing Solidarity At [LOCATION] Protest100 Jewish men who said they were trying to show solidarity with ORG23 protesters were violently chased away by the mob and ridiculed as being part of the synagogue of [LOCATION], according to disturbing video posted online.

There is always a lot going on that we dont have time to get to on the air, the [ORGANIZATION] PERSON29 [TIME] host told his audience, but there is something specific going on behind the screens that we did feel like we should tell you about. On DATE14, we received from a source a collection of confidential documents related to the [ORGANIZATION]4 family, PERSON29 went on. We believe they are authentic, theyre real and theyre damning. PERSON29 added he was contacted by the source while in [PERSON]0 preparing to interview [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]1, a former business associate of [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]4, who detailed PERSON30 purported knowledge of his sons foreign dealings on the ORG28 show [PERSON] night. We texted a producer in [PERSON]1 and asked him to send those documents to us in [PERSON]2,  PERSON29 explained. And he did that, so DATE16 [TIME] of DATE17, he shipped the documents [TIME] to [PERSON]3 with a large national carrier, a brand-name company that weve used, youve used, countless times with never a single problem. But the documents never arrived in [PERSON]0, PERSON29 said. [PERSON] morning we received word from the shipping company that our package had been opened and the contents were missing. The documents had disappeared.105 ORG29 Considers Suing PERSON31 as [PERSON]3 Governor [PERSON] on Closures106 When [PERSON]3 public health officials announced guidelines for reopening theme parks that essentially guarantee that parks in [PERSON]0, [PERSON]4, and [PERSON]5 counties wont be able to open until perhaps DATE18, heads of the respective theme parks rightfully blasted [ORGANIZATION]n PERSON31, citing their successes in reopening in other states and countries and alleging that his guidelines have no scientific basis. DATE19, the Executive Director of the [PERSON]3 Attractions and Parks Association, of which ORG29 is a member, said that a lawsuit was under consideration and all options are open at this point. By [ORGANIZATION], sources within the industry and within ORG29, speaking on condition of anonymity, stated that one option ORG29 was looking into was was moving as many jobs as possible out of [PERSON]3. Obviously the company cant pick ORG29land up and move, but the company has a massive footprint in [PERSON]3, both in [PERSON]0 and [PERSON]4 counties. [ORGANIZATION]1 alluded to that potential in a [ORGANIZATION] [TIME] blog post.107 [ORGANIZATION]2 Bans [ORGANIZATION] Store108 [ORGANIZATION]2 is being accused of deliberately targeting a [PERSON]6 veteran-owned business that has a page on the platform because the merchandise they sell features images of President Donald [ORGANIZATION]0, even though they sell merchandise around politicians on both sides of the aisle. The apparel company, [PERSON]n AF, had 1.6 million followers when it was permanently banned DATE20 [ORGANIZATION] PERSON29s [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]4 Documents Reportedly Located110 A package containing documents relating to Democratic presidential nominee [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]4s scandal-plagued son [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]4 that went missing while being shipped to ORG28 host [ORGANIZATION] PERSON29 in [PERSON]3 has been located, according to a report. The package was first brought up on [TIME] by PERSON29 on his program [ORGANIZATION] PERSON29 [TIME]. PERSON29 said a source had sent his team a collection of confidential documents related to the [ORGANIZATION]4 family that he believed to be authentic and damning.111 [PERSON] Delete [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] Tweet After Severe Backlash and [PERSON] Threats112 [ORGANIZATION]4 stepped out of line when they posted messages on [ORGANIZATION]5 and [ORGANIZATION]2 congratulating Judge PERSON37 on her new job as a member of the [PERSON]6 Supreme [STREET]. The backlash against the message was so strong and vicious that they deleted the post.113 PERSON38 Quits the [ORGANIZATION]7 Over Censorship Of [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]4 Article114 Prominent journalist PERSON38 on [ORGANIZATION] resigned from The [ORGANIZATION]7, a news organization he co-founded, after editors sought to censor an article he wrote about [ORGANIZATION]9 expos on documents retrieved from a [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]4 laptop. PERSON39 is best known for his DATE21 reporting on leaked mass-surveillance documents from former [PERSON]0 contractor [ORGANIZATION]0. His work for [PERSON]1 won the Pulitzer Prize. The [ORGANIZATION]7s editors, in violation of my contractual right of editorial freedom, censored an article I wrote DATE17, refusing to publish it unless I remove all sections critical of Democratic presidential candidate [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]4, PERSON39 wrote in a blog post. The brute censorship DATE17 of my article  about the [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]4 materials and [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]4s conduct regarding [PERSON]7 and [PERSON]8, as well my critique of the medias rank-closing attempt, in a deeply unholy union with [ORGANIZATION] and the intelligence community, to suppress its revelations  eroded the last justification I could cling to for [LOCATION] Gov. [ORGANIZATION]1 Criticism of [PERSON]1 Nursing Home Deaths a Conspiracy116 Governor [PERSON] said [ORGANIZATION] on [PERSON]3 The View that [PERSON]1 [ORGANIZATION]s more than 6,000 nursing home deaths allegedly caused by his order to put patients infected with coronavirus back in facilities was a conspiracy theory. Comment [ORGANIZATION]1 should be indicted on multiple murder charges. Note how [ORGANIZATION]1 thinks he can pin this on [ORGANIZATION]0. 117 Gun Violence, Fatalities Reach DATE22 High in GPE20118 GPE20 WHAM  DATE23 into DATE24, 31 people have been shot and killed in [LOCATION], the highest number of gun-related deaths since DATE25. In total, 275 people have been victims of gun violence DATE26  also a record since DATE25, which is when information on [ORGANIZATION] dates back to.119 [ORGANIZATION]3 Tweet of Violent Despots Stirs GPE22 [ORGANIZATION]8ors Race120 GPE23, GPE24 [ORGANIZATION]4  DATE27 before the [PERSON] election, GPE22s mayoral race is scrutinizing a tweet from the DATE10 primary campaign. DATE29, [ORGANIZATION]8or [ORGANIZATION]5 campaign released a statement taking challenger [ORGANIZATION]6 to task for writing in violent despots like [ORGANIZATION]7 and [ORGANIZATION]8 on her DATE10 ballot. The tweet, from [ORGANIZATION]8 1, DATE10, also includes write-in votes for PERSON[ORGANIZATION]6, [ORGANIZATION]0, [ORGANIZATION]1, [ORGANIZATION]2, plus others. Most are figures on the global stage responsible for the deaths of millions of people over [ORGANIZATION]1 Irresponsible [ORGANIZATION] Leadership Caused Many [PERSON] Deaths122 Another major error that drove up the death toll was state leaderships decision to [STREET] infected patients into nursing homes, against federal guidelines.9 According to an analysis10,11 by [PERSON]5, which included data reported by [ORGANIZATION]8 22, [PERSON], an average of 42 of all [PERSON] deaths in the GPE2 had occurred in nursing homes, assisted living and other long-term care facilities. This is extraordinary, considering this group accounts for just 0.62 of the population. By and large, nursing homes are ill equipped to care for [ORGANIZATION] theyre set up to care for elderly patients  whether they are generally healthy or have chronic health problems  these facilities are rarely equipped to quarantine and care for people with highly infectious disease. Its logical to assume that comingling infected patients with noninfected ones in a nursing home would result in exaggerated death rates, as the elderly are far more prone to die from any infection, including the common cold. We also learned, early on, that the elderly were disproportionately vulnerable to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Yet ordering infected patients into nursing homes with the most vulnerable population of all is exactly what several Democrat governors decided to do, including [PERSON]1 Gov. [PERSON] GPE26 Gov. PERSON[LOCATION]2, GPE27 Gov. [ORGANIZATION]5, GPE28 Gov. [ORGANIZATION]6 and [PERSON]3 Gov. [ORGANIZATION]n PERSON31. [PERSON]6 published an investigation14 [DATE], [PERSON], comparing a [PERSON]1 nursing home that followed [ORGANIZATION]1s misguided order with one that refused, opting to follow the federal guidelines instead. The difference was stark. By [ORGANIZATION]4, the GPE29 nursing home  which followed [ORGANIZATION]1s directive  had lost 18 residents to [PERSON], thanks to lack of isolation and inadequate infection control. Half the staff about 50 people and 58 patients were infected and fell ill. In comparison, [PERSON]7, a 320-bed nursing home located in the same county as GPE29, which refused to follow the states directive and did not admit any patient suspected of having [PERSON], did not have a single [PERSON] death. A similar trend has been observed in other areas. Comment Wilful murder, not irresponsible leaders. Akin to the old [ORGANIZATION]7 of tossing an infected body into the fort that was under seige.123 [ORGANIZATION]8 Debunks Claims He Spread Anti-Vaxxer Conspiracy Theories124 [ORGANIZATION]8 responded to criticism that he was spreading anti-covid vaccine conspiracy theories during his podcast with [ORGANIZATION]9 by posting a [PERSON]8 clip in which [ORGANIZATION] admitted that in one [PERSON] vaccine trial, 80 of participants suffered side-effects. Following a failed outrage campaign to have [PERSON]0 podcast with [PERSON]1 deplatformed altogether, critics then turned to the content itself, accusing [PERSON]2 of facilitating dangerous conspiracy theories about [PERSON] vaccines.125 Looking Back on [ORGANIZATION]5 as an [ORGANIZATION] User126 I had owned the [PERSON] for [ORGANIZATION]6 when I went to a different local computer store, ORG[ORGANIZATION]6 in [PERSON], GPE31, to purchase a 45 10-count box of 3.5-inch floppy disks. My mother waited in the car while I ran in. And there on the table I saw it. The [ORGANIZATION]  the first one I had ever encountered. It was sitting there, fired up and running an animation demo of some sort. All of the things that made me so excited about the system before flooded back to me right there. I bought the box of floppies, but they never made it into that [PERSON]intosh. [TIME] at the dinner table, I started off a conversation I had been frenziedly honing in my mind all [TIME]. And, I carried it off well, it seems my parents agreed to changing gears, and [ORGANIZATION]7 my father returned the [PERSON]intosh to the [ORGANIZATION]0 dealer and we went and put a deposit down on the 1,285 [ORGANIZATION]. Incidentally, It was always called the [ORGANIZATION] 1000, but no one really noticed until the [ORGANIZATION] 500 and 2000 landed in 1987.127 GPE28 Gun Store Owner [PERSON] in Sales Following Protests, Says Customers Were Scared After Riots128 A GPE28 gun store owner made her biggest sales in [ORGANIZATION]8 after rioting in GPE32 [TIME] after a PERSON22 protest took [STREET]. Lisa [ORGANIZATION]8o is the owner of [ORGANIZATION]1 just a few miles north of GPE32.129 Mindlessness Fuels Tyranny130 Its no surprise that Dr. [PERSON]4, with a vested interest in perpetuating the current Covid-19 narrative, has called the Great Barrington Declaration nonsense and very dangerous. Just as angry and closed-minded are the social media reactions from some ordinary people. We will lose many lives, they warn, if we give credence to the Declaration. The fearful are sure only they, not the signers of the Declaration, care about the lives of others. As [PERSON]5 writes, Much of humanity [ORGANIZATION]9 appears to perversely enjoy being duped into the irrational fear that any one of us, regardless of age or health, is at the mercy of a brutal beast categorically more lethal than is any other danger that weve ever confronted. Those reacting against the Declaration seem to be stuck in time, living in [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] when ignorance of the viruss virulence was peaking. There is so much more we now know about Covid-19, yet the fearful will not consider new information or alternative theories.131 [ORGANIZATION]2 Remains Silent on Secret Backdoors in Popular Tech132 The [PERSON]0 [ORGANIZATION]2 is refusing to reveal its new policies on the placing of back doors into commercial tech products. While the agency may argue these backdoors are valuable for national security, they present privacy concerns and are a risk to national security should foreign adversaries manage to exploit them. [ORGANIZATION]0, a former [ORGANIZATION]2 employee, now labeled a traitor, revealed how the [ORGANIZATION]2 enters into agreements with [PERSON]6-based technology companies to give them special access back doors to their products. These backdoors allow the [ORGANIZATION]2 and other government agencies to access personal data without a warrant.133 Our [PERSON] Plan Would Minimize Mortality and [ORGANIZATION] Damage134 The [ORGANIZATION] plan in the Great Barrington Declaration would minimize both [PERSON] mortality and lockdown-induced collateral damage on other health outcomes. In line with pre-[PERSON] pandemic preparedness plans, the declaration calls for better protecting the old and other high-risk groups, for whom [PERSON] is more dangerous than influenza. By contrast, for children, [PERSON] is less dangerous than influenza. Children and low-risk young adults should be allowed to live near normal lives as they face greater medical, psychological and economic harms from lockdowns than from [PERSON]. Immunity among low-risk young adults could also shorten the length of the pandemic, making it easier for older people to protect themselves. Denying in-person teaching to students is harmful to their education and physical and mental health, with working-class children hardest hit. Online schooling puts a disproportional burden on our children, despite their own minimal risk. For [ORGANIZATION] kept day care and schools open throughout the height of the pandemic, and among the 1.8 million children of that age, there were zero [PERSON] deaths without masks used or physical distancing. Neither was there any excess risk for in-person teachers compared with the average of other professions. Some argue that it is impossible to separate older and younger generations. While 100 separation is impossible, lockdowns have successfully shifted infection risk from the professional class to the working class and nursing home residents. It is no more challenging to shift infection risk from high-mortality-risk older people to low-mortality-risk younger adults, including the young bankers, attorneys, journalists and scientists who are now protected.135 [ORGANIZATION] Ordered [ORGANIZATION] Not to [LOCATION], Looters136 [PERSON]6  The police in [LOCATION] were told not to arrest anyone. Deputy Police Commissioner [PERSON]7 allegedly ordered police not to arrest any of the rioters. That makes no sense. If you dont arrest them, they will just go ransack another business. Yet, somehow the police did manage to arrest ninety of them. Will the arresting cops be punished?137 [LOCATION] Stores Beg Thieves to Leave Them Alone After Third Night of Looting138 [LOCATION] businesses put up signs begging for looters to leave them alone as thieves ran rampant for the third night amid unrest over the police shooting death of a [ORGANIZATION]3 black man.

Bro, grab what you want, one woman is heard saying.1[ORGANIZATION]6 The Dems Deplorable Word150 If we cant rule [PERSON], then let there be no [PERSON]! Is this the corner into which the Democrats have driven themselves? I think it is. In [ORGANIZATION]8, the world lived in fear of a nuclear war that would destroy all life on earth. Memories of World War II were quite vivid, and people didnt find it hard to imagine something even worse. In DATE[ORGANIZATION]6 [ORGANIZATION]8 published another Chronicle of Narnia, The Magicians Nephew. In it he told of a world called GPE37. There, in ancient times, two queens battled for supremacy. When she was about to lose that war, Queen [ORGANIZATION]9 spoke a magic spell, The Deplorable Word, which wiped out every living thing in GPE37, leaving only dust and ruins. Are Democrats getting desperate enough to speak their own Deplorable Word? Consider their policies, as proposed by their candidates They have reached a point where there is almost nothing they wont do to get power. Power to impose their socialist fantasies on 350 million people. Power to stifle even the most trivial dissent. Power to re-engineer all our basic social institutions. Power to end [PERSON] as we know it-forever. Communists have always liked to say you have to break eggs to make an omelet, although never in history did they ever get past the egg-breaking stage. But what were talking about here is breaking all the eggs. All of them. And depend on this if they ever do get back into power, Democrats will change the rules so that theyll never be turned out of power again. Not without a mammoth expenditure of blood, toil, tears, and sweat.151 [ORGANIZATION]0s [PERSON] Will it be Enough to [ORGANIZATION] is an acquired skill of ORG63. Any Republican national candidate has to overcome a percentage of stolen votes. But DATE26, the Covid-19 plandemic has provided the Democrats with the perfect backdrop for massive cheating mail-in ballots. The use of fraudulent mail-in ballots and post-election ballot harvesting is well-documented and will occur at unprecedented levels. In addition to the normal ORG64 cheating, PERSON80 of ORG65 has recently exposed that 353 out of 3,141 of the nations counties have more registered voters than their current population. So the question is how far will the fraud go and where will it occur? The real concern is in the eight swing states of [LOCATION], GPE40, GPE26, GPE28, GPE41, [LOCATION], GPE43, and GPE44. These eight states will determine the election.153 Van Full of Explosives Discovered in GPE45 on Third Night of Rioting1[LOCATION]2 The bomb squad is on the scene at this hour.155 [ORGANIZATION] Smash SUV Windows, Pull [PERSON] Out156 Viral video from [TIME] of raucous protests in [LOCATION] shows baton-wielding cops smashing a cars windows, yanking the driver out and removing a kid from the backseat.

The incident took [STREET] at approximately 1115 local time. According to media reports, police initially deployed non-lethal munitions to stop the assailant but were forced to open fire with live rounds after he lunged at officers.

Specifically, [PERSON]9 claimed the app was in violation of the rules because its primary purpose is to [STREET] affiliate traffic to a website or provide a webview of a website without permission from the website owner or [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]35 Video on [ORGANIZATION] in GPE65 Goes Viral, Bypasses Media and Opposition Narrative241 We are living in an era where the media is increasingly adept at manufacturing reality. What a politician actually says is less important than how journalists later portray it and how commentators and other political players use it to further their political goals. The opposition is trying to use this time-tested strategy since [PERSON] [TIME] following [ORGANIZATION]36 and [ORGANIZATION] PiS leader [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]35 online speech concerning abortion and the ongoing anti-abortion protests. [PERSON]17 leader referred to facts. He stated that the protesters are attacking churches, profaning statues and interrupting church services. He evaluated that we must defend ourselves in such cases and urged people, just like other nationalist politicians are doing, to oppose the vandalization of religious sites.242 [ORGANIZATION] by [ORGANIZATION]2 Despite Not Breaking Rules243 The founder of a mastectomy support group on [ORGANIZATION]2 claims that the platform repeatedly censors its content despite their content not violating [ORGANIZATION]2s community standards. [ORGANIZATION]2 admitted that the content was removed in error but it continues to happen. The founder of the group, [ORGANIZATION]38, said that [ORGANIZATION]2 removed post-mastectomy photos she had posted. The censorship was frustrating considering [ORGANIZATION]2s community guidelines allow mastectomy photos.244 Statues of [ORGANIZATION]39 Attacked Throughout GPE65 by [ORGANIZATION] Protestors245 As the pro-abortion protests become more radicalized and increasingly violent, the protesters and radicals have chosen to vandalize and profane the statues of [LOCATION] [ORGANIZATION]39, considered one of GPE65s greatest heroes. Statutes of the former pope have been targeted in [LOCATION]9, [PERSON]00, [PERSON]01, and [PERSON]02 following the [PERSON]19 landmark ruling [ORGANIZATION]7 that eugenic abortion is unconstitutional. On [PERSON], in the town center of [PERSON]02, which is a short distance from [PERSON]01, a man was brutally attacked by pro-abortion protesters with bats while trying to protect a [ORGANIZATION]39s statue. The gathered protesters initially shouted out vulgar anti-government and anti-church slogans. Several dozen Catholics gathered around the statue in response and began to pray.246 What You Need to Know About The Great Reset247 Story at-a-glance The Great Reset is a new social contract that ties you to it through an electronic ID linked to your bank account and health records, and a social credit ID that will dictate every facet of your life While the [PERSON] pandemic is being used as a justification for the Great Reset movement, the agenda has nothing to do with health and everything to do with a long-term plan to monitor and control the world through digital surveillance and artificial intelligence. The Great Reset and the Fourth Industrial Revolution are rebranded terms for technocracy and the old [ORGANIZATION] melded with the transhumanist movement. Technocracy is an economic system of resource allocation that revolves around technology  in particular artificial intelligence, digital surveillance and [ORGANIZATION] collection  and the digitization of industry and government, which in turn allows for the automation of social engineering and social rule, thereby doing away with the need for democratically elected leadership. While the real plan is to usher in a tech-driven dystopia free of democratic controls, they speak of this plan as a [STREET] to bring us back into harmony with nature In his report, [ORGANIZATION]42 summarizes the Great Reset thus At base, the Great Reset is nothing more, and nothing less, than a great propaganda, marketing rollout campaign for a new brand that the would-be global elite are trying to shove down the publics throats Its just a fresh coat of lipstick on a very old pig. This is The [ORGANIZATION], just redefined. Its just a new label for it. And, as explained by [ORGANIZATION]42, for those who forgot about what the [ORGANIZATION] wasis all about, it was all about centralization of control into fewer hands, globalization and transformation of society through Orwellian surveillance technologies. In other words, its technocracy, where we the people know nothing about the ruling elite while every aspect of our lives is surveilled, tracked and manipulated for their gain. Four key take-aways from [ORGANIZATION]42s research into the Great Reset are 1. The Great Reset has NOTHING to do with a virus, the [PERSON] pandemic or anything else related to public health. 2. The Great Reset is a coordinated agenda that has been [ORGANIZATION]8 in the making  The pandemic is simply being used as a convenient cover for an elitist, globalist agenda that has been planned for [ORGANIZATION]9. 3. The Great Reset is NOT the end of globalization  On the contrary, it is globalization turbo-charged. As noted by [ORGANIZATION]44 in the policy book, [PERSON] The Great Reset, co-written with [ORGANIZATION]45 and cited in [ORGANIZATION]42s report If no one power can enforce order, our world will suffer from a global order deficit. Unless individual nations and international organizations succeed in finding solutions to better collaborate at the global level, we risk entering an age of entropy in which retrenchment, fragmentation, anger and parochialism will increasingly define our global landscape, making it less intelligible and more disorderly. In other words, theres no room for the spontaneously arising social order that occurs when people are allowed to freely interact. Instead, there must be one power to enforce whatever the desired social-environmental-economic-geopolitical order is. 4. This process is not meant to end  The end of the pandemic will not be the end of this totalitarian, digital enslavement agenda. The plan is not to reset the world back to some earlier state that will allow us all to start over with a cleaner environment and more equitable social structures. The plan is to circumvent democracy and shift global governance into the hands of the few.

Im worried that were being divided and we may never recover. Ive never been swayed by conspiracy theories or opinions from the far left or far right, but what Im seeing now has shaken me to my soul. I am worried about our country. Call me old-fashioned, but I really miss the times before technology showed us how we could manipulate each other. Manipulation between individuals was carried out in-person and up close, and you were either physically or verbally manipulated. By guilt, words, physical actions, or general intimidation you had to be up close and personal in order to effectively manipulate someone. And forget about manipulating large groups of people unless you were a well-spoken politician, snake oil salesman-type evangelist, or a cult leader like [ORGANIZATION] or PERSON1 GPE0n Coup Victims Will Not Go Quietly67 This was a Coup. It lacked, at least for the moment, the spilled blood often associated with a classic coup detat but make no mistake about it  this was a coup. A record number of GPE0ns fought an unusual number of hardships to make certain their voices were heard in the selection of our next president. And, given the stark difference in the candidates visions for GPE0s future and the growing national divide, that choice was surely not made lightly. So, when we on the right observed one irregularity after another on [ORGANIZATION] night and [DATE] [TIME], what we needed were answers and transparency. What we got were evasions and coverups. Keep in mind that we have endured over DATE1 DATE2 of dishonesty, hoaxes, threats, wild conspiracy theories and widespread corruption from those on the left. Indeed, Liberals appear to have made sport of treating [PERSON] and his supporters much like a cat treats a litter-box. And we got the message There is no limit to just how low they are willing to sink.

The church is said to regularly provide meals and other supplies for the homeless in the area, and were forced to shut down services because of the violence and destruction. According to ORG2 news in [PERSON], staff at the church had to suspend worship services and their outreach programs for the homeless after someone smashed multiple windows during rioting earlier [ORGANIZATION].70 [ORGANIZATION] Reverse [PERSON]s Policies71 Projected President-Elect [PERSON] reportedly plans to sign a series of executive orders soon after being sworn into office on DATE5 GPE2 DATE6 Violence At Least 4 Killed, 30 Wounded in Shootings So Far This DATE673 GPE3 [ORGANIZATION]  At least 34 people have been shot across GPE2 since [PERSON] evening, four of them fatally.74 COVID Surge Getting Worse in [ORGANIZATION] officials are reporting an explosion of new [ORGANIZATION] cases nationwide, and [PERSON] is not immune.76 Cutting the Cable News Cord77 Sadly, DATE8 major news broadcasts cannot be trusted to deliver news, much less serve as watchdogs.78 [LOCATION] Ballot Tabulators Entered Names of [ORGANIZATION] Count79 Two observers who were at FAC0 in [LOCATION] during the absentee ballot counting process have produced affidavits claiming they witnessed workers create new voter files with information obtained from ballots.80 [ORGANIZATION] Justice With Judge [PERSON] Over [PERSON] The [PERSON] Channel did not air Justice with [PERSON] Pirro on [PERSON] night.82 Glitchy [ORGANIZATION] Tied to [ORGANIZATION], Widely Used in [ORGANIZATION] A reported glitch in the software of [ORGANIZATION] equipment saw 6,000 votes switched from Republican to Democrat in [LOCATION], [LOCATION] on [ORGANIZATION]. The county clerk caught the issue and it has reportedly been corrected. Similar glitches with the software were reported in [PERSON]. The county clerk PERSON8 came forward and said tabulating software glitched and caused a miscalculation of the votes, [LOCATION] ORG5 chair [ORGANIZATION] said. [LOCATION] had to hand-count all of the ballots. And all these counties that use this software need to closely examine their results for similar discrepancies. The [PERSON]-based companys ORG10 Democracy Suite 5.5 software was used in 69 counties in [LOCATION] on [ORGANIZATION].84 In 30 States, A Computer System Known to be [ORGANIZATION] is Tallying Votes85 Update 1100ET Further down the Domminion Voting System rabbit-hole, ORG6 reports that a technology glitch that halted voting in two [PERSON] counties on [ORGANIZATION] [TIME] was caused by a vendor uploading an update to their election machines [TIME] before, a county election supervisor said. Voters were unable to cast machine ballots for [TIME] in [LOCATION] and [PERSON]0 counties after the electronic devices crashed, state officials said. In response to the delays, ORG7 Judge [PERSON] extended voting until [TIME] The counties use voting machines made by [ORGANIZATION] and electronic poll books  used to sign in voters  made by ORG9. Neither ORG10 nor ORG9 responded to a request to comment. A spokesperson for the secretary of states office also did not respond to follow-up questions about who uploaded the dataset and whether it had been reviewed and tested by anyone beforehand. As GPE0n Thinkers PERSON11 detailed earlier, when PERSON12 heard about the glitchy computer program in [LOCATION], [LOCATION], the one that tried to give 6,000 [PERSON] votes to [ORGANIZATION], he starting doing research into the system. He ended up finding an amazing amount of highly disturbing information. The ORG10 system has been known for some time to be defective, yet 28 states use it.

It involved a large-scale repression of wealthy peasants kulaks genocidal acts against ethnic minorities a purge of ORG13, government officials, and the ORG14 leadership widespread police surveillance suspicion of saboteurs counter-revolutionaries imprisonment and arbitrary executions. Historians estimate the total number of deaths due to PERSON18ist repression in DATE10 to be between 680,000 and 1,200,000. A list from the Great Purge signed by PERSON18, PERSON19, [PERSON]0, [PERSON]1, [PERSON]2, and [PERSON]3. The term repression was officially used to describe the prosecution of people considered counter-revolutionaries and enemies of the people by the leader of [PERSON]2 at the time, [PERSON] PERSON18.

He just came out to say that [ORGANIZATION] is rushing to falsely pose as winner. The networks are trying to push the narrative that [PERSON] is president because theyre saying [ORGANIZATION] won [PERSON]5 but there are still many unanswered questions about voter fraud. ORG18 Justice [ORGANIZATION]0 has also ordered any and all ballot received in [PERSON]5 after polls closed to be segregated PERSON82l county boards of election are hereby ordered, pending further order of the ORG19, to comply with the following guidance provided by the Secretary of [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON], namely, 1 that all ballots received by mail after [TIME] on DATE[ORGANIZATION]6 be segregated and kept in a secure, safe and sealed container separate from other voted ballots, and 2 that all such ballots, if counted, be counted separately.102 Recounts and Canvasses Are Unlikely to Reverse Contaminated Vote Republicans Must Seek Relief in State Legislatures103 The only relief that can be sought by the President and Republican candidates in the swing states that will realistically hand the presidency to the legitimate election winner, President [PERSON], will be in the state legislatures.104 Report GPE[ORGANIZATION]6 Election Clerks May Have Illegally PERSON82tered Thousands of Ballots105 Poll workers in GPE[ORGANIZATION]6 may have unlawfully altered thousands of mail-in ballots due to unlawful guidance from the states election commission, according to a report.106 Report GPE[ORGANIZATION]6 Election Clerks Tampered With Thousands of Ballots107 Poll workers handling absentee ballots in GPE[ORGANIZATION]6 received direction from election authorities to illegally alter ballots with missing information. The missing information  by law  made those absentee ballots invalid and ineligible to be included in tabulation. But a report coming out of GPE[ORGANIZATION]6 reveals that poll workers and ballot counters were given instruction by the GPE[ORGANIZATION]6 Elections Commission ORG21 to write in missing absentee ballot witness information on ballots that were missing that information. GPE[ORGANIZATION]6 law mandates that an absentee ballot requires a signature from a witness who also lists his or her address. This is to prevent voter fraud. Should a ballot not contain this witness information  including the witnesses address, the ballot is disallowed. It must be returned to the voter so that the witness can provide the required information or be rendered a spoiled ballot and excluded from tabulations.108 [ORGANIZATION]1 Democrats Have Been Stealing Votes for DATE[ORGANIZATION]7 Former GPE[ORGANIZATION]7 Governor [ORGANIZATION]1 comments on the contested results across several key states in the presidential election match-up between President [PERSON] and Democratic nominee [PERSON], and the schemes he believes are going on at voting sites.  with ORG22 TVs [ORGANIZATION]2 [PERSON]s [ORGANIZATION] Declaration is a Naked Attempt to Silence Republicans, And [ORGANIZATION] Nothing has changed since [PERSON] night. You might find that strange, given the media stampede to certify the election results for their man, but its crucial. The calls made [PERSON] [TIME] are as arbitrary as they were last [ORGANIZATION], could just as easily have waited for DATE20, and fly in the face of massive evidence of voter irregularities that, at minimum, should be heard in [STREET] before anyone considers calling the election. Add pending lawsuits and official recounts in [PERSON]5, [PERSON], [PERSON]8, [PERSON]9, [LOCATION] and GPE[ORGANIZATION]6, and the conclusion is an attempt by the GPE0n media to pick our president and decide our election. The danger comes now, when in concert with LOC3 censors they use their own decree to dismiss and silence anyone who says otherwise.112 The GPE0n People Deserve Explanations for These Election Anomalies113 The big news networks seem to be pretending that they arent there, but the truth is that there are some very serious statistical anomalies that really need to be explained. The integrity of our elections is of the utmost importance, and over [TIME] I have seen some things that concern me greatly. I think that the mainstream media is assuming that they can just go ahead and declare victory for [PERSON] and that all of these anomalies will soon be forgotten, but I dont think that [PERSON] and his supporters will let this go. The stakes in this election are so high, and it wont be so easy to sweep things under the rug like we have seen in the aftermath of past elections.114 The [ORGANIZATION]3 Election Finding a [STREET] Out of the Maze115 Various irregularities have been reported in five big cities, all in strategic states, and particularly in [LOCATION], Mich. GPE20, GPE21 [LOCATION], [LOCATION] GPE23, GPE24 and GPE25, [LOCATION] The allegations range from mysterious ballot drops that seem to show tens of thousands of votes for [PERSON] and zero votes for President [PERSON], inexplicable record turnouts in late-counting counties all Democrat-dominated that far surpass turnouts in counties in other states where the votes were counted on a timely basis and of course the illegal banning of election observers in those very counties where the most outrageous anomalies are reported. Democrats tell us that there is nothing to see here, and the compliant media dutifully moves along, unwilling to investigate on its own or even express any concern about potential wrongdoing. Even [PERSON] has turned into a lapdog for ORG23, calling [PERSON]8 for [PERSON] long before anyone could know for sure which [STREET] the state would turn. On [TIME], as GPE26 was just about to swing [PERSON] into the [ORGANIZATION] column, ORG24 [ORGANIZATION]4 arrogantly lectured [PERSON] Guess what, Mr. President? Were gonna count the votes, and if they favor you, were gonna show that. And if they dont, were gonna show that. Thats how democracy works. Were just counting the votes. Um, no, thats not the [STREET] it works. News channels dont count a damn thing. They just report numbers shipped out by election offices in various counties across the country, and if ORG25 or any other news outfit were actually doing their jobs, they would be alert for patterns suggesting fraud in the numbers they report. If just counting the votes were all that it took to have a democracy, then [ORGANIZATION]5 GPE27 would be a glorious example of democracy, as would GPE28 So that brings us to the constitutional solution. This one is more elegant, but it still requires a heady dose of chutzpah. As noted, under Article II of the [PERSON]4 Constitution, the state legislatures are solely responsible for determining how each states electors are appointed. If a legislature were convinced that the presidential election in that state was tainted, it could convene and pass an emergency resolution declaring the election null and void and then choose to appoint a slate of electors by [ORGANIZATION]. Since the claim of misconduct is being made by Republicans against Democrats, you can assume that it would take Republican-controlled legislatures to make such a bold move. Fortuitously, Republicans do control both houses of the legislature in [LOCATION], [PERSON]5, GPE[ORGANIZATION]6, [PERSON] and [PERSON]8. [PERSON]9 alone among the contested states has a Democratic legislature. If legislators are convinced that the presidency has been wrested out of Republican hands through chicanery or corruption, they could set the matter right by exercising their constitutional prerogative. This is a heavy lift also, but if states intend to ever exercise their authority under our federal system of government, there would be no more appropriate time to do so than when one party seeks to arrogate unto itself power that it has not earned through a free and fair election. The republic is at stake, and thats not just a nightmare. Its reality.1[ORGANIZATION]6 Top [PERSON]5 Republicans Urge Gov. [ORGANIZATION]6 to Immediately Audit Election1[ORGANIZATION]7 Top Republicans in the [PERSON]5 Legislature called on Gov. Tom [ORGANIZATION]6 D [PERSON] to carry out an immediate audit of the [DATE] elections.118 [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION] in 28 States With Glitch That Flipped 6,000 Votes to PERSON[PERSON]19 ORG27 candidate [PERSON] declared himself winner on [PERSON] based on incomplete results in [PERSON]5, site of an ongoing legal battle over the validity of postal votes received after DATE22. GPE29 President [PERSON]s campaign attorney has demanded recounts in every state using the software that wrongly gave 6,000 votes to Democrats in one [LOCATION] county. PERSON40 comments to [PERSON] on [PERSON] followed revelations that the [ORGANIZATION] vote-tallying machine software that erroneously flipped [LOCATION] in [LOCATION] from the Republicans was being used in at least 28 states  including the key swing states where the result is being contested. Those states include [PERSON]8, [PERSON], [PERSON]9, [LOCATION], [PERSON], [PERSON]9 and [PERSON]5, all key swing states. Democratic party challenger [PERSON] is leading the count in [PERSON]8, [PERSON], [PERSON]9 and [PERSON]5 by wafer-thin margins of between 7,000 and 35,000. DATE23 it emerged that the ORG10 software crashed voting machines in [PERSON]s [PERSON]0 and [LOCATION] counties crashed for [TIME] on DATE24 after the company uploaded an update to them [TIME] before. [PERSON]0 County election supervisor PERSON41 said the firm uploaded something [TIME], which is not normal, and it caused a glitch.120 [PERSON] Says Election Far From Over [ORGANIZATION] Honored amp38 Humbled After [PERSON] Him President-Elect121 The mainstream media has launched a coordinated effort to proclaim [PERSON] President-Elect. President [PERSON] and his campaign team have reminded GPE0ns that legal votes decide who is president, not the news media. As Constitutional lawyer, PERSON42 explains [PERSON] is not the president-elect just because media declares him so. [ORGANIZATION] coordinated efforts are attempting to simply declare [PERSON] the president and ignore the rule of law. There is no official winner until every legal vote is counted accurately, the states certify results, and all legal challenges are resolved. As a reminder, here are the official dates that matter as opposed to what ORG25 et al. think. DATE25 States are expected to resolve controversies [DATE] before the meeting of electors. DATE27 Electors meet in respective states to certify their votes for President and Vice President. As [PERSON] said earlier, this election is far from over.122 Two Statistical Curiosities That PERSON82lowed [ORGANIZATION] to Pull Ahead in GPE33 Please Share123 Update With PERSON43 Law Criticism A brief note.

That is, these are all late vote counts. They start, county by county, where the vote left off on [TIME].

In a chain of events similar to those that have played out around the country, with roughly 85 of votes reported as being tallied, Republican challenger PERSON49, as well as President [PERSON], led their respective races in [ORGANIZATION] by a wide margin, only to see those leads evaporate [ORGANIZATION]2 following the ballots apparent discovery.128 Wait [TIME]! Some Very Good News May be Coming129 This thing is not only not over it is scary for [ORGANIZATION].130 Watch [ORGANIZATION] Supporters Scream [PERSON]! at [PERSON]1 [PERSON] Supporters Singing National Anthem1[PERSON] A group of [PERSON] D supporters screamed obscenities at President [PERSON] supporters while they sang the National Anthem on [PERSON] in [LOCATION], [PERSON]1.132 Why We Stand With President PERSON1[PERSON]33 The fight over [ORGANIZATION]s election is existential. Its about liberty versus tyranny  in some form and degree.134 GPE[ORGANIZATION]6 Clerks May Have Unlawfully PERSON82tered Thousands of Absentee Ballots135 County and municipal clerks and poll workers across GPE[ORGANIZATION]6 may have unlawfully altered witness statements on thousands of mail-in ballots across the state, [ORGANIZATION] has learned. GPE[ORGANIZATION]6 Statute 6.86 provides that an absentee ballot must be signed by a witness, who is also required to list his or her address. If a witness address is not listed, then the ballot is considered invalid and must be returned to the voter to have the witness correct. Instead, multiple sources tell [ORGANIZATION], municipal clerks and vote counters across the state simply filled out witness signatures themselves. Acting on false and unlawful advice from the GPE[ORGANIZATION]6 Elections Commission ORG21, these clerks may have inadvertently invalidated thousands of absentee votes. The statute is very, very clear, said retired GPE[ORGANIZATION]6 ORG18 Justice [PERSON]0, who worked as a poll watcher in GPE23 on [ORGANIZATION]4. If an absentee ballot does not have a witness address on it, its not valid. That ballot is not valid.136 Bad Start Anti-Brexit [ORGANIZATION] Declines Comment to British [ORGANIZATION]  [PERSON]1? I[PERSON]1 British-GPE0n relations under a potential [ORGANIZATION] presidency are off to a bad start, with the [ORGANIZATION]5 Democrat declining to give comment to the British press, saying [PERSON]1? Im Irish. Vote counting in the [PERSON]4 continues in some areas and results have not been officially certified, with President [PERSON] alleging fraud and declining to concede  yet much of the mainstream media have declared Mr [ORGANIZATION] the winner or at least the projected winner of the election regardless.138 Belgian Police Arrest 2 Minors Suspected of Plotting Attack139 BRGPE29SELS  The office of [LOCATION] federal prosecutor says two underage people suspected of plotting what it called a terror attack have been arrested. Aged [ORGANIZATION]6 and [ORGANIZATION]7, they were arrested on Oct. [PERSON] following raids in the cities of [LOCATION]1 and [LOCATION]2, located in the province of [LOCATION]3. The prosecutors office said they are suspected of attempted terrorist assassination and participation in a terrorist organization. The two minors have been placed in a youth protection center. According to Belgian broadcaster [PERSON]2, the two suspects had recorded a video of allegiance to the [PERSON]3 group and are suspected of planning a stabbing attack against police officers.140 Dutch Teacher Who Posted [ORGANIZATION] by Threats141 A Dutch teacher in the city of [LOCATION]4 was allegedly forced to go into hiding after receiving threats when he posted a picture of a cartoon mocking jihadists. The teacher is said to have received various threats after posting a cartoon of a decapitated man with a [PERSON]4 t-shirt sticking is tongue out at a jihadist with a bloody sword.142 [ORGANIZATION] ORG52ic Terrorism Has Never Disappeared From [PERSON]143 According to intelligence services, the threat of terrorist attacks in [PERSON] is long-term. Radical ORG52ism has not disappeared in [ORGANIZATION]9, but most attacks have not become known to the wide public due to the low number of victims. Rather than extensive attacks, the current problem is the terrorist acts of individuals that are difficult to predict. The murder of the teacher in [LOCATION]5, the massacre in the church in [LOCATION]6, and the terrorist attack in the center of [LOCATION]7 on DATE20 are just a few examples of attacks in DATE40. Besides them, there were several other incidents, which have since been forgotten, such as the machete attack in [LOCATION]8 or violence and murders in the French suburbs.144 [PERSON]2 and PERSON82lies [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION] Areas145 Populist Senator [PERSON]3 League, along with their allies [PERSON]5, has called on the Italian government to suspend taxes in areas under lockdown to save local businesses. The two parties have called on the left-wing coalition government of Prime Minister [PERSON]4 to freeze tax collection in areas declared as red zones, which are seeing the strictest lockdown measures enacted to stop the spread of the [LOCATION] virus.146 The [PERSON]an Commissions Forecast The Drop in the Czech Economy to be Lower Than Expected147 According to the [PERSON]an Commission, the Czech economy is expected to drop by 6.9 percent DATE41 due to the coronavirus crisis, which is an improvement compared to previous estimates. In its macroeconomic forecast, on the other hand, the [PERSON]8 worsened the prospects for the recovery of the Czech economy DATE42, when gross domestic product is expected to increase by only 3.1 percent. This is 1.4 percentage points less than in its DATE43 forecast. The slower economic recovery is related to the second wave of the pandemic due to which [PERSON]9, as in DATE44, had to enact measures that led to a significant reduction in economic activity, the [PERSON]8 reasoned.148 [LOCATION]9 [PERSON]6s Legacy Considered for Review by ORG40 After ORG42149 The legacy of [LOCATION]1s wartime leader, Sir [PERSON]5, is reported to have been under review at the ORG40, in the latest blow against British history amid the iconoclastic ORG42 unrest. [PERSON]6 has long been a target of ire for the radical leftist movement, which has accused the man credited with defeating Nazi [LOCATION]0 of being racist and a colonialist.150 [LOCATION]9 Man Jailed for Running Over DATE45, Slashing DATE46 Neck, Stabbing Old Man and Young Mother151 A DATE47 man received a life sentence for a string of gruesome attacks which saw him run over a DATE48, slash the throat of a DATE49 boy, and stab a mother walking with her children and a man in his DATE50 in the head. [PERSON]7 was convicted of four counts of attempted murder for his attacks, perpetrated on four separate occasions, at [ORGANIZATION], along with three counts of possession of a bladed article, according to an official ORG44 news bulletin.152 [LOCATION]9 Pics Queen, DATE51, [ORGANIZATION] Warrior153 Queen [PERSON]8 left isolation to lay flowers at [PERSON], as [LOCATION]1 attempts to commemorate the fallen despite the coronavirus lockdown. [LOCATION]1s DATE51-year-old monarch, the only [PERSON]an head of state to have seen some service in the Second World War, training as a driver and mechanic in ORG45, has been following government instructions to shield since it began regulating against the pandemic, making few public appearances  but was unwilling to sit out the countrys DATE53 commemorations for the glorious dead.154 Why is it Right to Question the Orthodox [ORGANIZATION] Narrative?155 So, how do we go about evaluating the effectiveness of lockdowns? Where is the evidence that the virus ultimately causes far more deaths in the absence of extreme social restrictions? Where are those countries that followed a different course from countries like the [LOCATION]9 which locked down, but did not suppress the virus and now have higher death tolls than us? By simply assuming that his counterfactual claim is true, [PERSON]9 illustrates our worry that lockdowns risk becoming an unfalsifiable article of faith. In fact, he even asserts that the science on this is beyond question. Is it really? If so, all the disease modelers who have made dire predictions concerning the current [LOCATION]9 situation will be delighted to hear that their work will be forever immune from critique, even if it turns out that their models have little bearing on reality. And, in any case, none of them would endorse [PERSON]9s exaggerated claim that, without a lockdown, there would have been many millions of deaths in countries such as the [LOCATION]9.In fact, much about the behaviour of this virus remains unclear, including how the infection rate is influenced by growing immunity within a population. There is no single, homogeneous entity called the science. Rather, there are many different and often conflicting perspectives, theories, and claims. Furthermore, this is a complicated, fast-changing situation that impacts on all aspects of human society. Relevant expertise thus encompasses a wide range of academic disciplines and areas of practice. Philosophers should not simply defer to the experts they also have plenty of relevant expertise themselves. What we do know is that lockdowns are immensely damaging in so many ways. This second [LOCATION]9 lockdown will further disrupt the social and emotional development of our children, cause a substantial rise in severe mental health problems, force many elderly people to live out DATE54 and perhaps DATE55 of their lives in loneliness and misery, exacerbate and prolong the pain of bereavement by depriving people of interpersonal and social interactions that shape and regulate grief, destroy livelihoods and risk mass unemployment, increase regional social and economic inequalities, reduce the life-opportunities of young people while saddling them with an ever-growing mountain of debt to pay off, suspend much of what gives our lives meaning, deprive people of countless precious, irreplaceable life-moments, and cause deaths due to the numerous resulting impacts on peoples health. However, the true extent of certain harms, such as the long-term effects of sustained lockdown measures on childrens development, may not become fully clear for some time.156 With [LOCATION]2 Under Threat, PM PERSON60 Implies Possible Veto of DATE56 Budget in Letter to ORG47 Leaders157 Hungarian Prime Minister [PERSON] PERSON60 is ready to veto the ORG47 budget and the recovery fund if the payment of funds to individual member states is subject to the rule of law, according to a report from ORG48. [LOCATION]2s veto threat comes after the German presidency of the [ORGANIZATION] of the [PERSON]an Union and the negotiators of the [PERSON]an [ORGANIZATION] reached an agreement on the conditionality of ORG47 funds, which both the conservative governments of [LOCATION]2 and [LOCATION]4 believe is a serious threat. According to the draft, if the [PERSON]an Commission detects a breach of the rule of law or a risk thereof in a member state, it can launch the initiation of a sanction mechanism. The sanctions would be decided by the [PERSON]an [ORGANIZATION] by a qualified majority vote, and thus on the possible suspension of ORG47 funds. In such a scenario, [LOCATION]2 and [LOCATION]4 would be unable to veto the sanctions.158 PERSON63 Jihad on Infidel [PERSON]159 The jihad against [PERSON] by Turkish President PERSON62 is probably based on both ideology and opportunism. Fierce anti-Western rhetoric is an ideological sine qua non for Turkish political ORG52 it is also a secure vote-catcher targeting conservative and nationalist masses. PERSON63 jihadism is not seasonal or a newfound system of political ideas. It is also not a reflection of peaceful sufism. PERSON64 comes from the ranks of [LOCATION]5s militant political ORG52ism that emerged in DATE57 under the leadership of the ideologue, PERSON65, [LOCATION]5s first ORG52ist prime minister and PERSON63 mentor. In Erbakans rhetoric universal politics is simply about a struggle between the righteous ORG52 and a coalition of Zionists and racist imperialists  all else is just details. In his thinking, the Zionists support [LOCATION]5s membership in the [PERSON]an Union in order to get Turkish Muslims to melt in a pot of Christianity. In a 20[ORGANIZATION]6 speech, PERSON64 talked of [PERSON]an countries These are not just our enemies Behind them are plans and plots and other powers. PERSON82so in 20[ORGANIZATION]6, he said that jihad is never terrorism. It is resurrection It is to give life, to build It is to fight the enemies of ORG52. In 20[ORGANIZATION]7, PERSON64 added that the German governments actions resembled those of Nazi [LOCATION]0.[ORGANIZATION]60 [LOCATION]5 The Return of Demons[ORGANIZATION]61 Our past was in [PERSON] but our future is in [PERSON]! This was how PERSON67 portrayed his vision for [LOCATION]5 in a panel debate in [LOCATION]6 in DATE60. At the time, PERSON68, who died DATE61 at DATE62, was one of the rising stars of Turkish politics and a generation that seemed destined to complete a revolution that had started in DATE63 in [LOCATION]7. That revolution had aimed at transforming the moribund empire into a modern Western-style state capable of reversing DATE64 of decline that had earned the caliphate the sobriquet of [ORGANIZATION] man of [PERSON]. By DATE65, however, it had become clear that building a modern [PERSON]an-style state, based on the [PERSON] principles, required the existence of a nation also in the [PERSON]an sense of the term an impossible task as long as the Ottoman state remained a multi-national empire whose legitimacy was based on religion which, by definition, excludes the very concept of a nation-state.[ORGANIZATION]62 [LOCATION]8 Killed Because She Refused to [PERSON] and [PERSON] PERSON69 House Seek Death Penalty for Her Murderer PERSON73[ORGANIZATION]63 DATE66 Hindu girl PERSON71 was shot dead by one PERSON72, who belongs to an influential family of [LOCATION] politicians, in broad daylight outside her college on DATE67 DATE20, allegedly after she refused his proposal for marriage. The family of the deceased, seeking justice for their young daughter who was brutally murdered by PERSON73, have now put up posters outside their house stating PERSON72s motive behind the murder and seeking justice for their daughters brutal killing. According to the report by [ORGANIZATION] journalist PERSON75, the family who has been mourning the untimely death of their daughter, have put up two large posters on the entrance of the house. One reads PERSON76 sharminda hain tere [PERSON] hain. [LOCATION]9 sarkar hosh mein aao. [PERSON] faarsi do. [LOCATION]8 wants justice for PERSON71 Dear, we are ashamed that your killers are still alive. Come to senses, [LOCATION]9 government. Hang the killers.

HaHa, tweeted ORG57, the largest state-owned newspaper in [LOCATION]0. Two laughing emoji were also included in the message.[ORGANIZATION]66 Study Offers More Proof That UV Light Kills Coronavirus[ORGANIZATION]67 Regular UV light is widely used to eliminate germs on surfaces, but has a wavelength of 254 nanometers, an intense UV exposure which scientists say can actually penetrate the human body. However, a team at ORG58 found Ultraviolet C light with a wavelength of 222 nanometers offers a safer but still effective [STREET] to kill [LOCATION]6RS-CoV-2, the virus causing [ORGANIZATION], without harming human cells. While 254-nm light can break through the outer layer of dead cells on the skin and eyes, irradiating human tissue, the Far-UVC light cannot penetrate human skin or eyes. Not only that, but after [TIME] of exposure, researchers discovered 222-nm light kills 99.7 of the virus. The findings offer hospitals safer ways to sterilize work areas while keeping staff and patients out of danger.[ORGANIZATION]68 [ORGANIZATION]-Up Southerners Fleeing COVID-Hit [LOCATION]1 and [LOCATION]2 Are Moving to Coastal [LOCATION]3 and Pricing Out Locals  With Some Ending Up Sleeping in Tents[ORGANIZATION]69 The [ORGANIZATION] pandemic saw an influx of southerners making the move north, driving rental prices up and availability down to next to nothing.[ORGANIZATION]70 The Job No [LOCATION]7n Wants Furious Farmers Question Why Dole Bludgers Are Choosing to Take Government Handouts Instead of [ORGANIZATION] in on 6k Relocation Incentive[ORGANIZATION]71 Farmers in parts of [LOCATION]3, [LOCATION]4, [LOCATION]5 and [LOCATION]6 claim they have to plough their bumper crops into the ground due to a critical shortage of fruit pickers in the peak season.[ORGANIZATION]72 The Real Cost of [LOCATION] [LOCATION]7 Faces a Mental Health Crisis With Young Women Most at Risk After Thousands Were Left Unemployed[ORGANIZATION]73 As [ORGANIZATION] cases continue to dwindle, Professor PERSON78 cited predictions from more recent scientific models that [LOCATION]7 would face a second curve of mental ill-health and suicide.[ORGANIZATION]74 Mexican President Imprudent to Congratulate [ORGANIZATION] Before Elections Legal Issues Resolved[ORGANIZATION]75 [LOCATION]8 President said it is too early to congratulate any of the [PERSON]4 presidential candidates since the elections still have several pending legal issues. In an effort to be respectful to the process, he will wait until all legal matters are resolved before congratulating the winner.[ORGANIZATION]76 [PERSON] Who Brutally Beat DATE69 Nun in [LOCATION]9 is Arrested by Police[ORGANIZATION]77 [LOCATION]9n police have arrested an Afghan migrant who brutally beat a [PERSON]0 Catholic nun in the multicultural city of [PERSON]0. The assault is only the latest in spate of [PERSON] attacks to take [STREET] across Western [PERSON] in [PERSON]1. The [PERSON]2 migrant attacker, who was known to authorities for previous drug and assault offenses, hit the elderly nun in the face, knocking her to the floor, as she traveled on the bus with another religious sister on [PERSON] afternoon. Shortly after, the perpetrator fled the scene. [LOCATION]9n newspaper ORG59 reports. After reviewing captured video footage from the bus, ORG60 and [PERSON] promptly identified the Afghan-born assailant and arrested him. Shortly after his arrest, upon being interrogated by police, the Afghan migrant confessed to the crime. According to police, the motive for the attack is still unclear.[ORGANIZATION]78 LOC8 See 1,600 Migrants Arrive Over DATE6[ORGANIZATION]79 More than 1,600 African migrants have been rescued at sea or reached Spains LOC8 over [PERSON]3, Spanish emergency services said. About 1,000 arrived on [PERSON] alone, setting out on about 20 barely seaworthy boats. One person was flown to hospital by helicopter.180 Czech ORG61 Officers Detain a Turkish Truck With Dozens of Migrants181 On [TIME], Czech customs officers stopped a truck transporting 48 migrants in LOC10 after an X-ray detected people in the semi-trailer. ORG61 spokeswoman PERSON79 said that this was a usual inspection in which customs officers on the D2 highway stopped and inspected a tractor with a semi-trailer. It had a Turkish license plate. There were two drivers inside, and according to the documents, they were supposed to be transporting tiles, said the spokeswoman. However, a large-object X-ray by the customs officers revealed people inside the trailer. The customs officers thus made the truck park near the small town of [PERSON]1, and [TIME], people gradually started coming out of it with the assistance of police officers. They are young men and one woman there is no child among them. They said they were from [PERSON]2 and headed for [LOCATION]0, the spokeswoman added.182 [LOCATION]0 Mayor [PERSON] on Right-Wingers That Was Actually Committed by Muslim Migrants183 Here is the disconnect between the establishment narrative regarding the right-wing threat and ORG52ophobia on the one hand, and reality on the other.

Seven men and one woman were seen huddled in a dinghy before they were picked up and taken to [PERSON]3 by ORG64 on [PERSON]. ORG65 said 56 people made the crossing on DATE21, while a further 40 arrived on [PERSON].186 [LOCATION]9 Migration Watch Number of Freed Foreign Criminals Has Doubled Since [PERSON]6 A report from a mass migration sceptic think tank has revealed that the number of convicted foreign criminals freed to roam the streets of [LOCATION]1 has doubled since [PERSON]7, and warned that the increase poses a growing risk to families. The Migration Watch [LOCATION]9 analysis found that some 9,400 foreign national offenders FNOs are living free in communities across [PERSON]4, up from [DATE] in [PERSON]7.188 Information War? Internet Archive to Rewrite History With PERSON82erts for Fact-CheckedSites189 According to an [ORGANIZATION] blog post, you will now know if a page was pulled down or received an alert over what fact-checkers consider misinformation. This also includes dead web pages that were archived. ORG67 has started adding fact checks and context to [ORGANIZATION] pages to explain just why the pages were removed. If a page was part of a disinformation campaign or pulled due to a policy violation, a distinct yellow banner will explain why. The fact checks will come from a variety of mainstream outlets, including [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION], ORG70, and ORG71. Which absolutely in no [STREET] will be manipulated, right? Of course, thats obvious sarcasm, as those controlling what is and isnt disinformation will be the wolves guarding the hen house so to speak. A good question to ask is how does [ORGANIZATION] treat verifiable information like the PERSON81 administration lying about WMDs, the PERSON82-PERSON83 testimony lie that almost sunk us into a war with [PERSON]5 or the validated conspiratorial facts surrounding [PERSON]8, like the hijackers being given [LOCATION] from the [PERSON]6 consulate, as documented by PERSON84, who worked as the Head of [ORGANIZATION] at the ORG73 consulate in [PERSON]7, [PERSON]6. [ORGANIZATION] are continuouslt rewriting history everywhere. [PERSON] [PERSON]9 has come to life.190 [ORGANIZATION] A Surrender?191 The Popes Encyclical [ORGANIZATION] PERSON82l sadly seems more a massive and unwieldy political document than a religious guide to the Catholic faithful. The encyclicals intended audience appears to be secular world rather than people of faith. The 43,000-word tome contains almost no discussion of Catholic dogmas. PERSON82though the Pontiffs diagnosis of the worlds ills seems accurate enough, unfortunately his proposed antidotes  equality of result rather than equality of opportunity and individual liberty, the bedrocks of Western democracies  would seriously threaten freedom. The Pope, for instance, implies that the twilight of the planets DATE80 old diplomatic nation-state system has arrived, prompting the need for a more globalist political system. Regrettably, that usually brings with it no transparency, no accountability and no recourse.

PERSON[DATE], the leader of the newly formed [PERSON]9, has been excluded for not meeting the debate criteria the elites set down. If nothing else, PERSON44 exclusion illustrates how much Canadian voters, real ordinary people, dont matter. [ORGANIZATION]0 has been around since [ORGANIZATION]7 and currently has about 18,000 members. The [ORGANIZATION]1 on the other hand, created in [LOCATION], has 40,000 members. That doesnt matter. PERSON45 should not be worried about being excluded from what is obviously a rigged debate. And [ORGANIZATION]2 leader PERSON46 should think twice before wanting to participate. As far as the English language debate is concerned, the presence of the [ORGANIZATION]3 is irrelevant. It was a given that in the debate, PERSON47, PERSON48 and PERSON49 would all be ganging up on PERSON50 who has a good chance of forming the next government. PERSON48 and PERSON49 have zero chance of governing but would have power if the Liberals wound up with a minority government and needed the help of one or both of the [PERSON]6 and [PERSON]7. [PERSON] PERSON49 could end up as the adult in the room and it would be fun to watch her interactions with [PERSON].

He will talk to the ORG63 and the [ORGANIZATION]9 separately on [ORGANIZATION] and if they both come out in favour of a longORG32term government he may give the green light to a premierORG32designate to explore that possibility. [PERSON]2 laid down five points to discuss with the [ORGANIZATION]9 loyal membership of ORGDATE[DATE] full recognition of representative democracy, starting from the central role of parliament development based on environmental sustainability, a change in the management of migrant flows, with [PERSON] as a full protagonist and a turning point on economic and social recipes, in a redistributive line, which will open [ORGANIZATION]8 of investments. It is uncertain whether the [ORGANIZATION]9 will accept these terms. The ORG63 directorate gave [PERSON]2 a mandate to open talks to verify the possibility of a turningORG32point government for the legislative term, marking discontinuity with the [ORGANIZATION]9ORG32ORG60 government. The motion granting the mandate was approved unanimously. [PERSON]2 said I have never demonised the [ORGANIZATION]9, but we must recognise that there are profound differences with them. The ORG63 leader said he could rule out any under the table stitchORG32ups or shady deals to cobble together a shortORG32term government. He also said the ORG63 was united and would go to see [PERSON]5 all together to verify the conditions for a new turning point government, useful to the country. [PERSON]2 ruled out the idea of the ORG63 backing a second government led by [PERSON]7. Discontinuity means that obviously we dont want to and cant join a government that proposes a [PERSON]7 2, the continuation of a government that we fought, he said. Everyone should get behind the need to start a new government. [PERSON]2 added with respect to a government that went into crisis, we must give life to a new government that is a new team, but united on the programme. Asked if he might be premier of this possible new government with the [ORGANIZATION]9, he said he already had two weighty jobs to do, as ORG63 leader and GPE29 governor. The [ORGANIZATION]9, for its part, said [ORGANIZATION] it was the top party in parliament, with the most seats gained in the DATE41 general election, and would speak about possible ways forward towards either a new government or a general election after President [PERSON]5 concludes his consultations with political parties [ORGANIZATION] [TIME]. Following the crisis opened by [PERSON]0, the [ORGANIZATION]9 said in a statement, the [ORGANIZATION]9 deems it opportune in this highly delicate phase to await the outcome of the consultations which head of ORG67 PERSONDATE[DATE] will lead. In [TIME] we are receiving appeals from many sides and the [ORGANIZATION]9 takes the opportunity to remind all political forces that it is the top party in parliament, with a relative majority.

Over 70 percent of the legal objections are based on species conservation, especially the threat to endangered bird species and bats, a growing concern around the world. Besides species protection, 17 percent of legal cases deal with noise protection. Another 6 percent of lawsuits deal with monument protection. The German government also forced the wind power industry to cut costs, introducing a marketORG32based tendering model. The economic and legal risks have made investors leery about investing in wind projects without the massive governmentORG32mandated subsidies that the wind industry enjoyed.

Consider, for instance, extremists desecrating and destroying Christian cemeteries and their crosses. While the act itself is largely symbolic  in that no living person gets hurt  it is also reflective of a committed hatred that transcends, say, responding to a physical threat. While the persecution of a Christian can be motivated by particular circumstances  conflicts, sexual attraction, convenience, gain, and so on  attacks on inanimate symbols would seem to reflect a hatred for ORG87 and its followers that needs no reason and seemingly gains nothing.

While speaking with reporters on [ORGANIZATION], PERSON12 said his administration was reviewing an executive order to end the ridiculous birthright citizenship policy. Were looking at that very seriously  birthright citizenship. Where you have a baby on our land, you walk over the border, have a baby, congratulations the baby is now a GPE62 citizen, PERSON12 said. Were looking at it very, very seriously. We are looking at birthright citizenship very seriously, PERSON12 continued. Its, frankly, ridiculous.

There is nothing necessarily unethical or unreasonable about eating human flesh, declare psychologists PERSON100 and PERSON101 of [ORGANIZATION]18, but careful reasoning over the merits of cannibalism is often overridden by our feelings of repulsion and disgust.

portland,2021-03-01T00:00:00Z,Conservative Daily News,KATU,homelessness,Top 10 Worst Mayors in [ORGANIZATION],"10 - PERSON0, [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], the mayor of the [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] town of [ORGANIZATION], was [PERSON] by [PERSON] officials after being chased by police who were pursing him as part of an undercover investigation. During the chase, the DATE1 PERSON1 threw one gram of crack cocaine out the passengers window of his vehicle. How proud the voters of [ORGANIZATION] must be. PERSON1 was charged with, criminal possession of a controlled substance, tampering with physical evidence and failure to comply with a police officer. So, we have a crack-smoking mayor with no respect for police would anyone be surprised to learn that other mayors on this list were also crack-heads? 9 - PERSON2, [PERSON], GPE4 - In one of the more blatant examples of our mainstream medias leftwing bias and complete stupidity, DATE2 Sen. [PERSON] was being crucified2 in the press for taking a trip to [ORGANIZATION] while residents of his state were reeling from unprecedented [ORGANIZATION] storms and power outages. The press was accusing PERSON4 of hypocrisy similar to that of [PERSON] Mayor PERSON2, who had taken a trip3 to GPE7 in DATE4 amid a surge in [PERSON] infections. PERSON5, who had strongly recommended [PERSON] residents to stay at home during the uptick, took a private jet to GPE8 with seven other people after having hosted a wedding for his daughter with twenty guests. While in GPE7, PERSON5 actually took video of his frolicking at the [PERSON] timeshare. Thats hypocrisy, folks. PERSON4, on the other hand, is a federal legislator with no input on state and local matters who never told folks to stay at home. How is there any comparison? 8 - [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION] a rising star within [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] spoke at [ORGANIZATION], and was even offered4 a spot on President [PERSON]. It all makes sense considering [ORGANIZATION] fits right in with the rest of the party. [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] tried to [PERSON] an unconstitutional mask-mandate due to the [PERSON] pandemic, a move that was blocked by [ORGANIZATION]. Homicides in [ORGANIZATION] to the highest number since DATE8. And her mishandling of riots after the PERSON10 debacle [PERSON] resulted in the death7 of an DATE9 little girl. [ORGANIZATION] has also been fined8 for Campaign Finance violations, a rite of passage for any self-respecting Democrat. Yup, [PERSON] checks all the boxes for Democrats, in fact, she might even be Presidential timber. 7 - PERSON11, [PERSON]1 - [ORGANIZATION] as [PERSON]1s protest known as [ORGANIZATION] raged on, [PERSON] tried desperately to downplay the crisis. [PERSON] described9 the armed protest as more like a block party, and did everything possible to appease the protesters as the situation dragged on. Once it became clear that the protest was highly destructive and deadly - with three people having [ORGANIZATION] and national attention on the rise - [PERSON] tried to regain control, but the damage was done. As a defund the police advocate, and to satisfy those on her radical left, [PERSON] subsequently moved to cut11 the citys police budget by 20 million, but it didnt work. As is usually the case when one tries to placate anarchists, once the smoke cleared everyone was unhappy. [PERSON] successfully fought off a recall effort shortly after the ORG1 disaster, and then had her taxpayers12 foot the bill for her legal expenses. But she has announced13 that she will not seek reelection to another term good choice Mayor [PERSON]. 6 - PERSON14, [LOCATION] - Mayor PERSON15 and [PERSON]3 Governor PERSON16 arent just cut from the same cloth, they appear to be competing for the title of worst government official in [PERSON]3. At the beginning of the [PERSON] pandemic, PERSON15 did his best to set the bar for aspiring government overreach enthusiasts with an idea straight out of a PERSON17 novel. PERSON15 offered14 rewards to citizens who snitch on neighbors violating his [PERSON] at Home policy, and his passion for control hasnt let up. DATE10 after [PERSON] lockdowns began, PERSON15s restrictions continue to [LOCATION] the citys business community. Additionally, homelessness in [LOCATION] has skyrocketed16 in [LOCATION] under PERSON15s leadership, beginning long before the pandemic. But perhaps no action by PERSON15 justifies his inclusion on this list more than this absurd [PERSON] relief idea. In [DATE], PERSON15 announced17 a 20 discount on parking tickets to help lessen the financial impact of the virus, stating In moments of crisis, we need to do all we can to support our citizens. Yup, because in moments of crisis we look for this type of assertive, compassionate leadership. PERSON19, PERSON20, and PERSON14 in no particular order goose bumps. 5 - PERSON21, [PERSON]5 [PERSON] - When a black [PERSON]5 resident named PERSON22 died [PERSON] due to injuries sustained18 while being restrained by police, Mayor PERSON23 did what Democrats do and threw19 her Police Chief under the bus. PERSON23 lied about Chief PERSON24 assessment of PERSON25 death, falsely claiming that PERSON26 had called the death an overdose. Nonetheless, PERSON23 went on to fire PERSON26, and the investigation into PERSON25 death continues. PERSON23 mishandled the aftermath of PERSON25 death, and when a protest turned violent with one serious injury, she demanded that charges be dropped against nine rioters who had been arrested as a result. Police bad, rioters good. For good measure, [PERSON] after the riot, PERSON23 was indicted20 by a federal grand jury on two felony counts of campaign finance violations. With such incompetence and corruption, her political career must be doomed, right? Nope. [PERSON]6 Democrats have designated21 PERSON23 as their candidate for a third term. Perhaps PERSON23 should plead guilty to the criminal charges shed probably win reelection in a landslide. 4 - PERSON27, [LOCATION] - DATE13 after the death of [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION], there is still zero evidence indicating any actions taken by the officers who handled PERSON29 arrest at the time of his death were driven by race including the lone white officer on the scene, PERSON30. It also seems increasingly likely that the case against PERSON31 could fall apart during his trial. Nonetheless, Mayor PERSON27, who shortly after PERSON29 death helped ramp up tensions by [ORGANIZATION], Being black in [PERSON]8 should not be a death sentence, remains defiant. PERSON32 had undoubtedly hoped that such rhetoric would spare him from the very mob he helped urge on, but he was sadly mistaken. PERSON32 was relentlessly jeered23 during a protest in DATE14, to the point he had to be escorted away to safety. You can keep feeding those leftist alligators with nonsense, Mayor PERSON32, but eventually they will come to eat you as well. PERSON32 eventually [ORGANIZATION] to calls for defunding the police, only to backtrack25 DATE15 and add another 6.4 million to the police departments budget. Meanwhile, violent crime in the city increased26 by 21 [PERSON] as PERSON32 was bashing and slashing the cops. So, if you belittle your own police and then take away funding, crime will actually go up? Well, [PERSON] be darned. 3 - PERSON33, [PERSON]9 - Rioting by ORG2 and ORG3 went on for DATE16 in GPE20 DATE17, while PERSON34 was the epitome of [LOCATION]. The middle ground is very elusive right now,said PERSON34, as he tried to simultaneously pacify rioters while keeping his city from burning to the ground an effort that failed miserably. PERSON34 went so far as to join in the protests, which earned him a proper pepper-spraying28 by federal officers defending the GPE21 Courthouse. The rioters eventually turned all of their ire towards PERSON34 himself, bringing the [ORGANIZATION] directly to the doorstep of his house as they demanded his resignation. Not surprisingly, GPE20 saw a 144 increase30 in violence DATE18. What separates [ORGANIZATION] incompetence from those of mayors in other cities stricken by race-driven riots is their persistence. While [PERSON]1, [LOCATION] and [PERSON] saw their riots fizzle out, [ORGANIZATION] riots continued. A riot, in fact, was declared31 on DATE19 in GPE20. Still trying to find that middle ground PERSON36? 2 - PERSON37, [LOCATION] - Upon being elected, the left and their media couldnt contain32 their glee over PERSON38 election. PERSON37 is the first black, openly gay woman to be mayor of [LOCATION], which means she lands in virtually every identity politics category they have. What could go wrong? It never dawned on the left, apparently, that ones skin color, genitalia, and bedroom activities have nothing to do with ones effectiveness. Black, openly gay women can be just as lousy at governance as white, bible-thumping men. Uselessness is nondiscriminatory anyone can be infected with it. After [LOCATION] was pummeled with riots after the death of [ORGANIZATION], and after it was clear that PERSON39 had screwed-the-pooch with her handling of the violence, the mayor explained33, No mayor expected what we all got, and how she hoped the riots wouldnt happen again. Hope is for church, and its your job to expect the unexpected, Mayor PERSON39. Thats why you were elected. During the [PERSON] lockdown in the city, while the rest of [LOCATION]ans were huddled in their living rooms driving each other crazy, PERSON39 was caught going to a beauty salon for a haircut please feel free to insert your own witty comment here about the results 34of that haircut. Was PERSON39 apologetic? Umm, no. The mayor justified her double-standard by explaining35, Im in the public eye DATE20. Its OK for the mayor to violate her own orders, but not you peons. We can also consider the [STREET] in which [ORGANIZATION] walked all over36 PERSON39 in validating her position on this list. But nothing is more indicative of PERSON38 disastrous performance than the violent crime rate that is plaguing her city. Murders in [LOCATION] jumped37 55 [PERSON] compared to DATE21, and that is a heartbreaking statistic. 1 - PERSON40, [PERSON] City - Yes, he bears a striking resemblance to PERSON41 from [LOCATION] yes hes an unrepentant groundhog assassin38 and yes he ran an absolutely laughable campaign for the Democratic Presidential nomination in DATE21. But none of those reasons were part of the formula used to determine his worthiness here. Mayor PERSON40 is an absolutely awful mayor. [ORGANIZATION] DATE22 of the [PERSON] pandemic worse than any other government official in the country, and thousands of [PERSON]ers died as a result. With the pandemic temporarily waning in [DATE] ORG2 protests on city streets, with thousands of unmasked protesters, while keeping the other aspects of his draconian [PERSON] lockdown in [STREET]. Due to PERSON42s clear contempt for his own [INSTITUTION], and a whopping 1 billion41 cut in its funding, violent crime has absolutely soared42 in the city under PERSON43s watch. And millions - yes, literally millions - of city residents have fled43 the city because of PERSON43s utter incompetence. Heres a simple question to illustrate exactly how bad PERSON43 has been can you name one single thing PERSON43 has done well since being mayor? Cue the theme from [LOCATION]. PERSON40 isnt just the worst mayor in [PERSON]8, hes one of the worst mayors in [PERSON]8n history. And again, if were examining the worst mayors, should it be the Top Ten or the Bottom Ten?

By now, vast hordes of unemployed [ORGANIZATION] were supposed to be returning to their old jobs and economic activity was supposed to be returning to normal levels. But it hasnt happened that [STREET]. Instead, the [PERSON] economy continues to unravel at a steady pace. DATE3 more businesses go under, more layoffs are announced and more people get behind on their bills. What we have already been through has been far worse than anything that we experienced during the last recession, and it appears that this new economic downturn is entering yet another new phase. On [PERSON], we learned that another 1.106 million [ORGANIZATION] filed new claims for unemployment benefits [PERSON] The number of people filing for unemployment benefits [PERSON] was greater than expected, raising concern about the state of the economy as lawmakers struggle to move forward on a new pandemic stimulus package. [PERSON] said [PERSON] that initial jobless claims for [ORGANIZATION] came in at 1.106 million. Economists polled by [ORGANIZATION] expected a total of 923,000. Initial claims for [ORGANIZATION] were also revised higher by 8,000 to 971,000. Instead of going down as most analysts were anticipating, the number of initial claims shot [STREET] back above a million. And this means that we have now gotten a number that is above a million for 21 of DATE8. Prior to [ORGANIZATION], the worst DATE9 number in all of [PERSON] history was 695,000. To absolutely dwarf that old record for [LOCATION]0 should be almost theoretically impossible. If you would have asked me [LOCATION]1 what it would take to have the kind of unemployment numbers that we are seeing now, I would have probably suggested that it would take something like a world war or a major asteroid strike to produce such figures. The numbers that we keep getting [LOCATION]2 after [LOCATION]2 are simply absurd, but they just keep coming. Comment This is the goal of globalists feardemic  to destroy western civilization.80 Almost a Million Australians Will be Out of Work for [LOCATION]3 as [PERSON] States to Spend More to Create Jobs81 The Prime Minster said the unemployment rate is expected to hover around seven per cent as the economy recovers from the recession caused by the response to coronavirus.82 ORG6 [ORGANIZATION] Sees Largest Drop in Industrial Production83 Industrial production decreased 12.3 percent in the euro area and 11.6 percent in ORG7 in [LOCATION]4, compared to [LOCATION]5, according to ORG8. With 14.8 percent, [ORGANIZATION] registered the biggest decline among member states, followed by [PERSON] and [PERSON] each, then [PERSON] -13.7 percent. As the only country of the ORG6, GPE6 saw an increase of it industrial production with 4.5 [LOCATION] There is No Recovery in [LOCATION], And its All Engineered This Way85 This economic crash was designed, and the purpose of the lockdowns worked perfectly to kill small businesses and impoverish the masses. It was all engineered this [STREET] by the political puppets and there is not going to be a recovery. There may be a new system if [ORGANIZATION] are stupid enough to allow it, however, there will be no recovery. If we are smart, once this system crashes and burns, we wont replace it with another system at all. We know the agenda and we understand what they are trying to pull off here, says PERSON3 in his latest video. These subhuman individuals must lie, he says of the [ORGANIZATION] banking cartel hellbent on world domination as they intentionally destroy as many people as possible. Its insulting because The [ORGANIZATION] believes that we are stupid, adds PERSON4. Some are, as we have been dumbed down on purpose, but [ORGANIZATION] are waking up at an alarming rate. The more the bankers try to control and crash the dollar, the more people will awaken to the chains around their necks and begin to live freely away from this rigged slave system. Theyre trying to manipulate your mind because they think youre stupid, said PERSON4. This is what happens when things are this sick and this twisted. These characters are going to continue to lie to you on an epic scale. Its just the norm [LOCATION]6, the lies, the corruption, the propaganda, the misinformation, the misleading of the people on a scale that I dont think weve ever seen before. And that just plays right into [ORGANIZATION], this New [ORGANIZATION]8.86 Im Not Gonna Back Down PERSON5 Responds to Total Political Hit Job Following Arrest87 Former [PERSON]1 strategist [PERSON] appeared no worse for wear during his War Room Pandemic podcast on [LOCATION]7  [LOCATION]8 after posting 5 million bail after his arrest on charges of wire fraud and money laundering related to his involvement with [PERSON]2  a nonprofit organized by wounded [PERSON]3 veteran [ORGANIZATION], which raised over [ORGANIZATION]4 million via crowdfunding and built a half-mile section of border wall in [LOCATION], GPE8. PERSON5 pleaded not guilty, and was in full fight mode during [LOCATION]7s podcast. This fiasco is a total political hit-job. The timing is exquisite in the run-up to the [ORGANIZATION] election, said PERSON5, adding I think it is probably the most important election of our time because the stakes now are so high.88 Wake Up, [PERSON] Up! [PERSON]4 Harasses [ORGANIZATION] Occupants on Residential Street89 A new video out of [LOCATION] shows [PERSON]5 activists chanting wake up, motherfcker wake up! as they shine a light into peoples homes on a residential [STREET] at [TIME]. This is sure to enlist support for their cause. Wake up, mother fker wake up! chant [PERSON]4 in [LOCATION] to[TIME] as they go through residential areas and shut down the streets, tweeted journalist [PERSON] is Real Publicist Says Middle Class amp38 Wealthy Are Fleeing [PERSON]0 Veteran publicist [PERSON] says that the middle class and wealthy are fleeing [PERSON]1, noting that whereas the town once smelled of orange blossoms, it now smells of urine. [PERSON] noted that coronavirus was just the final blow to a city already reeling as a result of its progressive attitude towards homelessness. [PERSON]2 has always been the wokest of the woke, so politicians have done nothing to stop people sleeping on the streets. Its not illegal and the weathers nice, so they keep coming, he said, adding that, there is insufficient housing, inadequate mental health care. Add in [PERSON]3 and its a perfect storm.92 11 Shootings Leave 3 More [ORGANIZATION] in [PERSON]4 [PERSON]5 WABC  The surge in gun violence continues across [PERSON]6, as there have been 11 shootings with 15 victims [PERSON] into [LOCATION]7. Three of those shootings were fatal.94 5 Killed Dog Park, Gas Station, Porch Are Scenes for Phillys Latest [ORGANIZATION]ly Shootings95 [PERSON]7  Five more people were killed in the city of [PERSON]8 within a matter of hours [PERSON] [TIME], including a father leaving a park with his dog and children, a man sitting on his porch, and two people at a gas station.96 A [PERSON] for White [ORGANIZATION]?97 Those who are working overtime to delegitimize white [ORGANIZATION] have coined a term that they use as a weaponwhite privilege. The propaganda is that being white is a racial privilege that elevates white [ORGANIZATION] above other [ORGANIZATION] and enables white people to oppress blacks. It doesnt strike those who use the term as a weapon that these same racist white people are the ones who elected PERSON11 president and put PERSON12 in the [PERSON]6. White privilege conveys the idea that white people have impunity. They can abuse, even kill, people of color without consequence. Yet, it is white officer PERSON13 who is in jail charged with the murder of black PERSON14, while the two black [PERSON]9 teenagers who murdered DATE20 white PERSON15 at the county fair for not giving them a dollar were sentenced by white female judge PERSON16 to anger management training and behavior modification but otherwise unpunished. Here is the report [URL][ORGANIZATION]08black-teens-kill-white-man-county-fair . The story was covered locally for example, [URL]outrage-over-PERSON17-murder-sentencing  but kept out of national news while white [ORGANIZATION] were pumped full of guilt for their racism.98 Another FAC0 Soldier is Missing Hunt is Launched for DATE21 Nuclear Specialist After the Deaths of 11 People DATE[DATE] Linked to the Base99 Local police and [PERSON]7 are searching for DATE23 [PERSON].

His disappearance follows the deaths of 11 FAC0 soldiers DATE24 alone. Of the 11 deaths, foul play is suspected in five of those An independent investigation is currently underway into the embattled army base following the string of deaths and disappearances.100 As [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION] to Give Up101 As the [ORGANIZATION] wave of coronavirus cases and hospitalizations burns itself out  as is always the case with a virus  those authoritarian politicians still clinging to the ability to push their citizens around refuse to give up. As in the Lord of the [ORGANIZATION], they cannot bear letting go of the ring of power. But what will it take for them to finally relinquish their stranglehold on our lives? Many hospitals are now suffering from a lack of patients and deaths among DATE[ORGANIZATION]4 remain nearly non-existent. When is this over? Whats the end game? Watch DATE26 Liberty Report102 As Murders Soar in [ORGANIZATION], Judges Are Freeing More Violent-Crime Suspects on Electronic Monitoring103 Judges in [ORGANIZATION] have increasingly ordered criminal defendants placed into an electronic-monitoring program in lieu of jail, a move police officials blame for the surge in gun violence plaguing the city. On DATE27, 43 people facing murder charges were enrolled in [ORGANIZATION]1 electronic-monitoring program, a 40 increase from the same day [LOCATION]1. In addition, 160 people charged with robbery and 1,000 people charged with illegal gun possession are enrolled as of DATE27, the [ORGANIZATION] Sun-Times reported.104 At Least 5 Killed, 30 Injured in [LOCATION] Wildfires105 Dozens of wildfires searing through LOC2 and [PERSON] have reportedly killed at least five people and injured another 30 civilians and firefighters. A series of lightning strikes on DATE[PERSON]9 sparked multiple fires in [ORGANIZATION]2, [ORGANIZATION]3, [ORGANIZATION]4, GPE[ORGANIZATION]4, and [ORGANIZATION]6 Counties. The wildfires scorched hundreds of structures and forced thousands of residents to evacuate.106 [ORGANIZATION]7 [ORGANIZATION] and Incarceration for Preachers and Worshippers Who Defy COVID Mandates107 PERSON20 edict moved most of state back to Phase 1  a complete ban on businesses and churches from operating indoors108 [ORGANIZATION] PERSON21 in [LOCATION] for Black Ops Cold War109 The trailer was clearly a not-so-veiled reference to the destabilization occurring right now in [ORGANIZATION] Unmasking PERSON11 Book is a Warning111 As the major media work to elect PERSON11s former vice president, PERSON23, and sink PERSON24 bid for a second president term. PERSON11s [DATE], [ORGANIZATION], address, at [ORGANIZATION], on behalf of PERSON[ORGANIZATION]4, was the clearest indication yet that PERSON11 is working for a third presidential term. He wants vindication for his failed presidency and wants to use PERSON[ORGANIZATION]4 as a front for the ultimate capture of state power for revolutionary purposes. In addition to saving political face, PERSON11 represents those here and abroad determined to reduce [ORGANIZATION]8 to the status of third-rate power, unable or unwilling to stop PERSON26 advance. President PERSON27 has said that he wouldnt have won in DATE31 had it not been for PERSON11s failed presidency. PERSON28 book is important to understanding why the [ORGANIZATION]8n people were so desperate for an alternative such as PERSON27. People were fooled by PERSON11, his lies, agents and apologists, but they eventually came to understand there was something sinister, even un-[ORGANIZATION]8n, in the PERSON11 presidency. This was the result not only of PERSON11s failed policies but the facts about his real agenda that slowly but surely came to the publics attention through alternative media, described as samizdat by PERSON[PERSON]9. This is a reference to the unofficial and frowned-upon journalism that served as a channel for freedom fighters in the old GPE[PERSON]9. Indeed, he dedicates the book to his fellow Lilliputians, who dared to take on the PERSON30-type powers that be. It gets to the point, and we have arrived at this point DATE32 in [PERSON]0, where the official outlets for the establishment are not believed anymore, and people are desperate and hungry for alternative voices. Hence, the major media and the [ORGANIZATION] censors will want to destroy the PERSON[PERSON]9 book and, if that is not successful, censor any mention of it.112 [ORGANIZATION] Aldermen Delay Decision to Declare State of Emergency at Special Council Meeting113 [PERSON]1  [PERSON]9 voted to send a resolution to declare a state of emergency and deploy [LOCATION] to ORG21 [LOCATION]7, delaying any concrete decisions. A small group of aldermen called a rare special meeting [LOCATION]7 to discuss the guard and other public safety issues, but [DATE]or PERSON31 and her allies pushed the issues into the committee, which will meet at a later time.114 ORG[DATE] Bans PERSON32 Shooter After He Refused to Wear Face Mask During Flight115 The former ORG23 SEAL who claims he shot and killed PERSON33 was banned by [ORGANIZATION] after he allegedly failed to wear a face mask during a recent flight.

Born and bred in [PERSON]3, [PERSON] took his family and fled to [PERSON]4 after the [PERSON]5 riots in [LOCATION]4 when someone tried to break into his apartment. Since then, the city has continued to suffer a huge surge in shootings and violent crime as well as an anemic financial recovery from the coronavirus lockdown.120 ORG27 Investigates Car Bomb Threat That Closed Federal Buildings in [LOCATION]121 [PERSON]5, [LOCATION]  Federal buildings in [LOCATION] are closed [LOCATION]7 citing a threat of violence in the area. The ORG27 of [LOCATION] is investigating the credibility of a car bomb threat was made against federal offices in [LOCATION]. Two law enforcement officials spoke to ORG[PERSON]9 on condition of anonymity because they werent authorized to discuss the investigation publicly. They said the threat was received [PERSON] and warned of the intention to use a car bomb to target federal property.1[DATE] [PERSON]4 Man [LOCATION]7 Youll be in Your Bunk123 [PERSON]4 Man [LOCATION]7 isnt just a time to sit back with a cocktail while letting your mind settle down into [LOCATION]2end mode. Its also a time of DATE36  for [PERSON]4s best-in-the-nation sunshine law that requires practically every government document be made available to the public. As State Attorney General PERSON37 describes it, the law provides that any records made or received by any public agency in the course of its official business are available for inspection, unless specifically exempted by the [PERSON]4 Legislature. Over DATE37, the definition of what constitutes public records has come to include not just traditional written documents such as papers, maps and books, but also tapes, photographs, film, sound recordings and records stored in computers. Plus mugshots of the criminally deranged, more than a few shocking police records of the high and mighty, and everything else in between  all in a state whose warm weather and gorgeous beaches and major theme parks attract a broad selection of humanity unlike almost anywhere else on [ORGANIZATION]. Two cheers  with a strong drink in hand  for open government. With all that in mind, join me now on another thrill-a-minute [PERSON]4 Man [LOCATION]7!124 Fly Repeatedly Lands on Bloombergs Face During ORG26 Speech1[ORGANIZATION]4 A fly landed on PERSON38 twice during a pre-recorded speech at [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] [TIME]. The fly first landed on his eyebrow at the 2[ORGANIZATION]4 mark.126 [ORGANIZATION] PERSON39 Decries Total Absence of God In Democrat Convention127 Celebrated Christian pastor [ORGANIZATION] PERSON39 denounced the total absence of God in this [LOCATION]2s [ORGANIZATION], calling on [ORGANIZATION] to bring God back into public life. In watching some of [ORGANIZATION] on television this [LOCATION]2, it has been interesting to see the absence of God, Rev. PERSON39 wrote on his [ORGANIZATION]6 page early [LOCATION]7. I dont believe [ORGANIZATION]8s finest hours will be in front of us if we take God out of government and public life.128 Golden State Killer PERSON41 Sentenced to Life in Prison for 26 Rapes, Murders1[PERSON]9 A former [ORGANIZATION]7 police officer nicknamed PERSON42 was sentenced to life in prison without parole for a [DATE] series of 26 rapes and murders that terrorized the state.130 PERSON43 Gave PERSON44 [PERSON] at ORG31 Report131 PERSON43 gifted a prestigious job in the PERSON11 ORG31 to the nephew of accused pedophile and sex trafficker PERSON45, according to [PERSON] whose employment was confirmed by [ORGANIZATION] Officers, [PERSON], And [PERSON] During One of Two Mass Gatherings in [LOCATION]133 In [TIME] of [DATE], [ORGANIZATION], two events took [STREET] in [LOCATION]. One group gathered at FAC1 located on the 8400 block of [ORGANIZATION]. The group left the park [TIME] and began marching throughout neighborhoods in North [LOCATION]. While the group marched, streets were blocked. The group stopped briefly outside of the [LOCATION] Police Association office on the 1800 block of [PERSON]. For [TIME], the group marched through North [LOCATION] and later dispersed after returning to FAC1. [TIME], a separate group of about 100 people began gathering outside of the ORG36 ORG37 building located on the 4300 block of [PERSON]. While the group was outside the ORG37 building they began blocking vehicular traffic at FAC5 and [ORGANIZATION]. The group was also supported by several support-type vehicles. At times, these vehicles were seen blocking vehicular traffic. Several people in the crowd were seen carrying shields and wearing helmets and gas masks.134 ORG38 [PERSON] on Kicking Family Off Plane Because [PERSON]1 Wasnt Wearing a Mask135 ORG39 kicked an entire family off one of its flights this [LOCATION]2 because one [PERSON]2 child wasnt wearing a face mask, and the airline doubled down on the decision even after intense criticism. Even after the mother of the family of six vowed to force the child to put on a mask, they were all still asked to leave the plane.136 PERSON23 Vows National Mask Mandate if Elected President137 Every single [ORGANIZATION]8n should be wearing a mask when they are outside for [PERSON]3 at a minimum, PERSON[ORGANIZATION]4 said.138 [PERSON]4 [ORGANIZATION] Sales See [PERSON] of 24.7139 Sales from existing homes rose 24.7 from [LOCATION]4 to [PERSON]4, the highest [PERSON]5 gain in the history of the survey since [PERSON]6, according to [PERSON]0 PERSON46 a Calamity for [ORGANIZATION]8141 PERSON47 was a frontier heroine in the [PERSON]7 who during an uprising in [PERSON]8, saved a Captain PERSON48 from certain death, whereupon he told her I name you PERSON47, the heroine of the plains. This is in stark contrast to PERSON46 of [PERSON]9 [ORGANIZATION]8, who would accelerate the downfall of our [PERSON]7 in the unlikely event of a PERSON[ORGANIZATION]4-PERSON49 win on [PERSON]0. Why? Because PERSON[ORGANIZATION]4 and PERSON49 are promising to resurrect the failed policies of [DATE], and inflict even more damage on [ORGANIZATION]8 the Beautiful. According to author and television host PERSON50, although the media are rushing to portray [ORGANIZATION]7s junior senator as a moderate, nothing could be further from the truth. She is the most extremist radical politician ever to run for high office in the [PERSON]A., PERSON51 states, even farther left than 97 of the Democrats in the [PERSON] [PERSON]6, even left of avowed Marxist Democratic socialist [PERSON]. PERSON51 and his guest attorney [PERSON] provided several examples. PERSON46, they said When it comes to support for Jewish issues in [ORGANIZATION]8 as well as support for GPE40, the estimable PERSON54 in his powerful article, [ORGANIZATION] is [PERSON] of Jews, has a warning PERSON11 and PERSON55 both signed off on [LOCATION]8s nuclear program and the flow of money to terrorists. In addition, While PERSON55 has been depicted as a moderate, her chief of staff, PERSON56, was the national spokeswoman and senior adviser for [PERSON]2, the radical group with a long history of trafficking in anti-Semitism and attacking the Jewish State. And, [PERSON] reminds us, PERSON46 is a full-throated supporter of the virulently anti-Semitic members of the so-called [PERSON]3. PERSON58 D-MN, [PERSON]4. PERSON59 D-MI, [PERSON]4. PERSON60 D-MA, [PERSON]4. PERSON61 D-GPE41, and all the others who avidly support both [ORGANIZATION] movement to destroy GPE40 economically and to deny foreign aid to [ORGANIZATION]8s staunchest ally in [ORGANIZATION]. In a chilling but all-too-credible warning, [PERSON] says that Jewish Democrats who imagine that GPE40 is the problem are about to learn theyre the problem.142 [PERSON]5 [PERSON], War Paint for Fans Attending Games143 The [PERSON]6 [PERSON]5 are instituting a new dress code for fans attending their games [PERSON]2 in an effort to be more sensitive to concerns over Native [ORGANIZATION]8n imagery.

Following PERSON55 speech, which leftist talking heads gushed over, dropping any pretence of bipartisanship, admitting that it made them cry, The ORG26 cut to a shot of individuals watching online. However, critics noted that some of the individuals seen clapping like sealions were duplicated, apparently in an effort to make it appear that there were more excited Democrat voters watching.168 We Now Have the Best Evidence Yet That Everyone Develops Long-Term Coronavirus Immunity After Infection  and its Not Just About Antibodies169 A study published [LOCATION]7 in the journal ORG62 suggests that everyone who gets [ORGANIZATION]  even people with mild or asymptomatic cases  develops T cells that can hunt down the coronavirus if they get exposed again later.170 Woke Capitalism How Huge Corporations Demonstrate Status by Endorsing Political Radicalism171 Its a rather strange claim of the [ORGANIZATION]8n far left that their interests are opposed to that of corporate [ORGANIZATION]8, because theres virtually no evidence to support it. Quite the contrary During the wave of [PERSON]5 rioting that took [STREET] during [DATE] of [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]8n corporations marched in lockstep. Not only did they use social media to swear fealty to this political movement, but they also made massive internal changes in conformity with [PERSON]4 propaganda. Its called woke capitalism and while its not necessarily new, its certainly more prevalent than it ever has been. The term itself was coined by conservative editorial writer PERSON80 in [ORGANIZATION]0. He succinctly summed up what woke capitalism is superficial nods toward cultural leftism that allow the company to do what it really exists to do  make money. You might be confused or think that theres something ironic or askew about major corporations backing supposed rebel ideologies. However, this stems from a very surface understanding of the topic. When we delve deeper into it, the motivation for large corporations siding with ostensibly anti-capitalist groups will come clearly into focus.172 Doctors Urge Families to Wear Masks at [ORGANIZATION] as [ORGANIZATION] COVID Rules1[DATE] Growing number of Belgians suspect coronavirus rules are power grab.174 [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]locked175 ORG63 negotiators have reportedly rejected a British offer of a bilateral pact to return illegal migrants, while a seventh round of [ORGANIZATION] trade negotiations has again ended in deadlock.

Both countries along with others in ORG7, such as [LOCATION]0, are worried that the base could cement ORG[DATE] growing power in the [LOCATION]0, according to Czech news portal Echo24.200 [PERSON]s Strategic Plan for GPE68201 by [PERSON]8 The Turkish and Qatari ORG77 Ministers recently visited [LOCATION]1 to meet the head of ORG75, [PERSON]9.

[PERSON] Deputy ORG77 Minister [PERSON]4 also took part in the meetings and provided insights into the current readiness of ORG76 forces in terms of structure, personnel, equipment, and operational capabilities. The defense ministers of the supporting countries agreed to provide the ORG76 forces with cross-functional support, from logistics and military equipment to operational planning and training through expat military advisors. 202 [PERSON]5 Is [ORGANIZATION] or [ORGANIZATION]?203 Since GPE40 was established, the Palestinian veto doomed all efforts to forge peace between the Arab world and the Jewish state. The Palestinian veto rests on a toxic proposition that [ORGANIZATION] right to exist is contingent on its satisfaction of Palestinian claims against it. So long as the Palestinians say they are unappeased, GPE40 cannot expect the Arab world to either recognize or live at peace with it. The very existence of the veto has ensured that the Palestinians will never be satisfied with any GPE40i concession and will never agree to peaceful coexistence with the Jewish state. After all, their global and regional importance is a product of the veto. The Arabs, and much of the rest of the world support the Palestinians because they wield the veto. As holders of the veto, the Palestinians are viewed as the key  or the key obstacle  to [LOCATION]1 peace. If they give up, or lose the veto, they will lose their position and power to enable or block peace and foment war and instability. As for the Arab leaders, for generations the Palestinian veto was the key to their own power and stability. It enabled them to deflect the attention of their peoples and of the governments of the world away from their corruption, extremism and failure at home and abroad. It enabled them to scapegoat GPE40 blaming the Jewish state for the suffering and stagnation of their people. Given its toxic power, abrogating the Palestinian veto has always been [ORGANIZATION] highest goal. And given its centrality for both the Palestinians and the wider Arab world, for most GPE40is, it seemed like a dream so impossible that it wasnt even worth dreaming. The peace treaties GPE40 signed with [LOCATION]4 and [LOCATION]5 were concluded while genuflecting to the Palestinian veto. [LOCATION]4ian president [PERSON]7 signed [LOCATION]4s peace deal with GPE40 only after he concluded a framework deal for Palestinian autonomy with then GPE40i prime minister [PERSON]8. King [PERSON]9 of [LOCATION]5 only agreed to sign a peace deal with the GPE40i prime minister [PERSON] after PERSON111 signed the [LOCATION]6 peace deal with [ORGANIZATION] chief PERSON112 on the [PERSON]1 lawn. Since signing their peace treaties with GPE40, [LOCATION]4 and [LOCATION]5 have continuously breached them by refusing to implement the clauses of their deals that require them to normalize their relations with GPE40. Both use the Palestinian veto to justify their material breaches, which have reduced both historic treaties into little more than long-term ceasefires. The big news last [PERSON] that with [PERSON] President [PERSON] PERSON27s mediation, GPE40 and [LOCATION]7 have agreed to develop full diplomatic ties is being presented as a strategic earthquake. This is so not because the announced deal advances commercial ties between the countries, nor is it being presented in this manner because the deal advances the GPE40i-Arab campaign to prevent [LOCATION]8 from advancing its nuclear weapons program. While the deal does both of those things, it is being presented as a strategic earthquake because policymakers and commentators proclaim that it abrogated the Palestinian veto. If these claims are true, then last [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION] diplomatic standing was [ORGANIZATION], But [DATE] Backfire206 by PERSON114 A ORG80 tribunal vindicated ORG79 leadership of the DATE88 assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister [PERSON]. The ruling, delivered [ORGANIZATION]1, was the result of a DATE89 investigation and deliberation. [PERSON] Although the group largely escaped blame, ORG79 member PERSON116 was found guilty in the murder. Despite the fact that the tribunals conclusion was undoubtedly a victory for the group, it may do more harm than good. That is because the Lebanese people wanted justice. The trial chamber is of the view that [LOCATION]9 and ORG79 may have had motives to eliminate Mr. [PERSON] and his political allies, however there is no evidence that the ORG79 leadership had any involvement in Mr. [PERSON]s murder and there is no direct evidence of [LOCATION]9n involvement, said Judge [PERSON], summarizing the 2,600-page verdict. 207 ORG81 Will Start Broadcasting for GPE80208 The management of ORG82 ORG81 has decided to modify its current schedule and will introduce special information programs in [LOCATION] on its ORG83.

As always, well cover the new treatment models that are focused on behavioral modifications and engagement for those who are depressed, anxious or seriously mentally ill. In some ways, software is mimicking what we should be doing as families and communities - engaging constantly with our loved ones, guiding them to see the hope and beauty in life and enabling them to realize theyre capable of changing their unfortunate circumstances, or at the least view them through a more positive lens. Sometimes, however, people truly are mentally ill and they find themselves living on the streets.According to [ORGANIZATION] Org2,at least 25 percent of the homeless population suffer from serious mental illness."
portland,2020-01-29T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,KATU,"homeless, homelessness",Invent Health - Helping the mentally ill among the homeless,"Government policies, such as the reduction of psychiatric beds, have certainly contributed. But other policies and cultural norms enable others who are not mentally ill to accept homelessness. The culture of entitlement is not healthy and its not lost on those on the streets. When they demand free housing as a constitutional right, they are casting themselves as victims and promoting a defeatist view of their own abilities. This is where it becomes a problem.Victimology and rampant drug abuse are pervasive at homeless encampments and the combination makes homeless encampments a feeding ground for mental illness. So what can help?One group hoping to do their part in fighting the homeless crisis identifies loss of employment as the No. 1 reason behind people living on the [STREET]. The organization, called [ORGANIZATION] focuses on helping the homeless get jobs. Its one of the better solutions around because it hits at the heart of the problem. People dont just need a [STREET] to live, they need their dignity. In this roundup, heres a curation of some recent articles about whats happening from a public policy and private sector standpoint to address homelessness and mental health. Join us DATE0 for [ORGANIZATION] with executives from [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], Head of ORG2 Chief Science Officer Dr. [PERSON], SVP of Behavioral Health at ORG3 CEO PERSON4 PERSON5, [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION] Prosecute homeless and sentence them to treatmentRecently [ORGANIZATION] Assemblyman [PERSON] proposed a measure5 to prosecute the mentally ill homeless people and sentence them into treatment. Importantly, he wants certain crimes, like defecating on public transportation or using heroin or [LOCATION] in public to be strictly enforced. A special [STREET] would be created to determine why those crimes were committed and sentence the defendant to shelters, drug rehab, or an appropriate treatment plan. The conviction would be expunged once a person completes the sentence.[ORGANIZATION] doesnt agree with [ORGANIZATION] because his plan doesnt like the criminalization aspect. But at the same time, the publication has no alternative solution, only to say [PERSON] concentrate on getting them housing and mental health services. I agree. But lets also not enable and support the homeless lifestyle. Showing compassion also means having faith that teaching the homeless about accountability, consequence and mutual respect for others is part of being in a society. Additionally, [ORGANIZATION]s plan certainlybeats the proposal by PERSON9 who recently became district attorney of [PERSON]. [PERSON] says that he wouldnt prosecute crimes such as public camping, offering or soliciting sex, public urination, blocking a sidewalk, etc. [PERSON] blames SFs homelessness on evictions and corporate landlords. But its more than that. Its not more compassionate to allow people to live on the streets. Its compassionate to give them assistance and dignity.

We love having PERSON11 at our events. Meanwhile, ORG7 corporate has been very busy making pledges to help the homeless crisis. DATE2, ORG7 announced8 that its pledging 5 million to get hundreds off the streets of [ORGANIZATION]. DATE3, ORG7 announced a similar program albeit a larger 25 million fund to address [ORGANIZATION]s homeless crisis. Its likely these plans were influenced by [ORGANIZATION] Gov. PERSON12 executive order creating a 750 million fund to fight homelessness. The funds are to go toward mental health services, subsidized housing, rent, care homes and 100 campers and modular tents to be used as temporary housing. Safe and stable housing is key to a persons physical, mental and social health, said [PERSON], CEO of the [PERSON]-based nonprofit healthcare company. Chronic homelessness has been shown to cut [PERSON] from the average lifespan and is associated with communicable diseases such as hepatitis and typhus, increased hospitalizations, and frequent readmissions. ORG7 also said in a statement [PERSON] increases the level and amount of care the health system must provide, even as it limits how successful that care can be. Common conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and asthma are nearly impossible to manage without housing. ORG7s headquarters are in [PERSON], which has seen the largest [PERSON] of any city in [ORGANIZATION]. If you live around [PERSON], youre aware of the large homeless encampment by [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] will be shutting the10 encampment down in [ORGANIZATION], according to just-released reports.[PERSON]. A brief history of mental illness, homelessness and crimeOne of the reasons cited for why mental illness is prolific among the homeless is because of deinstitutionalization12, a government policy [PERSON] that moved mental health patients into federally-funded community mental health centers and away from state-funded insane asylums. Within DATE8, from [ORGANIZATION], about 487,000 patients were discharged from the state-run hospitals, which eventually closed. Additionally, the two groups - the local centers and state-funded centers had conflicts, which led to an exacerbation of the homeless and mental health crisis. In [LOCATION]0, a study by [ORGANIZATION]0 noted that relationships between the community and public mental health facilities exist at a relatively minimal level. Another done in [LOCATION]1 by [ORGANIZATION]1 of [ORGANIZATION]2 [ORGANIZATION]3 said 8216The relationship between the [ORGANIZATION]4 community mental health centers and public psychiatric hospital is difficult at best, adversarial at worst.8217 Another reason for the rise in homelessness could be the tough-on-crime policies that drove up incarcerations [LOCATION]2. The logic is that when people left jail they ended up in the streets. In [LOCATION]3 however,according to [LOCATION]4 reports issued by [ORGANIZATION]5, several hundred state laws were put in motion that make sentencing less rigid and less severe. The result, fewer incarcerations, but which also meant more people on the [STREET].

Actually, its still a topic of discussion despite the entire narrative having more holes through it than PERSON39 and [PERSON]. As [ORGANIZATION]0 of ORG33 told [ORGANIZATION], it appears that ORG31 Director PERSON38 might be the person blocking the declassification of documents that could shed more light on this myth.

But the ORG37 movement, supported at least in part by 56 of Republican voters, is one that the media and some members of ORG38 are particularly annoyed with. ORG39 [DATE]2 almost unanimously voted to condemn ORG37 supporters.

While many are still attacking anyone warning of the coming Microchip as a conspiracy theorist, Luddite, or religious fanatic, that microchip has arrived. But governments arent having to market the chip as a method to track, trace, and control their populations. Instead, they are marketing the chip as a [STREET] to track and detect [ORGANIZATION] and other coronaviruses.

I dont that this will happen, but one can never underestimate just how underhanded Democrats can get. Virtually all Democrats say that voter fraud is non-existent but the evidence is overwhelmingly proving that it is rampant. During the [ORGANIZATION]4 mid-term election democrat activists were caught teaching illegals how to vote twice because no ID is required. See why Democrats fight voter ID. Democrat activists have been caught red-handed issuing Spanish-language instructions to illegal aliens regarding how to vote not once, but twice, in the midterm elections, while assuring them they will get away with voting Democrat twice because no ID is required. The illegal text messages targeting Spanish-speaking illegal aliens across many states are also spreading fear-based propaganda about President [PERSON]2, with many of the messages referring to the president of the [ORGANIZATION] ORG[ORGANIZATION]9s as the anti-Christ who wants to murder Mexicans.

Several companies whose financing partners are not to be known were involved in the deal. Probe records point to the dealmaker [ORGANIZATION]3 as the person directing the operation.
