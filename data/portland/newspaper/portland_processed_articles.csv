The pandemic, the protests, and a series of climate-related crises exposed major fault lines in Portland, from public safety and racial inequity to gentrification and homelessness. Wheeler, who is regularly accosted when he goes out in public, is facing a recall campaign5. Business leaders have pressed city officials to be more aggressive in their treatment of protesters and in clearing homeless encampments.

Now that the team has been blocked from independently responding to homes and other private spaces, for instance, PSR can maintain its limited mission, or try to co-respond more frequently with officers.33 One of chief drivers of the backlash against police reform is concern about homelessness and related public safety issues, a debate that Portland Street Response is also wrapped up in. Some who request the teams services want it to clear homeless encampments, which is not part of its mission. There tends to be these two communities, said Burek. One community wants this alternative to police response, and another community, largely people who live in residences near homeless camps, wants more of an enforcement.34 Homelessness is one of Portlands most divisive, complex issues. Its often chalked up to the city offering generous services to houseless individuals. However, research indicates that housing unaffordability is a more significant driver of homelessness. Between 2012 and 2017, rents in Portland rose faster than income, while home prices jumped28 citywide by over 88,000 between 2014 and 2019. Today, 46 percent of renters in the greater Portland region spend more than 30 percent of their income on rent.35 According to city officials, there were about six large encampments in Portland before the pandemic as of June, they numbered more than 100. Tents and other structures dot sidewalks, green spaces, and the shoulders of exit ramps throughout the city. During the past year, the Homelessness and Urban Camping Impact Reduction Program was receiving a record 1,700 complaints about encampments each week, according to The Washington Post. People typically assume because homelessness is more visible, rates of homelessness have gone up, said Greg Townley, research director at Portland State Universitys Homelessness Research amp38 Action Collaborative29. Such a rise may be looming as eviction moratoriums end, Townley noted, but the visibility of the thousands of people living without housing mostly reflects the fact that Portland paused what had amounted to dozens of weekly sweeps of encampments after the CDC recommended that people be allowed to shelter in place.36 Portland has resumed some sweeps, which the city calls clean-ups. Some residents feel that removals arent happening fast enough, while others argue that they are an inhumane measure that prioritizes aesthetics over the well-being of unhoused people, who often lose their belongings in the process. Sweeps are not an approach that has been shown to effectively address the issue that were facing in terms of housing shortages, Townley said.","homeless, homelessness, affordable housing, unhoused, houseless",184,15,True,True,7,6

portland,Protesters swarmed a Columbia Sportswear store after its CEO said the company may close its office due to safety concerns,2017-12-04T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,The Oregonian,"Signs around downtown now say that loitering is prohibited, and that the sidewalk is for pedestrian movement only  a reference to Portlands no-sit policy, according to The Oregonian. Though the letter itself did not mention homelessness at all, some in the Portland community interpreted the signs and the letter as an attack on an already-vulnerable population. We think its disgusting that a CEO that happened to give so much money to Mayor Ted Wheelers campaign can write an op-ed and instantly these signs go up that no one is allowed to sit in front of his business, Gregory McKelvey, the founder of Portlands Resistance, the group that organized the protest, told NBC affiliate KGW News3. We shouldnt be criminalizing things homeless people need to do to survive. Protesters held signs with slogans like Homelessness is a last resort, not a crime and Making hardship harder wont make it go away. In a statement released on Saturday, Wheeler said Its irresponsible to conflate homelessness and crime. We can address safety issues with common sense enforcement. We can address homelessness with compassion. Thats our plan. The store reopened on Sunday, but the protesters say they may be back. In response to the protests, Columbia released a statement from Boyle A couple of weeks ago, Columbia Sportswear Company delivered a truckload of coats to Transition Projects, an important nonprofit that assists homeless individuals in Portland, and our team participated in TV interviews stressing the importance of providing support for communities in need. The same day, I published an opinion piece in The Oregonian urging city leaders to address urgent safety issues in downtown Portland in part by providing resources for community policing. My opinion piece in The Oregonian did not address homelessness generally. The word does not appear in the article, because the concerns about safety are not tied solely to that issue. The call for community policing resources got far more attention, but the spotlight needs to be much broader. You would be hard-pressed to name all the agencies and enterprises who are involved in some way in these inter-related issues. There are issues that touch the state, the city, the county, and there are no doubt resources being spent by public bodies that no one thinks of in connection with homelessness. At times Portlanders seem to be talking past each other, choosing one side or another to what is inherently a multi-sided issue. We can and should - and We do - show compassion to support individuals in need. At the same time, we can and should provide resources for law enforcement to provide greater safety for all. While this a challenging situation, I refuse to give up, and I would encourage all Oregonians to devote time, attention, and, yes, resources to address the complex issues surrounding homelessness. In meetings with local and state leaders in recent months I have offered to contribute personally to genuine solutions  not policing  and I have reiterated my belief that others in the business community should join this effort. I am glad to call business leaders personally to ask them to contribute. We cannot solve all problems, and we will likely never address all the needs related to homelessness, but as Oregonians we can make meaningful progress if our leaders business, government, nonprofits and others have the will to do so.

Many have underlying health conditions6, including chronic lung disease, HIVAIDS, and mental illness, as well as higher levels of stress, which can weaken the immune system. Even in the absence of a viral pandemic, people experiencing unsheltered homelessness have a mortality rate almost 10 times the general populations and nearly three times that of people living in shelters. Access to sanitation facilities, limited under ordinary circumstances, has been further complicated as public spaces like libraries close and service providers suspend operations in response to the pandemic.8 The first confirmed death from Covid-19 in the US homeless population occurred on March 16 in Silicon Valley since then, in New York City, at least two others have died, and dozens of people living in shelters have tested positive for the coronavirus.

That mission is much more amplified in its importance now, given the need to focus hospital resources on treating Covid-19.16 Beginning on March 11, PSM worked alongside the Multnomah County Department of Public Health and others in an effort to reach as much of the citys unhoused population as possible with information about Covid-19 and supplies, including hand sanitizer. At first, Toepper said, many of the people they spoke with seemed uninterested or suspicious, but over the course of a week, they became increasingly concerned. Like Julie, many were afraid of being swept up and imprisoned in shelterlike environments.17 Advocates argue8 that Covid-19 should not be used to forcibly move people into shelters. Instead, theyre calling for cities to house people in hotels or other private accommodations during the crisis, and they call for significant increases in funding for housing assistance. It has never been more clear that housing is health care, said Diane Yentel, the president and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, in a statement. Advocates worry not only that the pandemic poses risks to individuals without housing but also that the economic fallout could push others into homelessness. The relief package passed by Congress addressed9 some of these concerns, providing 4billion to assist homeless shelters and outreach workers, 1.25 billion for Section8 housing vouchers, 685 million for public housing, and a limited eviction moratorium. Governors in Oregon, California, and other states have implemented broader moratoriums on residential evictions.18 In response to the pandemic, Portland, along with other cities, decided to limit its regular sweeps of encampments10, in accordance with new guidance11 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which advised that clearing camps could cause people to disperse throughout the community and break connections with service providers. This will be a reprieve for many people living outdoors in Portland, which, like so many other cities, has been embroiled in contentious debates about housing affordability and the encampments. The ask from the people living outside is, If we could just stay put for a little while, wed be better able to clean up, wed do better, we would have less impact on our city, Toepper said. After some initial confusion about whether and how Oregons stay-home order affected people without housing, Governor Kate Brown recently clarified12 that her directive is not intended to serve as an enforcement mechanism against Oregons unsheltered population.19 of Portland Street Medicine prepare to treat people experiencing homelessness in the Portland area.

But other policies and cultural norms enable others who are not mentally ill to accept homelessness. The culture of entitlement is not healthy and its not lost on those on the streets. When they demand free housing as a constitutional right, they are casting themselves as victims and promoting a defeatist view of their own abilities. This is where it becomes a problem. Victimology and rampant drug abuse are pervasive at homeless encampments and the combination makes homeless encampments a feeding ground for mental illness.

This week, KP announced8 that its pledging 5 million to get hundreds off the streets of Portland. A week ago, KP announced a similar program albeit a larger 25 million fund to address Californias homeless crisis. Its likely these plans were influenced by California Gov. Gavin Newsoms executive order creating a 750 million fund to fight homelessness. The funds are to go toward mental health services, subsidized housing, rent, care homes and 100 campers and modular tents to be used as temporary housing. Safe and stable housing is key to a persons physical, mental and social health, said Greg Adams, CEO of the Oakland-based nonprofit healthcare company. Chronic homelessness has been shown to cut 27 years from the average lifespan and is associated with communicable diseases such as hepatitis and typhus, increased hospitalizations, and frequent readmissions. KP also said in a statement Homelessness increases the level and amount of care the health system must provide, even as it limits how successful that care can be. Common conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and asthma are nearly impossible to manage without housing. KPs headquarters are in Oakland, which has seen the largest two-year increase9 of any city in California. If you live around Oakland, youre aware of the large homeless encampment by Home Depot. California will be shutting the10 encampment down in February, according to just-released reports. Read more11. A brief history of mental illness, homelessness and crimeOne of the reasons cited for why mental illness is prolific among the homeless is because of deinstitutionalization12, a government policy circa 1960s that moved mental health patients into federally-funded community mental health centers and away from state-funded insane asylums. Within 40 years, from 1955-1994, about 487,000 patients were discharged from the state-run hospitals, which eventually closed. Additionally, the two groups - the local centers and state-funded centers had conflicts, which led to an exacerbation of the homeless and mental health crisis. In 1972, a study by the National Institute of Mental Health noted that relationships between the community and public mental health facilities exist at a relatively minimal level. Another done in 1979 by the Inspector General of the US Dept. of Health, Education and Welfare said 8216The relationship between the CMHCs community mental health centers and public psychiatric hospital is difficult at best, adversarial at worst.8217 Another reason for the rise in homelessness could be the tough-on-crime policies that drove up incarcerations prior to 2000. The logic is that when people left jail they ended up in the streets.","homeless, homelessness",52,30,True,True,2,1
