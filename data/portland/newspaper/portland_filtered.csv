Did you know you can support The Nation by drinking wine? In late July, Portland, Ore., held a grand reopening of its downtown. Hollowed out by the pandemic, which banished office workers and tourists, the neighborhood became the site of massive demonstrations against police brutality2 after the murder of George Floyd. Throughout the summer of 2020, protesters faced off against local and federal law enforcement in nightly clashes that inevitably ended in tear gas, flash-bang grenades, and arrests. Even after direct actions became small and sporadic, many storefronts remained boarded upa detail often mentioned in a barrage of media coverage characterizing the Rose City as dangerous, trashed, even dying.1 Resurrecting downtown Portland, and the citys image, has been a major focus for Mayor Ted Wheeler and other city leaders this year. By the reopening event, much of the plywood had come down the band Pink Martini led a sing-along for a crowd in Pioneer Courthouse Square, and city commissioners Carmen Rubio, Mingus Mapps, and Jo Ann Hardesty cut a red ribbon to mark the opening of a new pod of food carts, several of which had been displaced from their previous location a few blocks north by the construction of a 35-story tower that will house 138 luxury condos and a Ritz-Carlton hotel. Today is the beginning of a new Portland, Mapps told the crowd.2 What this new Portland should look likeand whom it should serveremains a matter of fierce debate. To many Portlanders, the months of sustained protest that followed Floyds murder were historic, electrifying, and potentially transformational for a city with a deep history3 of racial exclusion and police violence. Portlands Black residents, who make up 6 percent of the citys population, have for decades endured harassment from police officers. The city has one of the worst racial disparities in arrests in the United States, and for nearly a decade the Portland Police Bureau has been under the supervision of the Department of Justice because of a pattern of using excessive force against people with mental illness. Though efforts to reform the bureau began decades before last years uprising, never before had so many white residents been attuned to the issue. Longtime activists sensed a remarkable opportunity. Aint nobody scared of police no more, Kent Ford, who founded the Portland chapter of the Black Panther Party in 1969, said recently. If I dont see nothing else, Ive seen how it came together here.3 After two weeks of demonstrations, the police chief stepped down. The City Council redirected 15 million from policing to communities of color and to Portland Street Response, a non-police pilot program intended to assist people in mental health crises, and dissolved a handful of controversial police units. In November, 80 percent of Portland voters approved a new independent police oversight board, which will have the power to discipline and fire officers for misconduct. It was understood that all of this would be only a start toward making the whitest major city4 in America more equitable. Black-led organizations developed a sweeping agenda to dismantle systemic racism not only in policing but also in housing, transportation, education, economic development, and health care across the state.4 But some Portlanders came to see the demonstrations as a threat to the citys appeal to tourists and investors. Lenders and purchasers have for all intents and purposes blacklisted Portland, said John Russell, a longtime Portland real estate developer. Dramatic clashes between protesters and law enforcement provided the opportunity for right-wing politicians and media to depict the city as besieged by violent anarchists and, as Donald Trump claimed, ablaze all the time. Commenters linked Portlands protest movement to homelessness and rising gun violence, marshaling it all as evidence of a city in precipitous decline.5 Now, with civic leaders focused on economic recovery, advocates are concerned that efforts to rehabilitate Portlands brand may eclipse the tentative steps taken toward reform. The pandemic, the protests, and a series of climate-related crises exposed major fault lines in Portland, from public safety and racial inequity to gentrification and homelessness. Wheeler, who is regularly accosted when he goes out in public, is facing a recall campaign5. Business leaders have pressed city officials to be more aggressive in their treatment of protesters and in clearing homeless encampments. Gun violence has fueled calls for reinvestment in Portlands police force and the reinstatement of some of the disbanded units. During the weekend of the downtown reopening, FBI agents and members of a new police unit coordinated to provide a high-visibility presence6a potent illustration of how the winds have shifted.6 We really are a tale of two cities, said Hardesty, who has led police reform efforts on the City Council. One is a city that would like to flip a switch and pretend that the last 15 months didnt happenlike, Lets just clean up the graffiti, get the trash up, and move all the houseless people so we can look like everythings back to normal. And then you have another city that understands we have to fundamentally, radically change a lot of our systems.7 Current Issue many Portland residents, I have fielded a number of questions about how safe the city is from friends living elsewhere. My immediate reaction has been exasperation Even at the height of the protests, when federal agents were firing impact munitions at moms in bike helmets, violence was evident only around the plazas downtown. During the day, I sometimes ran along the waterfront and through downtown. The streets were quiet, the stores shutteredbut downtown had felt empty long before Floyd was murdered, since the pandemic cleared out the office workers and tourists who make up the bulk of its foot traffic. Yes, there was more graffiti. But I never felt unsafe.8 And yet it wasnt accurate to tell friends that everything in Portland was fine. Far-right groups had turned the city into a culture war battleground. Activists and some journalists had been brutalized. Business owners were struggling with pandemic restrictions, which were stricter in Oregon than in many other states. Shootings were rising, and in June, dozens of people died during an unprecedented heat wave. The fact that some 4,000 people lacked housing became impossible to ignore as the city paused its regular sweeps of homeless encampments7 and tents became more visible. The weakness of the states mental health care system became starker, too There were few sources of help that residents could call during encounters with people in the midst of a crisis.9 Many of these challenges are not unique to Portland. But the media attention magnified them and often situated them within a longstanding narrative about local Democratic leadership collapsing into anarchy. This story line took hold during the early years of the Trump administration, as far-right groups repeatedly chose Portland as a staging ground for media spectacles like the Trump Free Speech Rally organized by Patriot Prayer, a pro-Trump group, in 2017, just days after a white supremacist murdered two people8 on Portlands light rail. Clashes between these far-right activists and local anti-fascists led to obsessive coverage from conservative outlets like National Review, which devoted a cover story in 2018 to the left-wing goons and thugs who ostensibly controlled Portland.10 The immense Black Lives Matter demonstrations here in the summer of 2020 and Trumps decision to send federal forces into the city made Portland a mainstream media story. Much of the coverage fixated on vandalism committed by the most extreme of Portlands activists. In an article in Forbes in January, a consultant who lives in a wealthy suburb likened Portland to Pompeii, contending that violence and vandalism were pushing the city toward death. A local news anchor who also lives outside the city wrote9 that it has become the city of trash and filth. New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, who is considering a run for Oregon governor, decried10 a lack of law and order in the city.11 In May, The Oregonian published the results of a poll of metro area residents and their views on downtown Portland. Destroyed, trashed, riots, and homelessness were some of the words frequently used, according to the main story11. Yet 45 percent of the respondents hadnt been downtown at all since the onset of the pandemic, suggesting that what was driving many of these opinions was not experience but media coverage. I just have no sympathy for people who speak with visceral disgust about the city. Its human people who are really struggling, and you havent even actually seen them, said Lisa Bates, associate professor of urban studies at Portland State University, which is located downtown. Of polls like The Oregonians, Bates said, Youve basically tested your own coverage. Your sensational coverage has caused people to think that its a wasteland and yet has done very little to drive the alleviation of real suffering. Notably, 83 percent of respondents in that poll said they felt safe in their own neighborhoods.12 Relentless media scrutiny led to finger-pointing, and politicians and business leaders found a convenient scapegoat for Portlands struggles in the relatively small group of activists who continued to protest this spring, often destroying property. In April, after several buildings, including a church, the Oregon Historical Society, and the home of the Blazers Boys amp38 Girls Club, were vandalized and a police union hall was set on fire, Wheeler called on citizens to take the city back from anarchists who want to burn, they want to bash, they want to intimidate, they want to assault.13 The following month, four city power brokers, including the real estate mogul and philanthropist Jordan Schnitzer, met with Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt at a private club downtown and pressed him12 to prosecute protest-related crimes more aggressively. Schmidt, who campaigned as a criminal justice reformer and won more than 75 percent of the vote, had declined to file charges for some low-level offenses like disorderly conduct, arguing they take resources from higher-level prosecutions. I dont want to be arrogant and talk on behalf of 2 million people in the metro area, Schnitzer told The Oregonian, but I cant imagine anyone not being concerned about how long the protests have gone on.14 There has been genuine debate among Black organizers and community leaders about protest tactics and the extent to which activists with an antiestablishment agenda and a penchant for property destruction undermined a more focused racial justice movement. At the same time, focusing attention on a small group of activists helped elected officials and police leadership avoid questions about their own commitment to addressing the racial injustices that gave rise to the demonstrations in the first place. Policing has long been a visible expression of inequity in Portland, but its hardly the only one. Oregon was founded as a whites-only state, and in the early 1900s Ku Klux Klan members were prevalent in the state legislature. Redlining forced Black residents into neighborhoods in Northeast and North Portland that were heavily policed and later damaged by urban renewal projects. Today, white families in Portland make more than twice13 what Black families do, while the school district suspends and expels Black students four to five times more often than white students. Once you start peeling back the realities, said Donovan Smith, a vice chair of the Portland chapter of the NAACP, this has been a state that has been so hostile towards Black people, and there should be anger from a lot of people.15 Means of survival Homelessness in Portland has become far more visible since the pandemic began. The city has created safe rest villages in response. AP Craig Mitchelldyer FROM Zo Carpenter14 Efforts to reimagine public safety in Portland have been made more complicated by an increase in gun-related crimes, a trend that predates the citys modest steps toward police reform. As of August 9, there had been 717 shooting incidents since the beginning of the year, leaving more than 50 people dead and putting Portland alongside dozens of other cities nationwide that have experienced an uptick in gun violence. Records15 obtained by Willamette Week show that Black Portlanders have been killed and injured in shootings at a rate 12 times that of white residents.16 One of the most alarming shootings occurred in July at a collection of food carts downtown, when six people were injured and a teenager named Makayla Maree Harris was killed. Hours later, Wheeler and Chuck Lovell, the chief of police, spoke with reporters by video conference. Last year, in explaining his support for modest cuts to the Portland Police Bureaus budget15 million out of 248.3 millionWheeler spoke of his duty to evolve as a leader and to fundamentally rethink what safety means in this community. But in recent months, he has called for directing more money to the bureau, citing the shootings and complaints about low staffing, high workload, and burnout. I will fight for additional resources for the police bureau, I will fight for more police officers, and I will fight for more tools and whatever other support the police bureau needs to be able to get its job done, he said during the press conference. Lovell has asked for a 40 to 50 percent staffing increase. The Portland Police Bureau declined to comment. Wheeler was not available for an interview.17 Earlier this year, Wheeler essentially reinstated the disbanded16 Gun Violence Reduction Team, which had stopped Black drivers disproportionately and had shown little evidence of effectiveness, under two new names the Enhanced Community Safety Team, a unit of 21 officers assigned to investigate gun crimes after the fact, and the Focused Intervention Team, a group of 12 tasked with proactive enforcement. Wheeler has insisted that the FIT is different from previous iterations of the gun violence unit because it will work with a community oversight group responsible for analyzing its impact on communities of color. But after a shooting in May, Wheeler sent a text to Lovell authorizing him to deploy the focused intervention team without the community oversight panel. The text, as reported17 by Oregon Public Broadcasting, continued, Do so ASAP. I am prepared to take the political heat internally including resignation. Deploy the team.18 Its insulting in a lot of ways, said Smith of the NAACP, which opposed the new units. Its a mind trip to have this person on the podium saying theyre listening when we have heard so much of the city say, Do not put more money into the cops in that way.19 There is no consensus about whats driving the increase in shootings across the country. Thats partly because the research is in the early stages and data is lacking, said Jonathan Jay, an assistant professor at the Boston University School of Public Health. But Jay and other experts suspect that the economic, social, and psychological disruptions caused by Covid-19 are significant factors. We know that the pandemic created changes in all of the social determinants of violence. There were spikes in poverty, unemployment, food insecurity, all of those drivers of stress at the community level, he said. They hit particularly hard in the places and the communities that have been most disinvested from and therefore were more vulnerable to gun violence incidents.20 While downtown Portland has received most of the recent media attention, its not where most of the shootings are occurring. Portland is bisected by Burnside Street, which runs from the mansions and lush trails of Northwest, skirting Powells bookstore and the sleek condo buildings of the Pearl District before hitting Old Town, where club-goers from the suburbs step around tents and people sleeping in doorways, then across the Willamette River, through the hedges and big houses of Laurelhurst and out past 82nd Avenue into sprawling East Portland, an area sometimes called the Numbers. Here the city flattens into strip malls, car lots, low-cost apartment buildings, and single-story ranch homes sidewalks peter out and some roads remain unpaved. East Portland does not have the twee feeling of Portlandia. Annexed in the 1980s, this area is where many people searching for affordable housing have moved as prices went up in inner neighborhoods like the Albina district, where many Black Portlanders historically lived. East Portland is far more diverse than most other parts of the city, and it has a high rate of poverty. Its also suffering disproportionately from the shootings.21 Whether more police would help is a matter of fierce debate. Hardesty and other critics of the bureau argue that it has plenty of resources that the Gun Violence Task Force proved ineffective in the past, with shootings and homicides staying steady or increasing during its operation, according to Oregon Public Broadcasting and that resources should instead be directed toward the social and economic drivers of violence, along with trauma-informed interventions led by community members. We have historical underinvestment in Black communities in Portland, and gun violence is the result of it, said Lakayana Drury, a former schoolteacher and the founder of Word Is Bond18, a local organization that runs leadership development programs for young Black men.22 Portland has made some investments in community-based violence prevention programs, including an emergency budget package passed in April that included 4.1 million in grants for groups working with affected communities. But the money was distributed slowly19, and some Portlanders in those communities say the emphasis is still on the tried-and-failed responses developed by consultants, politicians, and police. How could you talk about reducing gun violence without gun shooters in the room? asked Lionel Irving, a former gang member who works on violence prevention. Both Irving and Drury serve on the FIT oversight panel. He noted that its hard to get funding for interventions that achieve less obvious wins, such as making sure a young person whos just lost a close friend in a shooting gets home by 10 pm. If you want to stop the retaliation, get in there and deal with some of that trauma.23 Demanding change Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty has led the Portland City Councils efforts to reform the police department. Mason Trinca  Getty Images Efforts to reform the Portland police go back decades. In 1970, the Portland chapter20 of the Black Panther Party tried to get a petition on the ballot to put the police bureau under community control. But their signature-gathering effort was interrupted when police shot a man named Albert Williams at the chapters office, an incident that generated significant negative media coverage for the party. The police kept hitting us and hitting us, said Ford, the chapters founder. They put the community control thing on to simmer.24 On the 12th of every month, Ford attends a vigil for a man named Keaton Otis21, one of a number of Black residents killed by police officers who never faced legal consequences. In 2010, police pulled Otis over for failing to use a turn signal. When an officer tried to remove him from his car, Otis shot him in the leg. Police fired 23 rounds in return, killing him. Otis had a mental illness, which is a common element in many Portland police killings. The police bureau has been under the supervision of the Justice Department since 2014, after federal investigators found a pattern of excessive force against people with mental illness.25 The brutality of the Portland Police Bureau and its lack of accountability became particularly apparent during the nightly protests last year and their aftermath. The citys police oversight board, the Independent Police Review, received nearly 4,000 complaints22 about police conduct since the beginning of the protests, during which the police documented some 6,000 uses of force, including firing impact munitions and deploying tear gas. In February, the Justice Department rebuked officers for using force indiscriminately. The terms agreed to in the 2014 settlement required the bureau to conduct an assessment of its handling of the protests. In May, the Justice Department slammed the bureaus self-assessment as an advocacy piece to justify what PPB did, blame shortcomings on other entities and circumstances beyond PPBs control, and seek additional funds for new equipment, training, and personnel.26 A number of protest-related lawsuits have been filed against the city, including by a nurse who was allegedly tackled while he worked as a medic a resident who was allegedly beaten after going outside to talk to police about tear gas entering his home and by two protesters and the police reform group Dont Shoot PDX for the bureaus indiscriminate use of tear gas. So far only a single officer has been indicted in connection with the protests. In June, Officer Corey Budworth, who was a member of a unit called the Rapid Response Team that had been dispatched to the protests, was charged23 with one count of assault in the fourth degree for hitting a photographer with a baton in August of 2020. All of the remaining officers of the Rapid Response Team resigned from the unit in what was widely seen as an act of protest.27 The bureaus treatment of Black Lives Matter demonstrators is often contrasted with its handling of incursions by far-right militias. In August, police were notably absent when far-right activists, including members of the Proud Boys, came to East Portland for a rally and clashed with antifascists in brawls featuring baseball bats, paintball guns, and chemical spray. Late in the day, a man fired several shots downtown he was later arrested24.28 Police here are just not used to being held accountable, frankly, and so it creates a culture of Theyre right and everyone else is wrong. And that shows up in the way they police the neighborhoods, said Candace Avalos, chair of the Citizen Review Committee, which hears appeals of cases of alleged police misconduct. Systems of oversight are weak, particularly compared with the power wielded by the Portland Police Association, the union that represents officers of the police bureau. The CRC, for instance, has no subpoena power. Six members of the CRC have resigned since December 2019, several citing Wheelers lack of support.29 The new oversight board could correct some of this imbalance. It will be the most powerful citizen-run police accountability panel in the country25, with subpoena and firing power. Implementing it will take more than a year a commission has recently begun work to hash out the boards structure. We get one chance to do it right, said Commissioner Hardesty.30 Whose protest? Groups of far-right activists, including the Proud Boys, pictured here, regularly descended on Portland to clash with antifascists. AP  Noah Berger Portland police officers have killed two people so far this year, both of whom were in a mental health crisis. Grand juries declined to file charges against the officers in both cases. These kinds of incidents are what motivated the creation of Portland Street Response26 PSR, which rolled out its pilot program in February in the Lents neighborhood, an underserved area with a high volume of 911 and nuisance calls. The team consists of a firefighter EMT, a licensed mental-health-crisis therapist, and two community health workers who are embedded in the fire department. The goal is to create an alternative emergency response for incidents involving mental health crises or homelessness, which currently consume a sizable chunk of police resources. Half of the arrests made by Portland police in 2017 were of people experiencing homelessness. Oregon has notoriously poor mental health care services, ranking 48th in prevalence of mental illness and access to care, according to one study.31 But the pilots scope is limited. Currently PSR operates only in Lents, and the team is permitted to independently handle only incidents that do not involve a suicide risk or a weapon and that occur in publicly accessible spaces such as stores or lobbies. Because of these limitations, call volume has been lower than expected. In May, three of the citys five commissioners voted against27 Hardestys proposal to allocate 3.6 million to expand the program into other neighborhoods next spring. Wheeler said he supported the pilot but wanted to see outcomes before expanding it more recently, he said he was working with Hardesty on an expansion. In June, PSR asked the city for permission to respond to calls from private spaces such as homes, hotels, and shelters. The Portland Police Association, which has bargaining rights over PSR expansions, denied the request.32 The pilot is one of the few concrete steps Portland has taken to reimagine public safety since George Floyds death, though it was in the works years earlier. That, combined with the ongoing political wrangling, has put a tremendous amount of pressure on the programs small team of first responders. Its been really, really stressful, said Britt Urban, the teams crisis therapist. I love the work. I love what were doing when were out meeting with people. But then on top of that you have all this chatter and media scrutiny. While the program is often described in the media as an opposing force to the police, its staff works closely with the bureau, and many of the emergency dispatchers who assign calls to PSR are members of the union. Robyn Burek, a program manager, described this collaboration as helpful. Given the unions veto power, it is also a necessity. Now that the team has been blocked from independently responding to homes and other private spaces, for instance, PSR can maintain its limited mission, or try to co-respond more frequently with officers.33 One of chief drivers of the backlash against police reform is concern about homelessness and related public safety issues, a debate that Portland Street Response is also wrapped up in. Some who request the teams services want it to clear homeless encampments, which is not part of its mission. There tends to be these two communities, said Burek. One community wants this alternative to police response, and another community, largely people who live in residences near homeless camps, wants more of an enforcement.34 Homelessness is one of Portlands most divisive, complex issues. Its often chalked up to the city offering generous services to houseless individuals. However, research indicates that housing unaffordability is a more significant driver of homelessness. Between 2012 and 2017, rents in Portland rose faster than income, while home prices jumped28 citywide by over 88,000 between 2014 and 2019. Today, 46 percent of renters in the greater Portland region spend more than 30 percent of their income on rent.35 According to city officials, there were about six large encampments in Portland before the pandemic as of June, they numbered more than 100. Tents and other structures dot sidewalks, green spaces, and the shoulders of exit ramps throughout the city. During the past year, the Homelessness and Urban Camping Impact Reduction Program was receiving a record 1,700 complaints about encampments each week, according to The Washington Post. People typically assume because homelessness is more visible, rates of homelessness have gone up, said Greg Townley, research director at Portland State Universitys Homelessness Research amp38 Action Collaborative29. Such a rise may be looming as eviction moratoriums end, Townley noted, but the visibility of the thousands of people living without housing mostly reflects the fact that Portland paused what had amounted to dozens of weekly sweeps of encampments after the CDC recommended that people be allowed to shelter in place.36 Portland has resumed some sweeps, which the city calls clean-ups. Some residents feel that removals arent happening fast enough, while others argue that they are an inhumane measure that prioritizes aesthetics over the well-being of unhoused people, who often lose their belongings in the process. Sweeps are not an approach that has been shown to effectively address the issue that were facing in terms of housing shortages, Townley said. All it is is moving people along.37 Some other new initiatives offer medium- and long-term solutions. County and city officials have united around a plan to create six safe rest villages, designated parking or camping sites that will offer hygiene services and case management. These may provide some immediate safe shelter, but they dont solve the underlying issue of housing affordability. Last year, voters approved a quarter-billion-dollar measure30 to fund permanent supportive housing, and the City Council enacted a significant zoning reform that will permit multi-unit homes in residential lots, a plan that housing experts believe may eventually help lower housing costs across the city.38 Portlands racial justice protests were driven by the fraught history of racism and policing in the city and its deeply rooted tradition of radical activism. But they also emerged in the context of Portlands recent transformation from an under-the-radar, affordable city into a national tourist and business destination with snarls of traffic and block-long lines for famous ice cream, where the cost of rent was for a time rising faster than almost anywhere else in the country. This transformation is neatly expressed in the new Ritz-Carlton under construction downtown. Its lower facade is now in place, a skeleton of pale, asymmetric blocks stacked like bones. Invitations sent out recently to potential investors described the tower as a response to the rapid proliferation of commerce and affluence in Portland.39 Ultimately, the protests became a lightning rod for more expansive anxieties about the trajectory of the city and who wields power here. Before the pandemic, the city government was taking tentative steps to address equity in its planning decisions and to stop the displacement of vulnerable residents in gentrifying neighborhoods. Lisa Bates, of Portland State, believes that some of the backlash from the business community to the protests is really a very explicit rebuke of the idea of placing equitable development at the core of decision-making.40 The conversation about the citys major issues is, in my view, reprehensibly putting the blame on poor people, Black people, and allies of Black civil rights for essentially every ill thats happening in the city right now, Bates continued. The result is a narrative that insists the only way we can save us is more cops get out of the way of my development juice at the top so high-income tourists come back. To acknowledge that Portlands greatest challenges have little to do with anarchists would mean having a more difficult conversation about the citys future. It would mean asking, Who is this city for?41  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12 textIn20addition20to20Schnitzer2C20Mason20and20Margulis2C20Henry20Hillman20Jr.20also20joined20the20later20luncheon.20Hillman20is20the20scion20of20a20Pittsburgh20steel20fortune20and20longtime20Portland20entrepreneur  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30","homeless, homelessness, affordable housing, unhoused, houseless"

VETERAN VILLAGE KINS COMMUNITIES The companys 500-acre strategic growing partner Veteran Village Kins Community in Golden Valley, Arizona, is also designed to grow hemp and produce CBD products to benefit veterans as well as generate revenue for Hemp, Inc., the Veteran Village and individual veterans living in the community. Hemp, Inc. executives are also continuing to scout new locations nationwide to open additional hemp processing centers in legal markets. For a more complete description on the Veteran Village Kins Community as mentioned above, read the following October 24, 2017 press release, Hemp, Inc. Announces Strategic Hemp Growing Partner Veteran Village Kins Community Arizona, Inc. Completes Final Site Plan Blueprints, below Hemp, Inc. has announced that its strategic growing partner, Veteran Village Kins Community Arizona, Inc., has completed its final site plan blueprints for its 500-acre site in Golden Valley, Arizona 20 miles north of Kingman, AZ and 90 minutes from Las Vegas, NV. The site plan was submitted to the Mohave County Building Department for final review. The Company is also in the final stages of completing the necessary infrastructure to support an off-grid, renewable, energy system. With the solar equipment in place, the sites solar power operation will be completed in the next days. As soon as the live streaming video cameras are up and operational, the world can actually see the way the Veteran Village Kins Community is designed and watch it being built. According to Perlowin, the basic framework or overall plan of the Veteran Village Kins Communities is to create a holistic healing and learning center that is designed to educate and heal veterans with PTSD, alcoholism, meth addiction, opioid addiction, and other psychological conditions while at the same time training them on the numerous aspects of being part of the emerging multi-billion dollar hemp industry. We will also be building hemp-growing communities for other groups such as Abused Women Children Village Kins Communities, the Orphaned Children Village Kins Communities, Homeless Village Kins Communities, and the Healers Village Kins Communities the healers are professionals who are knowledgeable in the modalities to treat these traumatized groups. These particular communities are all synergistically aligned to work simultaneously supporting each other. For example, the Healers heal the traumatized veterans and women children the women support orphan children, and orphan children want to see people living in homes and not homeless. Thus, a portion of the hemp grown in each community goes to create and support another community, giving everybody a sense of giving back and helping others as they help themselves. This circles back to the healers who also work to heal the veterans and the other traumatized groups. This is the economic foundation on how the sale of the hemp products operates as a quantum economic matrix or an example of symbiotic economics which is more complex than this brief description allows. Dwight Jory, the Project Manager for the Veteran Village Kins Community Arizona, Inc., said, We are very happy with the progress. Our Kins Community is really beginning to come together. In anticipation of planting to begin during the spring, 300 acres have been fenced, 16 overnight trailer park sites are under construction, and six 4040-ft organic vegetable gardens have been planted and are currently producing food and kenaf, according to Jory. These organic gardens double as experimental growing modules using an entire array of different growing technologies to see which modalities grow the best in a desert environment. As for the 6 geodesic domes mentioned in an earlier press release, 1 is structurally complete with only the electrical and plumbing to be completed. The rest are on site awaiting final site plan approval. We are now accepting volunteers who have expressed an interest in helping to build the first Kins Community for our veterans, said Jory. Those interested in making the first hemp growing CBD-producing Veteran Village Kins Community become a reality should contact Ms. Sandra Williams via email . One thousand trees, on 36 of the 500-acres, have also been planted, with an additional 1,000 trees on order. The Veteran Village Kins Community will include a 100,000-square foot GMP compliant, central processing plant, a state-of-the-art testing laboratory, and various health and wellness centers to support veterans who may have psychological, emotional or health issues. As Hemp, Inc. positions itself on the forefront of Americas industrial hemp revolution, we see our partnership with Veteran Village Kins Community Arizona, Inc. being paramount in supporting the small family farm movement that we are confident will reshape the American landscape, said Perlowin. As we work toward getting our eco-village up and running in Arizona, we are also aggressively scouting strategic locations in other states including North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Tennessee and West Virginia. Giving veterans and other Americans a place to learn new skills and take part in this multi-billion-dollar hemp CBD market is very exciting. Its a big part of our mission to give back. Recently we have expanded our Kins Community concept internationally focusing, but not limited to, Israel, New Zealand, Canada, Africa, and Uruguay. According to Perlowin, we hope to have 50 master hemp growers working on their first Veteran Village Kins Community in Arizona. To date, we have growers from Oregon, Colorado, California, Kentucky, North Carolina, Nevada, Florida, and Arizona who have expressed an interest in pursuing a joint venture with Hemp, Inc. to each grow industrial hemp on 5 of the 300 fenced acres in Arizona. Perlowin says hell call this The Great United American Hemp Grow-Off. Any grower having an interest in pursuing a joint venture on 5 of the 300 fenced in acres in Arizona should contact Project Manager Dwight Jory. Or, anyone interested in attending the 2-7-day hands-on hempcrete house building should contact Dwight Jory  as well. The Grow-Off starts June 1, 2019 the first day hemp will be legal to grow in Arizona and also includes a Hemp University every weekend for the entire growing season. The Hemp University in Arizona will be held in a 60-foot geodesic dome. WHAT IS HEMP? Hemp is a durable natural fiber that is grown as a renewable source for raw materials that can be incorporated into thousands of products. Its one of the oldest domesticated crops known to man. Hemp is used in nutritional food products such as hemp seeds, hemp hearts and hemp proteins, for humans. It is also used in building materials, paper, textiles, cordage, organic body care and other nutraceuticals, just to name a few. It has thousands of other known uses. A hemp crop requires half the water alfalfa uses and can be grown without the heavy use of pesticides. Farmers worldwide grow hemp commercially for fiber, seed, and oil for use in a variety of industrial and consumer products. The United States is the only developed nation that fails to cultivate industrial hemp as an economic crop on a large scale, according to the Congressional Resource Service. However, with rapidly changing laws and more states gravitating towards industrial hemp and passing an industrial hemp bill, that could change. Currently, the majority of hemp sold in the United States is imported from China and Canada, the worlds largest exporters of the industrial hemp crop.

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HEMP AND MARIJUANA Hemp is completely different from marijuana in its function, cultivation and application. In cultivating marijuana, the plants are spaced far apart, and the male plants are destroyed to assure that they cannot seed the female plants, which would result in undesirable, less potent and less marketable, seeded marijuana buds. Hemp, on the other hand, is planted close together and commonly hermaphrodites, which creates an abundance of seeds, the main component of Hemp foods and supplements. The Hemp stalks are processed and used for fiber, composite, and other hemp based end products. Hemp is used in variety of other applications that marijuana couldnt possibly be used in. These include healthy dietary supplements, skin products, clothing, and accessories. Overall, hemp is known to have over 25,000 possible applications . Hemp products such as Hemp Milk, Hemp Cereal, and Hemp Oil are used by consumers every day. For an excellent read on the difference between hemp and marijuana, visit the Ministry of Hemp . 9 GREAT REASONS TO INCLUDE HEMP AS PART OF A HEALTHY DIET  Source  Although hemp seeds come from the Cannabis sativa plant, they do not produce a mind-altering effect. These small, brown seeds are rich in protein, fiber, and healthful fatty acids, including omega-3s and omega-6s. They have antioxidant effects and may reduce symptoms of numerous ailments, improving the health of the heart, skin, and joints. Read all the reasons to include hemp as part of a healthy diet here . HOW HEMP CAN CHANGE THE WORLD Fiber - Hemp fiber can be used to make fabrics and textiles, rope and paper. The word canvas actually derives from the word cannabis. Fuel - While the industrial, medicinal and commercial properties of hemp have been known to mankind for a very long time, its benefits to the environment have just been realized in recent years. One of the compelling things hemp offers is fuel. With reserves of petroleum being depleted, it would be nice if we could have a fuel source which was reusable and which we could grow right here, making us completely energy independent. Food - Hemp seeds are very nutritious and were first thought to be eaten by the Ancient Chinese and Indians. Hemp seeds have a nutty taste and can be eaten raw, ground up, sprouted, or made into dried sprout powder. Hemp seeds also contain a very beneficial oil that is high in unsaturated fatty acids, including an optimal 14 ratio of omega-3 to 6. Building Material - Hemp can be made into a variety of building materials. These include concrete-like blocks called hempcrete, biodegradable plastics, and wood replacements. These materials have been used in the manufacture of many things, including electronics, cars and houses. In fact, the first American home made of hemp-based materials was completed in August 2010 in Asheville, North Carolina. Biofuel - Remarkably, the oil from hemp seeds and stalks can also be made into biofuels such as Biodiesel??sometimes known as hempoline. While this biofuel can be used to power engines, it does take quite a lot of raw material to produce a substantial amount.

Wisconsin Teacher Put on Leave After Verbally-Abusing Maskless Student66 Amid all the confusing guidance spewed by the CDC, NIH, and the Administration from Fauci, Walensky, Biden, Psaki etc in the last two weeks, one teachers verbally-abusive rage against a maskless student in her class sums up the nations science-denying masked or unmasked?, virtue-signalers ongoing cognitive dissonance as the pandemic that gave many of them purpose in life is quickly fading from top of mind.

The speaker told protesters that the first protest in Bellevue Park was sensationalized in the media, with the mayor advising people not to attend. But there are people out there, he said, who can think for themselves.

AMI executive director Shahid Rahman introduced the panel by claiming that during Ramadan we have seen our Muslim-American community live up to their reputation as the most charitable of people. Yet a 2019 Philanthropy Roundtable study found that Mormons are the most generous Americans . . . Evangelical Christians are next. Then come mainline Protestants. Catholics lag both. Muslim scholars who studied Muslim-American philanthropy in 2018 found that U.S. Muslim giving to religious causes and institutions is far behind that of other U.S. religious groups.81 Man Dressed as Street Medic During Detroit Protests Charged With Pointing Laser at Police Helicopter82 A dangerous incident involving the Detroit police helicopter could have been much worse last summer during a BLM protest.83 Muslim Brotherhood Praises Dems for Abandoning Israel in Time of War84 The Muslim Brotherhoods official online mouthpiece offered praise this week to Democratic members of Congress who are publicly criticizing Israel as it defends itself against an onslaught of terrorist rockets.

Nenshi is the first Muslim to be mayor of a major Canadian city. Canada is hyper-sensitive, under Justin Trudeaus government, of offending Muslims. To ask questions, to point out that jihad terror and other human rights abuses are sanctioned in Islamic law, earns you the dreaded Islamophobia label, which comes in Canada with possible punitive action.109 Halifax Police Make Arrests for Illegal Gatherings Following Court Injunction110 Halifax Regional Police have issued 21 tickets under the Health Protection Act and made multiple arrests following what they say were two separate illegal gatherings in Halifax, one day after a Nova Scotia Supreme Court justice issued a temporary injunction to stop a weekend anti-mask rally in the city.

Meanwhile, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights warned that attacks being carried out by both sides may constitute serious violations of international humanitarian law.

In a little over one week in Burkina Faso, over 17,500 people have been forcefully displaced from their homes and 45 people murdered by expanding Islamic State and al-Qaeda jihadists. While the focus on the West remains curbing Islamophobia, the security situation in the Sahel region is fueling one of the fastest growing displacement crises in the world.

Many Muslims, joined by their liberal well-wishers, are also cursing Israel and mourning over Palestine in light of the escalating Israel-Palestine conflict. Eid, a joyous celebration in the Muslim world, follows a month-long period of fasting one can eat only from sunset to sunrise during this time known as Ramadan. During Ramadan, which Muslims consider to be a holy month, we are told that Muslims are expected to renew and redouble their efforts to follow the teachings of Islam by refraining from human vices including envy, anger, greed, lust and so on. This sounds like it could provide some relief not just for the Muslims, but for the whole world. However, there is always an upsurge in jihad terror activities and violence by Islamic groups during this time of the year, incited by exploitation of the religious sentiments of Muslims. This results in riots, bloodshed, and anarchy worldwide. The latest Israel-Gaza conflict is one of the premier examples of this. Still, one may argue that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a recurring crisis and so it would not be fair to link it with Ramadan. So lets look at other instances.181 Hundreds Gather for Anti-Lockdown Protest in Victoria Park182 LONDON, ONT.

VETERAN VILLAGE KINS COMMUNITIES The companys 500-acre strategic growing partner Veteran Village Kins Community in Golden Valley, Arizona, is also designed to grow hemp and produce CBD products to benefit veterans as well as generate revenue for Hemp, Inc., the Veteran Village and individual veterans living in the community. Hemp, Inc. executives are also continuing to scout new locations nationwide to open additional hemp processing centers in legal markets. For a more complete description on the Veteran Village Kins Community as mentioned above, read the following October 24, 2017 press release, Hemp, Inc. Announces Strategic Hemp Growing Partner Veteran Village Kins Community Arizona, Inc. Completes Final Site Plan Blueprints, below Hemp, Inc. has announced that its strategic growing partner, Veteran Village Kins Community Arizona, Inc., has completed its final site plan blueprints for its 500-acre site in Golden Valley, Arizona 20 miles north of Kingman, AZ and 90 minutes from Las Vegas, NV. The site plan was submitted to the Mohave County Building Department for final review. The Company is also in the final stages of completing the necessary infrastructure to support an off-grid, renewable, energy system. With the solar equipment in place, the sites solar power operation will be completed in the next days. As soon as the live streaming video cameras are up and operational, the world can actually see the way the Veteran Village Kins Community is designed and watch it being built. According to Perlowin, the basic framework or overall plan of the Veteran Village Kins Communities is to create a holistic healing and learning center that is designed to educate and heal veterans with PTSD, alcoholism, meth addiction, opioid addiction, and other psychological conditions while at the same time training them on the numerous aspects of being part of the emerging multi-billion dollar hemp industry. We will also be building hemp-growing communities for other groups such as Abused Women Children Village Kins Communities, the Orphaned Children Village Kins Communities, Homeless Village Kins Communities, and the Healers Village Kins Communities the healers are professionals who are knowledgeable in the modalities to treat these traumatized groups. These particular communities are all synergistically aligned to work simultaneously supporting each other. For example, the Healers heal the traumatized veterans and women children the women support orphan children, and orphan children want to see people living in homes and not homeless. Thus, a portion of the hemp grown in each community goes to create and support another community, giving everybody a sense of giving back and helping others as they help themselves. This circles back to the healers who also work to heal the veterans and the other traumatized groups. This is the economic foundation on how the sale of the hemp products operates as a quantum economic matrix or an example of symbiotic economics which is more complex than this brief description allows. Dwight Jory, the Project Manager for the Veteran Village Kins Community Arizona, Inc., said, We are very happy with the progress. Our Kins Community is really beginning to come together. In anticipation of planting to begin during the spring, 300 acres have been fenced, 16 overnight trailer park sites are under construction, and six 4040-ft organic vegetable gardens have been planted and are currently producing food and kenaf, according to Jory. These organic gardens double as experimental growing modules using an entire array of different growing technologies to see which modalities grow the best in a desert environment. As for the 6 geodesic domes mentioned in an earlier press release, 1 is structurally complete with only the electrical and plumbing to be completed. The rest are on site awaiting final site plan approval. We are now accepting volunteers who have expressed an interest in helping to build the first Kins Community for our veterans, said Jory. Those interested in making the first hemp growing CBD-producing Veteran Village Kins Community become a reality should contact Ms. Sandra Williams via email . One thousand trees, on 36 of the 500-acres, have also been planted, with an additional 1,000 trees on order. The Veteran Village Kins Community will include a 100,000-square foot GMP compliant, central processing plant, a state-of-the-art testing laboratory, and various health and wellness centers to support veterans who may have psychological, emotional or health issues. As Hemp, Inc. positions itself on the forefront of Americas industrial hemp revolution, we see our partnership with Veteran Village Kins Community Arizona, Inc. being paramount in supporting the small family farm movement that we are confident will reshape the American landscape, said Perlowin. As we work toward getting our eco-village up and running in Arizona, we are also aggressively scouting strategic locations in other states including North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Tennessee and West Virginia. Giving veterans and other Americans a place to learn new skills and take part in this multi-billion-dollar hemp CBD market is very exciting. Its a big part of our mission to give back. Recently we have expanded our Kins Community concept internationally focusing, but not limited to, Israel, New Zealand, Canada, Africa, and Uruguay. According to Perlowin, we hope to have 50 master hemp growers working on their first Veteran Village Kins Community in Arizona. To date, we have growers from Oregon, Colorado, California, Kentucky, North Carolina, Nevada, Florida, and Arizona who have expressed an interest in pursuing a joint venture with Hemp, Inc. to each grow industrial hemp on 5 of the 300 fenced acres in Arizona. Perlowin says hell call this The Great United American Hemp Grow-Off. Any grower having an interest in pursuing a joint venture on 5 of the 300 fenced in acres in Arizona should contact Project Manager Dwight Jory. Or, anyone interested in attending the 2-7-day hands-on hempcrete house building should contact Dwight Jory  as well. The Grow-Off starts June 1, 2019 the first day hemp will be legal to grow in Arizona and also includes a Hemp University every weekend for the entire growing season. The Hemp University in Arizona will be held in a 60-foot geodesic dome. WHAT IS HEMP? Hemp is a durable natural fiber that is grown as a renewable source for raw materials that can be incorporated into thousands of products. Its one of the oldest domesticated crops known to man. Hemp is used in nutritional food products such as hemp seeds, hemp hearts and hemp proteins, for humans. It is also used in building materials, paper, textiles, cordage, organic body care and other nutraceuticals, just to name a few. It has thousands of other known uses. A hemp crop requires half the water alfalfa uses and can be grown without the heavy use of pesticides. Farmers worldwide grow hemp commercially for fiber, seed, and oil for use in a variety of industrial and consumer products. The United States is the only developed nation that fails to cultivate industrial hemp as an economic crop on a large scale, according to the Congressional Resource Service. However, with rapidly changing laws and more states gravitating towards industrial hemp and passing an industrial hemp bill, that could change. Currently, the majority of hemp sold in the United States is imported from China and Canada, the worlds largest exporters of the industrial hemp crop.

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HEMP AND MARIJUANA Hemp is completely different from marijuana in its function, cultivation and application. In cultivating marijuana, the plants are spaced far apart, and the male plants are destroyed to assure that they cannot seed the female plants, which would result in undesirable, less potent and less marketable, seeded marijuana buds. Hemp, on the other hand, is planted close together and commonly hermaphrodites, which creates an abundance of seeds, the main component of Hemp foods and supplements. The Hemp stalks are processed and used for fiber, composite, and other hemp based end products. Hemp is used in variety of other applications that marijuana couldnt possibly be used in. These include healthy dietary supplements, skin products, clothing, and accessories. Overall, hemp is known to have over 25,000 possible applications . Hemp products such as Hemp Milk, Hemp Cereal, and Hemp Oil are used by consumers every day. For an excellent read on the difference between hemp and marijuana, visit the Ministry of Hemp . 9 GREAT REASONS TO INCLUDE HEMP AS PART OF A HEALTHY DIET  Source  Although hemp seeds come from the Cannabis sativa plant, they do not produce a mind-altering effect. These small, brown seeds are rich in protein, fiber, and healthful fatty acids, including omega-3s and omega-6s. They have antioxidant effects and may reduce symptoms of numerous ailments, improving the health of the heart, skin, and joints. Read all the reasons to include hemp as part of a healthy diet here . HOW HEMP CAN CHANGE THE WORLD Fiber - Hemp fiber can be used to make fabrics and textiles, rope and paper. The word canvas actually derives from the word cannabis. Fuel - While the industrial, medicinal and commercial properties of hemp have been known to mankind for a very long time, its benefits to the environment have just been realized in recent years. One of the compelling things hemp offers is fuel. With reserves of petroleum being depleted, it would be nice if we could have a fuel source which was reusable and which we could grow right here, making us completely energy independent. Food - Hemp seeds are very nutritious and were first thought to be eaten by the Ancient Chinese and Indians. Hemp seeds have a nutty taste and can be eaten raw, ground up, sprouted, or made into dried sprout powder. Hemp seeds also contain a very beneficial oil that is high in unsaturated fatty acids, including an optimal 14 ratio of omega-3 to 6. Building Material - Hemp can be made into a variety of building materials. These include concrete-like blocks called hempcrete, biodegradable plastics, and wood replacements. These materials have been used in the manufacture of many things, including electronics, cars and houses. In fact, the first American home made of hemp-based materials was completed in August 2010 in Asheville, North Carolina. Biofuel - Remarkably, the oil from hemp seeds and stalks can also be made into biofuels such as Biodiesel??sometimes known as hempoline. While this biofuel can be used to power engines, it does take quite a lot of raw material to produce a substantial amount.

HEMP, INC.S TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE With a deep-rooted social and environmental mission at its core, Hemp, Inc. seeks to build a business constituency for the American small farmer, the American veteran, and other groups experiencing the ever-increasing disparity between tapering income and soaring expenses.

The State of Minnesota, UMN President Joan Gabel, and the Board of Regents need to understand that if our brothers and sisters at the university are forced to strike, the Teamsters are ready to take up this fight, no matter the cost. The protesting service workers were joined by student and environmental groups, faculty members, community leaders and elected officials, including Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman. Local 320 represents 1,500 workers at UMN who clean buildings, service dormitories, maintain grounds, prepare food, maintain HVAC systems, care for research animals, drive trucks, and perform other activities across the universitys five campuses.

Michelle Lujan Grisham on Monday pardoned six people for convictions ranging from fraud and larceny to burglary and drug trafficking. The pardons represent another round of clemency decisions for the first-term Democratic governor who is seeking reelection. She has pardoned 56 people overall. The governors office said nearly all of the pardoned offenses stem from crimes committed a decade or more ago, and all but one involved nonviolent offenses. Among those pardoned was Cynthia Jaramillo, who escaped from serial killer David Parker Ray in 1999. The governors office said Jaramillo, who had a drug trafficking conviction on her record, has since dedicated her life to supporting women facing homelessness and addiction. The others were Bridgette Yvette Tabor, Jack Ferguson, Travis Earl Gatling, Randall E. Johnston and Kathleen Woerter. The governors pardoning power extends to all crimes committed under state law except for impeachment and treason.

Compare that to 2016-2017, when the city gave RACC a grant of 4.29 million in addition to 3.3 million in arts tax money.

Our work addresses a long-standing goal in the nanoscience community to create self-assembling nanoscale machines that can perform work in conventional environments such as room temperature liquids, said research team leader Norbert F. Scherer from the University of Chicago. This type of nano-scale machinery is vital for atomic-level assembly tools.

Police responded to two shooting scenes in Northeast D.C. that left three men dead on Saturday afternoon. Police said two men were found shot in the 1700 block of Irving Street in the Brookland neighborhood at around 2 p.m. One man was found in the street, and the other was found in a yard. They were both found unconscious and not breathing, officials said. Minutes later, D.C. Police and D.C. Fire responded to a shooting on the 4500 block of Quarles Street in the Kenilworth neighborhood. A civilian drove the victim to the hospital to be treated for critical life threatening injuries, officials said.112 Should We Celebrate Halloween?113 Trick or treating is a particularly important tradition in modern times, and once again this year most people will allow their children to freely roam the streets without even stopping to consider who their children will be getting candy from. But the truth is that there are lots of predators out there. In fact, there are nearly a million registered sex offenders in the United States today, and Halloween is one of their biggest nights. According to Mike ONeal, the CEO of Keeping Kids Safe, it can be an opportunity for predators to invite small children to come back to their homes another time If you go to a predators house and he has big candy bars and he says, Listen, come back tomorrow and if I have some left over, Ill give it to you, well of course the childs gonna go, Youre gonna have candy left over and youre gonna give it to me? Sure Ill come back tomorrow, said ONeal. Do you really want to take a chance that your children could have those sorts of encounters? Other predators are seeking to lure people for other purposes. Just consider the following example  You may not be aware of the spiritual power involved in the ancient rituals that are conducted year after year, but that doesnt mean that you are immune. In a previous article, I listed 15 reasons why none of us should be celebrating the Devils holiday 1 Halloween is simply a modernized version of the Druidic festival of the dead known as Samhain. 2 Samhain is one of the most important holidays on the Wiccan wheel of the year. In other words, it is considered to be a high holy day for witches all over the globe. 3 Wiccan high priestess Doreen Valiente once made the following statement about this holiday Halloween is one of the four Great Sabbats of the witches that everyone has heard about. To witches, Halloween is a serious occasion, however merrily celebrated. It is the old Celtic Eve of Samhain. 4 Former Satanist John Ramirez says that he sacrificed animals as part of satanic rituals on Halloween, and now that he is a Christian pastor he warns people about how they can curse themselves by participating in Halloween traditions.114 Suspect Charged in Gretchen Whitmer Kidnap Plot Had Anarchist Flag, Hates Police115 Several media outlets, including the New York Times and the UK Daily Mail have attempted to cast the individuals as right-wing and Trump supporters, but at least one suspect, Brandon Caserta, held views more nuanced than that.

Dr. Michael Ryan, executive director of WHOs Health Emergencies Program, released the numbers WHO spokesperson Dr. Margaret Harris confirmed them later. Ryan expressed concern that the pandemic was still ongoing, but apparently didnt do the math when it comes to comparing COVID-19 to annual flu numbers. Put plainly, Off-Guardian explains The global population is roughly 7.8 billion people, if 10 have been infected that is 780 million cases. The global death toll currently attributed to Sars-Cov-2 infections is 1,061,539. Thats an infection fatality rate of roughly or 0.14. Right in line with seasonal flu and the predictions of many experts from all around the world. Not only that, if the true COVID numbers are as inflated as some claim, it makes COVID-19 likely even less dangerous than flu.

Dems Entitlement Mentality Extends to Governing!125 The very briefest history of communism is this It always fails, regardless of who tries it, regardless of where it is tried, and regardless of how it is tried. Every communist failure has been a human catastrophe. This happens because in the heart of communism lives a flawed view of what makes us human. Whether it was Stalins gulag, the former USSRs Siberian prison camps, or Maos Chinese communist reeducation camps, the underlying premise is the same. The minds of men and women are infinitely malleable and thus can be twisted into whatever grotesque shape the communist leadership determines is most beneficial for the new society. Oddly enough, what is most beneficial for this new communist nation is that the new communist leadership  having toppled the old democratic leadership  continue to govern forever. In practice it never works out that way, because the central communist truth about humanity is false. Men and women are not infinitely malleable in what they believe and therefore in how they act. Coercion and violence may keep them in line for several generations, but in the midst of building their impossible utopia, the glorious revolution always drowns the nation in blood. As Alexander Solzhenitsyn noted of Russian communism, All this has happened to us because we have forgotten God. If you dont understand that God has a backdoor entrance into the human mind, then you will fail to understand what is taking place all around you. God is prying open His backdoor entrance into the human mind.126 Wisconsins Absentee-Ballot Extension Shot Down by Appeals Court127 National File  Rejecting the Democrats emotional argument about voter disenfranchisement, a US Appeals Court reserved the crafting of election law to elected officials, rather than the judiciary.128 Wonder Woman Director Patty Jenkins Fears Theater Shutdown May Kill the Industry129 Wonder Woman 1984 director Patty Jenkins expressed concern about the future of cinema in the aftermath of the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic.

She then expressed that she was wary of streaming as an option for big-budget action films, It could be the kind of thing that happened to the music industry, where you could crumble the entire industry by making it something that cant be profitable. Jenkins added, I dont think any of us want to live in a world where the only option is to take your kids to watch a movie in your own living room, and not have a place to go for a date.130 It Begins Canadas First Arrest Under the Quarantine Act Sets the Stage for Aussie Like Tyranny131 By Press For Truth And so it beginsThe Canadian government is marching down the road towards tyranny with the first arrest being made under the It Begins Canadas First Arrest Under THE132 Danish Far-Right Extremist Plans to Use Swedish Citizenship for New Provocative Demos133 Rasmus Paludan, the leader of an extremist far-right party in Denmark, says he plans to travel to Sweden to carry out demonstrations after authorities confirmed he was a citizen of the country.

Some physicists have theorized that this phenomenon could enable the development of a new type of quantum technology, namely topological quantum computers.

portland,Throwing Money at Housing Won't Work,2017-12-11T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,The Oregonian,"Dec 11, 2017 The Antiplanner Delivered by Newstex Recognizing that rents are going up much faster than the incomes in places like New York and Los Angeles, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development recently told NPR1 that cities need to away from the concept that only the government can solve this problem by throwing more money at it. In response, Portlands Mayor Ted Wheeler tweeted2, Secretary Carson, if you dont think govt can provide solutions, then you should step aside and allow someone up to the task to lead. Apparently, in Oregon it is an apostasy to think that any problem cant be solved by throwing tax dollars at it. This is particularly ironic when Portland is now suffering cost overruns3 on its so-called affordable housing projects comparable to those for its light-rail projects.",affordable housing
portland,Throwing Money at Housing Won't Work,2017-12-11T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,The Oregonian,"One project that was supposed to cost 200,000 per unit is coming in at 285,000 per unit-a 42.5 percent overrun. Wheeler proudly tweeted that the city just approved another project with 203 units of so-called affordable housing. Because home prices in a market of nearly 820,000 homes are going to be significantly influenced by the subsidized construction of 203 more-Not! As the Antiplanner previously noted4, affordable housing is not the same as housing affordability. Affordable housing is government subsidized housing for people too poor to afford housing. It is not intended or expected to influence the overall housing market because it does nothing about the underlying conditions that have made housing expensive in the first place. The problem in Portland, and the entire West Coast, is that housing is unaffordable to almost everyone, not just the very poor, and the only real solution for most people is to move away. The rent steals so much of your paycheck, you might have to move back in with your parents, reflects5 the Los Angeles Times, and half your life is spent staring at the rear end of the car in front of you. This, in a nutshell, describes the Antiplanners two biggest complaints about West Coast-style urban planning that it deliberately makes housing expensive and roads congested. Of course, the Times never mentions the cause, only the results Californians are fleeing the state for more affordable and less congested places such as Las Vegas. California is nearly 95 percent rural, but the remaining 5.3 percent consists of the densest urban lands of any state in the country. This is no accident, but a result of decades of careful planning by urban planners who believe that low-density development is bad and high densities-the higher the better-are good. On average, California urban areas have more than 4,300 people per square mile, compared with less than 2,200 for urban areas in the other 49 states. California also has the least affordable housing in the country. The solution, argues6 the New York Times, is denser development. Come again? If being twice as dense as everyone else has given California the nations least affordable housing, how can more density make it more affordable? Oregon has been subject to this density mania for years. Portlands Willamette Week just did a story about six cities7 that are supposedly smarter than Portland about housing. Were they smarter by not having urban-growth boundaries? No, in most cases they were smarter, according to the newspaper, because they allowed more density. Willamette Week doesnt cite any evidence that this made them more affordable, and in fact the densest ones are pretty unaffordable. Montreal, supposedly, is smarter because it encourages row houses-a form of housing that Portland according to an August 11, 1999 article in the Oregonian that is no longer on line rejected years ago because it wasnt dense enough. According to the latest affordability data8, Montreal is much less affordable than Portland, so it is hardly a shining example. Similarly, Tokyo is supposed to be smarter because it allows taller high rises than Portland, which limits buildings to 460 feet. But if Portlands housing shortage was due to high-rise regulations, you would at least see lots of residential high rises that are close to but not over Portlands height limit. You dont. Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles all have buildings in the works that will rise higher than 1,000 feet, says the weekly. And those cities are how much more affordable than Portland? No, they are less affordable. Chicago cut red tape on new construction. While thats a good idea, the latest density data indicate that Chicagos urban densities are declining, probably because people are moving out due to high housing costs. Singapore is supposed to be smarter because it is spending gobs of money building high-density public housing. But when you are in a multi-trillion-dollar housing market, it is going to take hundreds of billions of dollars in public housing to have an effect on prices. Carson is absolutely right throwing other peoples money at the problem may be politically popular, but it doesnt solve anything. While homelessness isnt exclusively related to affordability, its no coincidence that homelessness is rising fastest9 in unaffordable areas. If cities and states would make themselves more affordable by relaxing rural land-use restrictions, the need for public housing would dramatically decline. The affordable-housing crunch is a nationwide problem, claims the above-mentioned New York Times article. Wrong again its only a problem in states that have rural land-use restrictions, which are basically the Pacific Coast states, New England to northern Virginia, and Florida. This means the solutions are very different than they would be if it were truly a national problem. Density is not the solution because land in dense areas and construction of mid-rise and high-rise housing costs more than low-rise construction in low-density areas. Those who argue for density have fallen into the trap set by urban planners of failing to look beyond urban boundaries. Oregon is 98.5 percent rural. California is 94.7 percent rural. The solution to the housing affordability issue in these states is to allow development on those rural lands. That means governments real job is to out of the way, not create more costly programs that dont work.

Our policy approach to Haiti remains deeply flawed, and my recommendations have been ignored and dismissed, Daniel Foote said in the letter addressed to Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday. Foote was named special envoy in July, just weeks after the assassination of Haitis President plunged the country into political turmoil. Foote is enraged by the inhumane treatment of Haitian migrants. Image via FIU. In resignation letter, Daniel Foote blasts repatriation of Haitians from U.S.-Mexico border12 via Jacqueline Charles and Michael Wilner of the Miami Herald  Harshly criticizing what he called the United States inhumane treatment of Haitian migrants and its policy toward Haiti, Foote, the U.S. diplomat whose reputation for working in some of the worlds most challenging environments led the Biden administration to name him special envoy to Haiti, has resigned. In a strongly-worded resignation letter, the veteran diplomat criticized the U.S. decision to repatriate thousands of Haitians from the U.S.-Mexico border over the past few days. He also lashed out at what he called puppeteering of Haitian politics by the U.S. and other nations. Congresswoman pissed about treatment of Haitians at Texas border, says some are being sheltered in Miami13 via Amanda Batchelor of WPLG Local 10 News  Democratic U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson held a news conference with other elected officials and community activists to discuss the treatment of Haitian migrants at the Texas border. Wilson kicked off the speeches Thursday at the Little Haiti Cultural Center in Miami, calling on Biden to immediately stop deporting people to Haiti. According to the Congresswoman, some of the Haitians currently at the border have not lived in Haiti for 10 to 15 years, and the country is not equipped to take them. Wilson also addressed controversial photos that surfaced this week, showing Border Patrol agents on horses using long reins against Haitians who were crossing back into Texas after going into Mexico.  DATELINE TALLY  Senate Agriculture Committee targets racial inequality among farmers14 via Jason Delgado of Florida Politics  As head of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Sen. Darryl Rouson directed members attention Thursday to an issue he plans to address as chairman racial inequality. The plight of the Black farmer in the State of Florida is real, Rouson told members at the committees first meeting. Dania Davey, a director with the Federation of Southern Cooperatives Land Assistance Fund, briefed lawmakers Thursday about the decline of Black farmers in Florida. She warned they are losing nearly 4,000 acres each year while averaging less than half the government payments that non-Black farmers receive. Unlike their counterparts, Black farmers disproportionally are victims of discriminatory lending practices and lack adequate access to capital. Rouson will take a deep dive into the financial disparity among Floridas Black farmers. Image via Colin Hackley.

Tina Polsky, Dan Daley again push Jaimes Law to vet the sale and transfer of ammo15 via Ryan Nicol of Florida Politics  Rep. Daley is trying for the third straight Session to push forward legislation requiring background checks for ammunition purchases. The measure HB 181 is titled Jaimes Law, named after Jaime Guttenberg, one of the 17 people killed during the 2018 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland. The measure would subject those buying ammo to the same background checks that exist for individuals purchasing a gun. Ammunition could still be freely transferred at shooting ranges, or hunting and fishing sites just as before, so long as the transferor has no reason to believe that the transferee will use or intends to use the ammunition in a crime or that the transferee is prohibited from possessing ammunition under state or federal law. 8216Self-Defense Restoration Act bill proposed in Florida would require retreat before use of deadly force16 via Sam Sachs of WFLA  Rep. Michele K. Rayner filed a bill for the 2022 legislative session that would require a retreat from law enforcement officers during situations where non-deadly force is threatened or used. Rayners bill is entitled The Self-Defense Restoration Act, and is listed as HB 73. The bill would prohibit the use of deadly force by an officer who knows that it can be avoided with complete safety by retreating. It was added to the legislative agenda for 2022 on Sept. 17. Rayner is a Democrat from St. Petersburg and a civil rights attorney. The bill makes some adjustments to how officers respond to threatening situations. There are currently no co-sponsors to the bill. If enacted, HB 73 would require law enforcement officers to find alternative methods of handling situations where force is needed. Lawmakers play nice over redistricting process  for now17 via Jacob Ogles of Florida Politics  The truncated but still monthslong process of redrawing Floridas state and federal jurisdictions rolled forward Thursday. Two committees met simultaneously, further showcasing newly available tools for drawing and submitting maps. For now, the infamously partisan process remains cordial and friendly. Rep. Kelly Skidmore, the ranking Democrat on the House Congressional Redistricting Subcommittee, said she looked forward to the challenge of fair and legal districts that comply with an anti-gerrymandering amendment passed by voters just over a decade ago. Theres been plenty of skepticism over whether that will happen. Skidmore looks forward to the redistricting process, for the time being. Image via Colin Hackley. What is Floridas three strikes malpractice law? Heres how dangerous doctors evade it18 via Holly Baltz of The Palm Beach Post  In Florida, voters in 2004 passed a law that is supposed to prevent dangerous doctors from practicing medicine. Its known as the three-strikes malpractice law and requires that doctors with three findings of malpractice lose their license. Sounds pretty simple, right? But then the Florida Legislature in 2005 got involved and made it nearly impossible for the board of medicine to levy a strike. The law says a strike happens after a judgment of malpractice by the court in a lawsuit or a finding by the board of medicine or an arbitrator. If the doctor settles a malpractice case or a disciplinary complaint, which doctors often do, theres no finding of malpractice.

According to the Herald analysis, all but 131 of the newly reported deaths  about 89  occurred since Aug. 26. About 56 of the newly reported died in the past two weeks, the analysis showed. The majority of deaths happened during Floridas latest surge in COVID-19 cases, fueled by the delta variant. In all, Florida has recorded at least 3,531,465 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 53,105 deaths. In the past seven days, on average, the state has added 328 deaths and 8,227 cases to the cumulative daily total, according to Herald calculations of CDC data.

Lost to COVID-19 Summer delta wave puts Florida in Top 10 states for pandemic deaths20 via Skyler Swisher of the Orlando Sentinel  Florida has moved up as a fierce summer wave pushes the virus toll past 50,000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Florida now has the No. 10 highest per capita death rate among U.S. states. More than a fourth of those deaths have occurred over the summer, despite the widespread availability of highly effective vaccines in preventing serious illness. Behind the numbers is a trail of heartbreak. Florida purchases GlaxoSmithKline monoclonal antibody as federal reduction continues21 via Renzo Downey of Florida Politics  The DeSantis administration has purchased 3,000 doses of GlaxoSmithKlines monoclonal antibody treatment after the Biden administration reduced the federal supply of Regenerons version of the coronavirus-fighting drug by more than half. Speaking in Tampa, DeSantis told reporters the state would soon receive that shipment and could use it to offset the declining federal distributions. The news comes eight days after DeSantis met with leadership from GlaxoSmithKline, the pharmaceutical company that produces the latest monoclonal antibody therapy to receive federal approval, sotrovimab. Floridas COVID-19 surge22 via German Lopez of Vox  The most common explanation for the outbreaks in the South that we saw over the recent summer was the low vaccination rates across the region. But Florida defies the regional trend. The state ranks 20th for full vaccination in the U.S., with 56 of people fully vaccinated  not great, but a little above the national rate. According to Googles mobility data, Floridians around mid-August were about 14 less likely to travel to retail and recreational outlets than pre-pandemic times. Thats almost the same as Californians and actually lower than New Yorkers. Neither New York about 59 fully vaccinated at the time nor California about 54 fully vaccinated at the time  not much higher than Florida saw surges anywhere as bad as Floridas in August. Ron DeSantis says natural immunity is equal to vaccines. Experts say its not so simple23 via Bianca Padró Ocasio and Daniel Chang of the Miami Herald  DeSantis is focusing some of his attacks on one main claim Federal authorities are ignoring the benefits of natural immunity against COVID-19 reinfections. You cant tell noble lies to try to get people to behave in a way that you think you want them to behave in. And so, we see that time and time again in this issue of natural immunity, DeSantis said as he introduced the states new Surgeon General. Infectious disease experts and vaccine researchers agree its way too soon to make declarative statements that ignore the risk of severe illness and omit the mountain of caveats that come with a novel virus that mutates rapidly and which scientists are still struggling to understand. DeSantis says natural immunity is as good as a vaccine. Not everyone agrees. Image via Colin Hackley. U.S. begins reimbursing Florida school officials docked pay for defying mask mandate ban24 via Heidi Przybyla of NBC News  The Biden administration began compensating some Florida school board members whose pay was docked this month for defying DeSantis ban on mask mandates, the Department of Education said. As part of the Biden administrations Project SAFE grant program, an initial sum of 148,000 has been awarded to Alachua County school board members who voted this summer to mandate masks in the countys schools as Florida developed some of the worst rates of COVID-19 infection in the nation. U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said in a statement that the first wave of reimbursements offers a clear message You will not be punished for overriding GOP Governors and legislatures to make schools safer for kids.

CORONA LOCAL  Orlando VA no longer leads the nation in active COVID-19 cases, closes mobile ICU26 via Caroline Catherman of the Orlando Sentinel  The Orlando Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center closed its mobile intensive care unit on Wednesday, about three weeks after it began using it to treat patients to conserve hospital resources. The facility still limits visitors and screens them for COVID-19. The Orlando VA Healthcare System has seen a sustained decrease in COVID-19 hospitalizations over the past couple of weeks and has decommissioned the mobile ICU effective today, wrote spokesperson Heather Frebe. The VA has seen its number of active COVID-19 cases cut in half from 506 two weeks ago to 222 as of Wednesday. Patients occupy 92 of its ICU beds and 72 of its medical and surgical beds. AdventHealth Central Florida continues to report drop in COVID-19 hospitalizations as its hospitals remain at green status27 via Danielle Prieur of WMFE  There are some 660 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at AdventHealth Central Floridas hospitals in seven counties. That represents an almost 50 drop in hospitalizations from the peak in August when about 1,700 people were in its hospital and ICU beds. Chief Clinical Officer Dr. Neil Finkler says, This slow, but steady decline in new admissions of COVID-19 patients is a positive signal that we continue to head in the right direction. Finkler urges residents to continue to get vaccinated in order to avoid severe cases of the coronavirus that might result in hospitalization and death. Although hospitalizations are dropping, hospital capacity remains high which is why AdventHealth is still operating under green status. the COVID-19 pressure starting to release in Central Florida?

Dramatic drop in COVID-19 hospitalizations across South Florida28 via Peter DOench of CBS4 Brevard quarantine critics hail rule allowing asymptomatic exposed students to go to class29 via Bailey Gallion of Florida Today  Previously, students exposed to COVID-19 were required to quarantine at least four days and could return on the fifth day with a negative COVID-19 test if they did not have symptoms. Parents can now choose to send exposed children to school as long as they remain asymptomatic, or they can quarantine an asymptomatic child for up to seven days. The move runs counter to guidance from the CDC and has been criticized by liberal politicians, some school officials and the states largest teachers union over fears that it may drive further spread of COVID-19. Some people infected with COVID-19 may never show symptoms, and both they and infected people who are not yet symptomatic can spread the virus.  2022  Charlie Crist wants newly minted Surgeon General fired over new COVID-19 rules30 via Anne Geggis of Florida Politics  Its only Dr. Joseph Ladapos second day as Floridas Surgeon General and Crist already wants him removed for what he calls a reckless order that leaves it up to parents whether their COVID-19-exposed child should stay home from school. Crist hosted an online event Thursday with school officials, parents, and a teacher to decry the action, which he says is going to remove a layer of protection for the most vulnerable children, many of them who are too young to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Hiring an anti-mask, vaccine skeptic to be the states top doctor is another way for DeSantis to go soft on COVID, Crist said. Crist wants Joseph Ladapo gone. Image via Colin Hackley. Floridas property insurance markets ripe for 2022 battle  Floridas property insurance market is in dire shape and will likely be a major issue in the 2022 midterms. It is dire. These are not good results, Florida Insurance Commissioner David Altmaier told a Senate committee this week. These results continue to not be sustainable. We will see companies either not survive or decide Florida is not the place for them to conduct business. Matt Dixon of POLITICO reports that property insurance reform is shaping up to be a major battle in The Capitol. By 2022, the effects of a huge insurance bill designed to limit costs for insurance companies will be better known, particularly in Crists gubernatorial campaign. In 2006, when Crist won the race as a Republican, Florida had just experienced a series of hurricanes, with a spike in property insurance rates.

I have always identified politically as a Hispanic, Rosen Gonzalez, who is hoping voters will return her to the Miami Beach Commission this November, told the Miami Herald Editorial Board during a scheduled interview Thursday. Ive apologized, and Ive said I am obviously not Hispanic.

CORONA NATION  U.S. sets the stage for COVID-19 booster shots for millions32 via Lauran Neergaard and Mike Stobbe of The Associated Press  The U.S. vaccination drive against COVID-19 stood on the verge of a major new phase as government advisers Thursday recommended booster doses of Pfizers vaccine for millions of older or otherwise vulnerable Americans  despite doubts the extra shots will do much to slow the pandemic. Advisers to the CDC said boosters should be offered to people 65 and older, nursing home residents, and those ages 50 to 64 who have risky underlying health problems. The extra dose would be given once they are at least six months past their last Pfizer shot. Still, getting the unvaccinated first shots remains the top priority, and the panel wrestled with whether the booster debate was distracting from that goal. shots are coming for millions of Americans.

What future COVID-19 spread could look like33 via Akshay Syal of NBC News  New COVID-19 cases reached a high point Sept. 13, with a seven-day average of cases at 166,807, NBC News data finds. Since then, cases have been gradually dropping nationwide for seven of the last eight days. Its the most consistent decline since June 23, a period before the delta variant took hold in the U.S. Ali Mokdad, chief strategy officer at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, is hopeful that cases should continue to decline. It will not be a sharp decline like we saw a sharp rise, Mokdad warned. He said there could be a bump around the December holidays due to the seasonality of the virus, potential relaxation of physical distancing measures, and any waning immunity from the vaccines. Rural vaccinations climb by fastest rate in three months34 via Tim Marema of the Daily Yonder  New vaccinations in rural America last week reached their highest level in three months, according to a Daily Yonder analysis. The increase in newly completed vaccinations came as the rural death rate from COVID-19 climbed to twice that of metropolitan areas. Rural counties reported approximately 362,000 newly completed vaccinations last week. Thats an increase of about 20 over two weeks ago and the largest number of new vaccinations recorded in rural counties since the third week of June. In metropolitan counties, the number of newly completed vaccinations climbed by about 9 compared to two weeks ago.

They argue the new law violates federal requirements for safe workplaces and reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities and want a federal judge to rule that it doesnt apply to hospitals and other medical providers. The Montana Medical Association, private physician groups, a Missoula hospital and seven individuals filed the complaint in U.S. District Court in Missoula on Wednesday, arguing the law inhibits providers ability to practice ethical and effective medicine by requiring them to employ unvaccinated workers who are more likely to spread infections and diseases than vaccinated workers. Penn State temporarily suspends 117 students for missing required coronavirus testing38 via Paulina Firozi of The Washington Post  More than 100 students at Penn State have been temporarily suspended for failing to comply with the schools weekly coronavirus testing requirement, the university said this week. Students and employees who are not vaccinated against the coronavirus must undergo weekly testing throughout the semester, which the school said it announced before the start of the fall semester. Students who did not disclose that they are fully vaccinated received weekly emails about the required testing. There are 117 students who have missed at least three weeks of testing and have been placed on interim suspension, the school said. Last week, staff called students with three missed tests, an effort that brought several hundred students into compliance, according to a statement.

U.S. and European economies slowed by delta variant, supply chain bottlenecks40 via Jason Douglas and Amara Omeokwe of The Wall Street Journal  Manufacturing and services businesses in both the U.S. and Eurozone reported slower growth in activity this month, although the pullback was more pronounced in Europe. Forecasting firm IHS Markit said its index measuring U.S. business activity, based on surveys on purchasing managers, fell to 54.5 in September from 55.4 in August. That was the lowest level in a year. A level above 50 points to an increase in activity, while a level below 50 indicates a contraction. IHS Markit said its index of eurozone activity fell to a five-month low of 56.1 in September from 59 in August. The fall was steeper than predicted. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had expected a reading of 58.5. A record number of cargo ships off the California coast shows a crack in the supply chain.41 via Gregory Schmidt of The New York Times  Sixty-one vessels were anchored offshore on Thursday waiting to unload cargo, down from a record 73 on Sunday, said Capt. J. Kipling Louttit, the executive director of the Marine Exchange of Southern California, a nonprofit that works in partnership with the Coast Guard to provide data on maritime commerce. In addition to the anchored ships, 29 were adrift up to 20 miles offshore. The delay in getting the container ships to port comes as the easing of pandemic restrictions and increased consumer spending have ramped up demand. As a result, manufacturers are struggling to keep pace, and shortages of some products, like semiconductors, have caused slowdowns in production. COVID-19 requirements add another number to define small businesses.42 via Stacy Cowley of The New York Times  When the Biden administration announced a mandate that employees be vaccinated or tested regularly at companies with 100 or more employees, business leaders responded with a barrage of questions. Among smaller companies, one loomed especially large Why 100? Its an appealingly round, easy-to-remember number, and it captures a broad section of the American workforce. But as a dividing line between a big business and a small one, its a threshold not found in any other major federal or state law. For entrepreneurs who employ a smattering of workers, thats an increasingly common challenge Every time lawmakers invent a new regulation, they also make up a new definition of which businesses count as small.

Vaccinations would soon be available even for infants, he said. Asked if that meant a return to normal in the second half of next year, he said As of today, in a year, I assume. Bancel said he expected governments to approve booster shots for people already vaccinated because patients at risk who were vaccinated last autumn undoubtedly needed a refresher. Its booster shot had half the initial dose, which meant more of them would be available. more vaccines, Stphane Bancel thinks the coronavirus pandemic could be over within a year. COVID-19 treatment derived from antibodies found in llamas shows promise in initial study45 via Annabelle Timsit of The Washington Post  A small antibody found in llamas and camels that has been studied as the basis for a potential treatment for COVID-19 showed promise in new research published Wednesday in the scientific journal Nature Communications. In the study, researchers injected a llama called Fifi with noninfectious parts of the coronavirus, which triggered an immune response. They then harvested Fifis blood and isolated nanobodies  small antibodies found in some animals that are prized by researchers because of their ability to get into nooks and crannies and because they are slow to degrade in the body  that they manipulated in a lab to increase their ability to bind to the virus. According to the researchers, the nanobodies were able to neutralize the coronavirus and its alpha and beta variants in lab experiments.

The twist was that Wilmore Funeral Home was a fictional business, and its website sent visitors to a vaccine registration page. The phone number belonged to Crenshaw Visions, the advertising agency that owned the truck. real eye-opening message from a fake mortuary. Image via Twitter. Both vaccinated?

Answers to your vaccine questions I got two shots in Argentina. Am I considered fully vaccinated in the U.S.?49 via Lois K. Solomon of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel  The Biden administration is easing travel restrictions into the United States beginning Nov. 1. Tourists coming in from other countries will need to show proof of vaccination and a negative test for COVID-19 taken within three days of boarding the plane. To be considered fully inoculated, foreign travelers must have two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine or one dose of the Johnson amp38 Johnson vaccine. The U.S. will also accept vaccines approved for emergency use by the World Health Organization, including the AstraZeneca shot. However, Russias Sputnik V vaccine has not been approved by the WHO. So, you will not be considered fully vaccinated in the U.S., and its the same for Canada.  PRESIDENTIAL  Joe Biden pushes deterrent border policy after promising humane approach50 via Michael D. Shear, Natalie Kitroeff, Zolan Kanno-Youngs and Eileen Sullivan of The New York Times  The images could have come straight from Trumps immigration playbook mounted Border Patrol agents rounding up desperate Haitian families at the southwestern border for rapid deportation from the United States. In fact, the aggressive effort to quickly clear a makeshift camp in Del Rio, Texas, of more than 15,000 Haitian migrants was part of a Biden administration response that included surging agents to the overrun area using a public health immigration rule invoked by Trump to send many people home. President Bidens spokeswoman said the scenes of agents on horseback were horrific and not acceptable or appropriate. Biden seeks a more humane approach to Haitian migrants. Biden administration directs border officials to suspend horse patrols in Del Rio migrant camp51 via Nick Miroff of The Washington Post  The Biden administration has directed U.S. border officials to suspend patrols by agents on horseback in the Del Rio, Texas, migrant camp, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Thursday. Psaki said Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told civil rights leaders Thursday the department would no longer use horses in Del Rio. So that is something, a policy change that has been made in response, she said, describing the administrations reaction to anger from Democratic lawmakers, rights groups and others over widely circulated images showing U.S. agents on horseback charging at migrants, including families, in an attempt to drive them back to Mexico, while cursing and swinging reins in the air. White House weighs invoking defense law to get chip data52 via Jenny Leonard of Bloomberg  The Biden administration is considering invoking a Cold War-era national security law to force companies in the semiconductor supply chain to provide information on inventory and sales of chips, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said Thursday. The goal is to alleviate bottlenecks that have idled U.S. car production and caused consumer electronics shortages and identify possible hoarding, she said in an interview. Her team for months has sought clarity into how companies allocate their semiconductor supply. The Commerce Department is now asking companies to fill out questionnaires within 45 days providing supply chain information. The request is voluntary, but Raimondo said she warned industry representatives that she might invoke the Defense Production Act or other tools to force their hands if they dont respond. Biden finalizes move to phase out potent greenhouse gas used in refrigeration53 via Maureen Groppe of USA Today  The Environmental Protection Agency has finalized the first major step taken under Biden to curb climate change, releasing new regulations to phase down the use of hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, a potent greenhouse gas used in refrigeration. Emissions would be cut by 85 over 15 years. By 2050, the reductions would be the equivalent of eliminating three years worth of carbon dioxide emissions from Americas power sector, according to the administration. Critics have charged that the restrictions will hurt consumers whose air conditioners and refrigerators run on affordable refrigerant. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute joined with other business groups in praising the regulation as balanced and a win-win for both the climate and the economy. Americas54 billionaires pay an average income tax rate of just 8.2, Biden administration says55 via Sarah Ewall-Wice of CBS News  The Biden administration analysis estimated billionaires paid 8.2 of their income between 2010 and 2018, including on forms of income that go largely untaxed  lower than the rates paid by most Americans. In that final year of analysis, it notes that those families had at least 2.1 billion in wealth, according to Forbes. The analysis by economists from the Office of Management and Budget and the White House Council of Economic Advisers drew from publicly available data and said the disparity is primarily driven by how the tax code treats income generated from wealth  such as income from stocks, whose worth increases over time  rather than wages, which are immediately taxed. South Florida developer nominated to be Bidens ambassador to Belgium56 via Bianca Padró Ocasio of the Miami Herald  Biden nominated Coral Gables real estate mogul Michael Adler as the new U.S. ambassador to Belgium, one of two ambassadorship nominations of major Democratic fundraisers announced Wednesday. Adler, the chairman and CEO of South Florida-based Adler Group, Inc., has been a Democratic donor for over a decade and was the national finance chairman of Bidens 2008 presidential campaign. In 2019, ahead of the Democratic presidential preference primary, Adler hosted a private fundraiser for Biden at the Gables Club, where then-candidate Biden warned the crowd of about 200 people that reelecting Trump would be the end of NATO. gets an ambassadorship.

EPILOGUE TRUMP  Biden White House leans toward releasing information about Donald Trump and Jan. 6 attack, setting off legal and political showdown57 via Tom Hamburger and Jacqueline Alemany of The Washington Post  The White House is leaning toward releasing information to Congress about what Trump and his aides were doing during the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol despite the former Presidents objections, a decision that could have significant political and legal ramifications. Trump has said he will cite executive privilege to block information requests from the House select committee investigating the events of that day, banking on a legal theory that has successfully allowed Presidents and their aides to avoid or delay congressional scrutiny for decades, including during the Trump administration. But President Bidens White House plans to err on the side of disclosure given the gravity of the events of Jan. 6. Trump is not happy with the White House releasing info about his association with Jan. 6. Image via Bloomberg. 8216He put himself ahead of the country Chris Christie rips Trumps election claims58 via David M. Drucker of Yahoo News  Christie said Trump should stop peddling conspiracy theories that the 2020 election was stolen, arguing that the claims are inconsistent with putting America first and damage the Republican Partys efforts to blunt Bidens agenda. I think it would be better if he accepted the results of the 2020 election. And I think that would be better for the country. There hasnt been any type of substantive evidence that has come forward, the former two-term New Jersey Governor and Republican 2024 contender said during a virtual appearance at the annual Texas Tribune Festival. Trump moving political HQ back to Mar-a-Lago59 via Paul Steinhauser of Fox News  Trump has headed south to Florida. A top adviser to the former President says that with the onset of autumn, Trumps moved his residence and political operation back to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach. The season is starting to open down there, Corey Lewandowski said. You are going to see a complete rush of candidates going down to the Mar-a-Lago area to do fundraising, to be near the President, to talk to him, to get his advice and counsel. Trump moved from the White House to Mar-a-Lago in late January, at the end of his presidency. But in May, he moved his political headquarters and residence north to his Bedminster golf club in New Jersey. Michael Flynn thinks they might be putting the COVID-19 vaccine in your salad dressing60 via Ryan Bort of Rolling Stone  On Monday, Flynn appeared on Thrivetime Show Business School Without the B.S., a podcast clearly meant to drive business to host Clay Clarks business coaching program. Its hard to overstate how far afield of reality, or even mainstream conspiracy-theory culture, the discussion ventures. At one point, Flynn suggests that the government could be secretly administering the vaccine through salad dressing. The idea that they are putting vaccines in salad dressing likely trickled down from a recent story about how researchers at the University of California at Irvine are trying to develop a way to grow edible plants that contain the same medication active in the mRNA vaccines.  CRISIS  Jan. 6 investigation accelerates as it turns toward Trump61 via Kyle Cheney and Nicholas Wu of POLITICO  The march to unearth Trumps Jan. 6 secrets has shifted into a sprint. In interviews, six members of the House panel investigating the Capitol attack made clear that theyre prepared to fly past any obstacles they encounter, mindful of Trumps past success at stymieing congressional investigators. The calendar makes their job tougher Panel members know they need to show results quickly as the midterms bear down, given Democrats thin majority. The schedule has always been a challenge to accomplish what we need to accomplish in the time frame, said Democratic Rep. Pete Aguilar of California.

Jan. 6 select committee subpoenas four Trump aides62 via Ivana Saric of Axios  The Jan 6. select committee investigating the deadly Capitol riot has subpoenaed four aides to Trump for testimony and documents. Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, former communications official Dan Scavino, former Defense Department official Kash Patel, and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon were all in touch with the White House on or in the days leading up to the Jan. 6 insurrection, the committee said in a release. These are the first subpoenas for testimony issued by the select committee. Earlier Thursday committee member Rep. Adam Schiff warned that those who refuse to comply with subpoenas would be guilty of criminal contempt. To sue The New York Times and his niece, Donald Trump turned to a low-profile attorney from New Jersey63 via David A. Farenthold and Alice Crites of The Washington Post  Earlier this month, one of Trumps best-known attorneys, veteran litigator Marc E. Kasowitz, withdrew from a case where Trump had been sued for defamation. Trump replaced him with a lower profile lawyer Alina Habba, from a four-attorney firm with offices near Trumps Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club. Her experience included serving as general counsel for a parking garage company. On Tuesday, she filed a 100 million lawsuit on Trumps behalf, targeting The New York Times, three Times reporters, and his niece Mary L. Trump. Trump alleges that Trump violated the terms of a 2001 legal settlement by providing the reporters with family financial records, which they used to write Pulitzer Prize-winning stories.  D.C. MATTERS  Democrats see tax framework to pay for huge 3.5T package64 via Lisa Mascaro and Alan Fram of The Associated Press  Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced the progress as Biden administration officials and Democratic congressional leaders negotiated behind the scenes. Staring down a self-imposed Monday deadline, lawmakers said they would work nonstop to find agreement on specifics. Democrats views on those vary widely, though they largely agree with Bidens idea of raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy to fund the package. Moderate Democrats, most prominently Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, are demanding that the massive dollar total be reduced. The revenue options to pay for it  that mostly means taxes  being considered can be dialed up or down, the leaders say. The ultimate price tag may certainly slip from the much-publicized 3.5 trillion. Schumer says Democrats are headed in the right direction on Joe Bidens massive infrastructure bill. Image via AP. Nancy Pelosi says government funding wont lapse65 via Kristina Peterson and Andrew Restuccia of The Wall Street Journal  House Speaker Pelosi said Congress wouldnt let government funding expire next week, on the same day that the Biden administration began preparing for a possible partial shutdown. We will keep our government open by Sept. 30, which is our date, and continue the conversation about the debt ceiling, but not for long, she said Thursday. We will have a continuing resolution that passes both houses by Sept. 30. White House officials remained optimistic that lawmakers would avoid a shutdown. There is enough time for Congress to prevent a lapse in appropriations, and we are confident they will do so, White House Office of Management and Budget spokesman Abdullah Hasan said. House Democrats plan Saturday votes to advance tax, spend plan66 via Erik Wasson and John Fitzpatrick of Bloomberg  House Democrats are attempting to move forward with the next procedural step needed to pass Bidens economic agenda, penciling in a rare Saturday committee meeting to advance a proposed 3.5 trillion package. The Budget Committees markup could occur Friday instead of Saturday if Republicans agree to an expedited schedule, Chairman John Yarmuth said, adding that he expects the full House to consider the package next week. The committees vote on the individual components of the tax and spending bill is a necessary step but does not mean Democrats have resolved all their differences on the package. The Budget panel cannot amend what the other committees voted to approve earlier this month  any changes would come in the Rules Committee or on the House floor. Federal court voids ruling on minimum age requirements for purchasing handguns67 via CBS News  A federal appeals court tossed out an earlier ruling that found federal laws prohibiting the sale of handguns to young adults under the age of 21 are unconstitutional, because the woman who mounted the legal battle against the minimum age requirement turned 21 Despite efforts to add parties and reframe her claimed injuries, it is too late to revive this case. So, it must be dismissed as moot, Judge Julius Richardson wrote in an opinion. The 4th Circuit panel ruled in the dispute over the age requirements for handgun purchases in July, finding that 18-year-olds possess the constitutional right to keep and bear arms. The ruling from the 4th Circuit panel was at the time criticized by gun control groups. The tangled tale of the Israel consulate, the Dilbert cartoonist and the Matt Gaetz case68 via Marc Caputo of POLITICO  Scant media attention has been paid in the sex crimes investigation to the mysterious cameo of Jake Novak, broadcast media director of the Consulate General of Israel in New York. Three days before the story broke in March that federal investigators were probing whether Gaetz had sex with a 17-year-old girl, Novak began corresponding with Dilbert cartoonist Scott Adams about the scandal. Novak indicated to Adams he had inside knowledge of the probe and suggested he was personally involved to get 25 million out of Gaetzs wealthy father to help free an American hostage in Iran named Bob Levinson.

Latest poll for St. Pete Mayors race shows Ken Welch with wide lead over Robert Blackmon70 via Janelle Irwin Taylor of Florida Politics  The poll, the first since the Aug. 24 Primary, shows Welch with 53 support to Blackmons 36, with 11 of voters still unsure in the race. Thats a troubling data point for Blackmon because it shows even if undecided voters broke his way, it still wouldnt be enough to bridge the gap with Welch. The lead is well outside the St. Pete Polls surveys 4.5 margin of error. The last poll taken just days before the Primary showed Welch leading Blackmon in a hypothetical General Election matchup with the same 53 share of the vote. Blackmon improved some from that poll, which showed him at the time with just 29 support. polling has Robert Blackmon slipping further behind Ken Welch. Everyone is talking about DeSantis  except in St. Petes Mayor race71 via Steve Contorno of the Tampa Bay Times  Hes a topic of conversation in races from California to Virginia and in the White House briefing room. Hes a hashtag and on flags. It seems everyone these days is talking about DeSantis  except the candidates running for mayor in St. Petersburg. Welch and Blackmon have all but ignored the states consequential and contentious Governor on the campaign trail. DeSantis hardly came up during the summer primary, and he remains a distant presence in the weeks since the race for City Hall became a two-man runoff. 6 women, babies dead. Botched circumcisions. Catastrophic injuries. Why this baby doctor practiced for decades72 via John Pacenti and Holly Baltz of the Palm Beach Post  The birthing suite at Good Samaritan Medical Center resembled something out of a movie, like a murder scene, Jorge Douglas Miranda Romero recalls. Moments earlier, hed watched his wife, Onystei Castillo-Lopez, give birth to their second child, a healthy baby boy. But something wasnt right. After holding her son for about five minutes, Castillo-Lopez said she wasnt feeling well. And then the blood wouldnt stop. Castillo-Lopez was barely conscious when her husband spoke to her for the last time, as she was taken to surgery to stop the bleeding. Neither the husband, who is known as Miranda, nor his wife were aware that Dr. Berto Lopez had his medical license restricted by Florida three months earlier. 750,000 in cash recovered amid rubble of Surfside condo collapse. Victims will get it back.73 via Jay Weaver of the Miami Herald  When the Surfside condo tumbled down in June, rescue workers painstakingly searched through the mountain of debris to recover nearly 100 victims and lots of personal property. Among the buried personal items at the collapse site of the 12-story Champlain Towers South condo building were cars in the underground garage, as well as furniture, clothes, jewelry and photos of families and friends. Miami-Dade County rescue workers also recovered cash  about 750,000 in total  some still neatly tucked into purses and wallets but most randomly scattered throughout the sprawling rubble. Surfside families call for memorial at site of condo collapse74 via David Selig and Alex Finnie of WPLG Local 10 News  Repeating that we do not build over dead bodies, family members of Surfside condo collapse victims demanded Thursday that a memorial be placed at the site where the Champlain Towers South once stood  not new construction. Thursdays news conference took place on the beachwalk along Collins Avenue, between 87th and 88th Streets. Since the June 24 tragedy, a debate has ensued over what to do with the 1.88-acre plot of land where 98 lives were lost. Some say it should be sold for the highest price to support the surviving residents and families of the victims. Others wish to see a memorial on that very land, which they say is sacred. Three Miami Beach police officers involved in rough arrest now face felony charges75 via David Ovalle of the Miami Herald  Three Miami Beach police officers charged over the rough arrest of two men at the Royal Palm South Beach hotel two months ago will have their charges upgraded to felonies. Prosecutors announced upgraded charges for Officer Kevin Perez and Sgt. Jose Perez, who had been charged with misdemeanor battery and are now charged with third-degree felony battery. Officer Steven Serrano is now charged with a count of official misconduct, a third-degree felony, for allegedly authoring a bogus police report about the incident. Serrano is still facing a misdemeanor battery charge. Prosecutors said officers on July 26 used excessive force against a man named Dalonta Crudup, who had been illegally parked on a motor scooter on 13 Street and Ocean Court. Latest Florida election glitch In Miami cop union poll, hundreds of votes cast from Kansas76 via Charles Rabin of the Miami Herald  Despite the controversies surrounding him and a lashing from Miami commissioners, someone appears to be a very big fan of Miami Police Chief Art Acevedo. So much so that a person using the same computer address somewhere in Kansas likely voted for the chief more than 500 times in a police union poll that could help to determine his fate in the city. The discrepancy threatens to further muddle and delay the results of an already quite unscientific poll commissioned by the president of the citys Fraternal Order of Police  an elected officer who has been anything but shy over a series of beefs hes had over the chiefs actions in the past few months. Miami may ban homeless encampments, arrest residents. Advocates say thats the crime77 via Anna Jean Kaiser and Joey Flechas of the Miami Herald  Bambi Nicole Kuttkuhn was afraid when police came through the I-95 overpass on NW 11th last month, an area where she and some 60 homeless people resided. She said they took some of her belongings, saying theyd been stolen, and forced her and the others to leave. After three weeks living in a vacant lot about a mile away, the 43-year-old is back, but worried about a proposed city ordinance that would give the police new powers and could make such clearings more frequent. City commissioners last week gave initial approval to an ordinance that prohibits encampments on public property and in entryways. Why SunPass payments may be on their way out at Miami International Airport garages78 via Douglas Hanks of the Miami Herald  Miami International Airport plans to stop accepting SunPass payments by the end of the year, cutting off the only remote pay option in the parking garages at one of Floridas busiest airports. A recent memo lays out MIAs strategy to drop SunPass at MIAs Dolphin and Flamingo garages. The latest agreement with a parking operator that won a 2019 bidding contest to upgrade MIAs garage technology deletes the SunPass component and installs a Pay-on-Foot system, which is a user-friendly alternative, Jimmy Morales, Miami-Dade Countys chief operating officer, wrote in a memo presented at the Sept. 13 meeting of the county commissions Airport and Economic Development committee. Condo prices dip in Miami for first time this year. Heres how much they went down79 via Rebecca San Juan of the Miami Herald  Home prices decreased slightly in Miami-Dade County in August, according to the latest Miami Association of Realtors sales report on Wednesday. The median sales price dipped by about 3 for single-family homes  from 515,000 to 500,500  and by almost 2 for condos  from 340,000 to 335,000 in Miami-Dade. It is the first drop in condo prices in 2021 in the county. From January through June, condo prices increased from 280,000 to 340,000 and remained steady for July. Single-family homes last declined in price from April to May. In Broward County, prices remained steady for houses and increased slightly for condos. Stronger sense of community would increase Broward philanthropy80 via Sylvia Gurinsky in the South Florida Sun-Sentinel  In July, the Community Foundation of Broward, the countys fundraising arm, issued a report titled Untapped Potential Growing Philanthropy in Broward. The report indicates that county residents give over 1 billion a year in local charitable contributions, and the total is going up. However, Broward lags behind Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties, as well as nationwide communities of comparable size, in total contributions. The biggest donations are concentrated in a handful of neighborhoods, mainly in Fort Lauderdale. From 2016 to 2018, about 70 of donations from Broward-headquartered private foundations went outside the county. The study indicates that 85 of Broward residents have been in the same home for at least a year. But a longer look is needed. His books on Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King, Jr. were banned.

Orange teachers push for bigger raises as school board laments state budget cuts82 via Leslie Postal of the Orlando Sentinel  The Orange County teachers union was shocked and saddened when the county school district offered 175 raises to most teachers this year. Convinced Orange County Public Schools could afford far more, union leaders pressed for a better package last week at both the Orange County School Board meetings and during an impasse hearing before a special magistrate. Dennis Campagna, the special magistrate who heard the case, likely will not make a recommendation on how to resolve the pay dispute until the end of October, at the earliest, and whatever he decides will not be binding. Under Florida law, school boards have the final say. They also start the process by setting a tentative budget and the parameters for salary negotiations. Clock is ticking for glitch-free Citrus County EMS takeover83 via Mike Wright of Florida Politics  At a special meeting Wednesday, Citrus Commissioners voted unanimously to keep in place an emergency declaration that board Chairman Scott Carnahan signed on Friday. The declaration provides authority for County Administrator Randy Oliver to spend money without prior board approval, negotiate contracts and bypass the bid process in the circumstances related to the Oct. 2 takeover of Nature Coast EMS. In a Friday email, County Attorney Denise Dymond Lyn said the emergency is necessary to ensure the transition takes place on time with no glitches. Oliver said all but four of NCEMSs 72 paramedics and emergency medical technicians applied for jobs with the county heading into the transition. The jobs are very much in demand, he said.  TOP OPINION  The unTrump presidency slams into Trumpness84 via Frank Bruni of The New York Times  Frances foreign minister described himself as angry and bitter. He called what Biden had done brutal. But those harsh adjectives meant nothing next to something else that the diplomat, Jean-Yves Le Drian, uttered late last week. He said that Bidens decision to negotiate a secret submarine deal with Australia that nullified a lucrative French arrangement reminded him a lot of what Trump used to do. And nothing about Biden is ever supposed to remind anyone of Trump. All in all, Biden is a far cry from Trump. But that doesnt mean that hes untouched by Trump. And it doesnt mean that he wont find himself in similar places, because hes navigating some of the same dynamics.  OPINIONS  Gwen Ifill was right about missing white woman syndrome85 via Charles M. Blow of The New York Times  The breathless coverage of the disappearance and apparent killing of Gabrielle Petito has played out in a virtual and sometimes literal split-screen alongside images of mounted officers in Texas swinging long reins like whips while herding Haitian migrants. It is not that these white women should matter less, but rather that all missing people should matter equally. Race should not determine how newsroom leaders assign coverage, especially because those decisions often lead to disproportionate allocation of government resources, as investigators try to solve the highest-profile cases.

One to charge them all E.U. demands single plug for phones94 via Kelvin Chan of The Associated Press  The European Union announced plans Thursday to require the smartphone industry to adopt a uniform charging cord for mobile devices, a push that could eliminate the all-too-familiar experience of rummaging through a drawer full of tangled cables to find the right one. The European Commission proposed legislation that would mandate USB-C cables for charging, a technology that many device makers have already adopted. The main holdout is Apple, which said it was concerned the new rules would limit innovation, ending up hurting consumers. The draft rules also call for standardizing fast charging technology and giving consumers the right to choose whether to buy new devices with or without a charger, which the EU estimates will save consumers 250 million euros 293 million a year.

The funds, approved earlier this month by the Executive Council and the Joint Legislative Fiscal Committee, will provide one-time grants to support shelter providers, including short-term cold weather shelters, to address pandemic-related increased costs and anticipated demand as the winter months approach. In a request for the funds, Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Shibinette wrote that the state contracts with 19 shelter providers for 791 emergency shelter beds, but the health department does not fund temporary cold weather shelters. She wrote that preliminary data for the 2022 Point-in-Time count for New Hampshire shows 1,605 people experiencing homelessness, an increase of 7.6 from 2021. The federal funds will provide 4million in grants to the existing shelters under contract with the department and 1million to each county, municipality, nonprofit or coalition to assist with cold weather shelters.","homeless, homelessness"
portland,"Protecting coasts, book bike, Chicago Marathon: News from around our 50 states",2022-10-11T00:00:00Z,USA Today Online,The Oregonian,"New York The mayor declared a state of emergency Friday over the thousands of migrants being sent from Southern states since the spring, saying the demand being put on the city to provide housing and other assistance is not sustainable. A city recovering from an ongoing global pandemic is being overwhelmed by a humanitarian crisis made by human hands, Mayor Eric Adams said. We are at the edge of the precipice.  We need help. And we need it now. By the end of its fiscal year, Adams said the city expected to spend 1 billion helping the new arrivals, many of whom are heavily reliant on government aid because federal law prohibits them from working in the U.S. Adams, a Democrat, said the new arrivals are welcome in the city. And he spoke with pride of New York Citys history as a landing spot for new immigrants. New Yorkers have always looked out for our immigrant brothers and sisters. We see ourselves in them. We see our ancestors in them, he said. But though our compassion is limitless, our resources are not, he said. New York Citys already strained shelter system has been under even greater pressure. Between five and six buses of migrants are arriving per day, Adams said, with nine on Thursday alone. And 1 in 5 beds in New York Citys homeless shelter system is now occupied by a migrant, swelling its population to record levels. The city has opened 42 new, temporary shelters, mostly in hotels, but Adams said more would need to be done.",homeless

The blockchain technology company thanked the crypto community for outpouring support. LBRY is a network based on blockchain technology that enables creators to publish digital content, with consumers having the option of supporting creators using LBRY Credits. The content can include audio, video, documents, and other types of files. The network hosts more than 20 million users globally. Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC launched a complaint over LBRY Credits. The SEC wants LBRY Credits, which are used by millions of people, to be classified as securities. The move would affect many crypto assets, making it illegal to transact or exchange them. The Securities and Exchange Commission is attempting to make virtually ALL cryptocurrencies in the United States illegal to freely transact and exchange, the petition states. The petition also points out that big banks crashed the economy in 2008 with almost no punishment and big tech exploits and abuses us freely. Yet the SEC goes after blockchain and cryptocurrency, which is one of the best hopes the people have to take back control.78 IMF Brexit Britain to Outgrow Eurozone and Bidens America by 202279 The International Monetary Fund IMF has predicted that Brexit Britain will grow faster than the Eurozone as well as the United States by next year, despite having one of the steepest contractions of any major Western nation during the Chinese coronavirus crisis.

Constitutional carry ensures a barrier-free commitment to Second Amendment rights and is core to a strong public safety agenda, said Gov. Lee.

Announcing his lawsuit against the federal government and the CDC, DeSantis said, The federal government and the CDC has locked down this industry for over a year. This is not reasonable, this is not rational, and guess what? If they say that cruising is not safe, even with widespread vaccine availability, all the testing you want, they have now antibody treatments that have been very effective, they have all these different things, its a much different situation than a year ago. He added, Guess what? People are still going to go on cruises.92 CAIR Joins the Censorship Campaign Against Upcoming Game Six Days in Fallujah93 Now that advocacy groups and journalists know that they can cause enough of a scene to pressure tech companies to comply with their censorship demands, theyre taking every opportunity possible to wield their power  most often in bad faith.

Greg Abbott is an outspoken critic of Facebook for its censorship.

Last month, while unveiling a new state legislation that would make it illegal for social media companies to censor content based on viewpoint, the governor singled out Facebook, saying its actions were un-American and un-Texan.128 The Biden Administration and Washingtons Continuing Rift With the European Allies129 by Ted Galen Carpenter President Joe Biden and his advisers repeatedly emphasize that a top priority of the new administration is to restore Americas international leadership and repair the transatlantic relationship that former-President Donald Trump weakened with his emphasis on an America First foreign policy. However, three noticeable areas of disagreement are already creating obstacles to a rapprochement between the United States and its European partners the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline, policy toward Iran, and policy toward China. The Biden administration inherited an already contentious situation regarding Nord Stream 2. U.S. leaders exhibited unrelenting hostility to the pipeline from the moment construction began in 2011. The Obama and Trump administrations argued that the pipeline, running under the Baltic Sea to link Russia and Germany, would deepen the dependence of Germany and other democratic European nations on Russian energy supplies. That enhanced dependence, U.S. officials argued, would give Moscow geopolitical leverage to a dangerous extent over its western neighbors. Despite strenuous European objections, the U.S. Congress in 2019 and 2020 even authorized the imposition of sanctions in an effort to halt construction. Rather than backing away from such a confrontational policy, Biden and his foreign policy team seem determined to escalate matters. On March 18, Secretary of State Antony Blinken issued a statement demanding that firms involved in the pipeline project immediately cease work. As multiple U.S. administrations have made clear, Blinken stated, this pipeline is a Russian geopolitical project intended to divide Europe and weaken European energy security. The following week, he explicitly warned German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas that sanctions against his countrys firms were a real possibility if construction of the nearly complete pipeline continued. 130 The Divergence Between the Two Americas is Growing Wider.131 Remember Joe Bidens promise that if we just followed the voodoo for a few more months, we might be able to gather in small groups by July 4?

In a recent podcast, Beverley McLachlin, who served as Canadas 17th Chief Justice, from 2000 to 2017, said that the government should have a takedown mechanism. We also need other mechanisms, she added. We need a place where people can raise complaints. However, McLachlin did not go into specifics as to what she considers harmful language. She also did not give examples of what websites use harmful language.

I149 The pandemic has exposed underlying, inhumane, Eugenics-driven public health policies. The shocking evidence is that those public health policies were implemented in the most developed, economically wealthy countries. Those with the highest standard of living denied medical treatment for elderly nursing home residents, essentially condemning them to death. Half of all European COVID-19-related deaths have occurred among residents in nursing homes A report by the London School of Economics found that in Italy, France, Ireland, Spain and Belgium between 42 percent and 57 percent of deaths from the virus have taken place in nursing homes. In Italy, people call it the silent massacre. In the UK, more than 20,000 residents of care homes died from Covid-19 during the first wave of the pandemic. The decision to discharge thousands of hospital patients into care homes in the spring, in order to free up hospital beds and protect the National Health Service, was likely to blame. Some MPs accused the Government of throwing care homes to the wolves. Comment Notice how western countries co-ordinated the dumping of covid patients in nursing homes.

Such documentation may be held on a mobile phone app, recording natural immunity after recovering from the Chinese virus, vaccination, or a recent negative lateral flow test. Comment The saying about a broken clock comes to mind.186 UK Over 130 Imams and Islamic Scholars Urge Johnson to Condemn Showing of Blasphemous Cartoons in School187 This is absurd beyond belief, yet indicative of the level of anti-British ideology that circulates among these Muslim leaders in Britain. It is also alarming that these leaders are brazen enough to operate within the UK as if they were in Sharia-adherent Pakistan, with its infamous blasphemy laws. These scholars need to be monitored carefully by authorities. One could only imagine what they are preaching in their mosques. Read more HERE about the uproar over and torment experienced by the teacher who exercised his right to offend, which is not hatred by any stretch of the normal imagination. Even the Archbishop of Canterbury can see the danger to Britain from Sharia blasphemy laws. Justin Welby recently reminded Britons In this country, we have to hold on to freedom of speech. 130 imams and scholars urge PM to condemn Batley school teacher, 5 Pillars, April 2, 2021.188 Why is There a Painting of a Nude Jesus Ministering to Judas in Pope Francis Study?189 According to the Vaticans own newspaper LOsservatore Romano, Pope Francis has placed a painting of a resurrected nude Jesus ministering to Judas, Christs own betrayer, behind the Popes desk in his personal study in the Vatican. The Vatican newspaper dedicated the first three pages of its Holy Thursday edition to Judas and called into question, as Pope Francis has done, Judas damnation. Although Pope Francis has, several times already, suggested that Judas is not in hell, that notion directly conflicts with statements of previous popes and Our Lord Himself, who said of Judas it would be better for him that he had not been born.190 Navy Seals Rescue Over a Thousand Trafficked Children and Dead Bodies Out of Shipping Containers in the Suez Canal.191 In an article titled, Trafficked Children, Bodies, Weapons Found on Evergreen Ship Blocking Suez Canal, by Judy Byington, 4-2-2021 it states that over a thousand trafficked children and dead bodies have been rescued out of shipping containers in the Suez Canal by US Navy Seals. Sources say that as of this writing, children were still being rescued and bodies discovered in Evergreens 18,000 containers. The containers were on an Evergreen Corporation ship that blocked the Canal from Tues. 23 March to Mon 29 March, causing billions in lost revenue to shipping companies internationally. The Seals also found Weapons of Mass Destruction on the six story high vessel  which were believed destined to start a war in the Middle East. Finally by Tues. the Evergreen cargo ship was loosened and taken to Bitter Lake in Egypt. By order of the Egyptian President, the containers were taken off the ship and searched by US Navy Seals. Many other ships that were blocked in the Suez Canal last week were also discovered to be carrying weapons  believed to be used to start a war in the Middle-East. Why? The weapons were going to be given to the Muslims by the Israel Mossad. Human traffickers were being arrested and cartels busted  losing critical income for their owners worldwide. The Deep State Operation was said to have lost 400 million  an hour while the ships were stuck for a week  that would pale in comparison to what those children were undergoing.192 Muslim Who Was Aboard Humanitarian Anti-Israel Mavi Marmara Flotilla in 2010 Charged With Aiding Jihad Terrorists193 No surprise here, except to the terminally blinkered. The people on the humanitarian Mavi Marmara flotilla were genocidal Jew-hating jihadis, as you can see in the above video they were chanting a jihad war cry recalling Muhammads massacre of the Jews of Arabia Khybar, Khybar, O Jews, the army of Muhammad will return. See the photos here of their weapons. But the Turks recast these jihadis as victims of supposedly unwarranted Israeli aggression, and even prevailed upon Obama to pressure the Israelis to apologize, which they never should have done. Only now is the full truth coming out.

The companies are being pressured to scrub from their websites language about corporate policies on human rights, reverse decisions to stop buying cotton produced in Xinjian, and remove maps that depict Taiwan as an independent country. The escalating fight comes after the European Union and the United Kingdom on March 22 joined the United States and Canada to impose sanctions on Chinese officials for human rights abuses in Xinjiang, a remote autonomous region in northwestern China.201 China Promises a Robust Response If U.S. Boycotts Beijing Olympics202 Following reports that the United States and a number of its allies were considering a boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics scheduled to be held in Beijing next year, the Chinese communist government warned the U.S. it would respond firmly if that were to happen.203 Cameroon Boko Haram Attacks Escalate in Far North204 Nairobi  The Islamist armed group Boko Haram has stepped up attacks on civilians in towns and villages in the Far North region of Cameroon since December 2020, killing at least 80 civilians, Human Rights Watch said today.

The Center Party is now increasingly viewed as part of the red-green bloc, which I see as deeply problematic, wrote the Swedish politician in a statement on Facebook. Former Member of Parliament Staffan Danielsson has made himself known as one of those who questioned Swedens notoriously liberal migration policy, which has been fingered as a major cause for the countries massive increase in gang shootings, organized crime, murders, and sexual assaults. While in the Center Party, Danielsson ordered a much-debated report on refugee unemployment.213 Gaslighting How Leftist Psychopaths Demonize and Demoralize Their Opposition214 Governments and other mainstream institutions always lie because psychopathic liars always infiltrate and overrun them. We have very few checks in place to prevent this, and very little is understood about psychopaths in the general public. To understand destructive institutions is to understand the character traits and methods of the psychopaths that control them. Psychopaths are not very complicated people nor are they all that intelligent, but they often succeed because they are relentless in their pursuits. The common signs of psychopathy include a complete lack of empathy, the obsessive desire for dominance, the use of physical or psychological violence to gain control over others, a narcissistic need to feel superior to everyone else and a habit of playing the victim while victimizing others. A common assumption about psychopaths is that they are incapable of working in a group or organizing for mutual gain. This is simply nonsense. In reality, numerous studies have shown that psychopaths are adept at finding their own kind in a crowd and even working together as a pack of predators. Some modern examples would be organized crime, cartels, sex traffickers, online scamming groups and religious cults. Almost all psychopaths are inherent cowards they will rarely pick on anyone their own size unless they have large numbers. The worst case scenario is fully realized organized psychopathy the advent of a totalitarian culture in which psychopathic behavior is rewarded and defended by those in authority or influence, while honesty, morality and liberty are punished.215 Twitch Plays Internet Police, Will Ban Users Accounts for Their Behavior Off the Platform216 Twitch has taken moral policing to a whole new level and is now deciding to ban users for their behavior outside of the platform.

Answer Because the first early cases of this are now showing up, and they need to lay the groundwork for blaming the virus entirely for whatever the vax does. If any of this is legit it is a bad omen, because it would mean the virus was not stable enough to hold onto its prions and even those who had no symptoms from the original may have a looming prion disease thats going to show its face in a few months. For those who have not seen this, as it turns out the protein the virus uses to bond with cells is the prion from mad cow disease, and the vax commands your body to make that prion. And that did not happen in a lab Things are going to get real interesting real quick, say, from this point in time, 3 4 months when the first cases start popping up.221 YouTube CEO Calls for Global Coalitions to Address Content Thats Legal But Could be Harmful222 During an appearance at the World Economic Forum Global Technology Governance Summit 2021, an event where more than 40 governments and 150 companies meet to ensure the responsible design and deployment of emerging technologies, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki expressed her support for tech platforms moderating content thats technically legal but could be harmful and praised global coalitions that help Big Tech coordinate and automate their censorship efforts. Wojcicki said that when tech companies comply with the law, there are still issues around speech and suggested that these issues should be addressed by private corporations. Comment I call for global coalitions to address tech censorship.223 YouTube CEO Its Easy to Make Up Content and Post it From Your Basement So We Boost Authoritative Sources224 YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki has acknowledged that the platforms policy of boosting authoritative mainstream media sources and suppressing independent creators in search makes it harder, in some cases, for channels, maybe who are getting started or smaller, to be able to be visible when theres a major event or when people are looking at something that is science or news related but insists that that the policy is really, really important. Wojcicki made the comments during an interview with The Atlantics CEO, Nicholas Thompson, at the World Economic Forums Global Technology Governance Summit 2021.225 AP Wording Suggests Vehicle Killed Capitol Police Veteran, Not Murderer Behind the Wheel226 The Associated Press was criticized for how it worded a tweet about the U.S. Capitol Police veteran who was killed last week, shifting the blame onto the vehicle rather than the murderer behind the wheel. As soon as news broke of an attack on the Capitol on Friday, leftist commentators rushed to blame white people as they do after every single mass shooting or act of violence. However, the culprit was soon named as 25-year-old Noah Green, a black Nation of Islam follower. He was shot dead by cops after launching a vehicle and knife attack that left Officer William Evans fighting for his life. Evans subsequently succumbed to his injuries in hospital. According to the AP, Green didnt ram the vehicle into Evans, the vehicle apparently controlled itself.227  1  2 449472  3 449504  4 449466  5 449404  6 449372  7 449446  8 449444  9 449440  10 449460  11 449370  12 449410  13 449361  14 449434  15 449430  16 449422  17 449406  18 449442  19 449396  20 449436  21 449408  22 449360  23 449359  24 449380  25 449428  26 449390  27 449474  28 449365  29 449376  30 449424  31 449438  32 449476  33 449450  34 449448  35 449394  36 449418  37 449392  38 449382  39 449420  40 449500  41 449398  42 449494  43 449454  44 449480  45 449492  46 449414  47 449468  48 449478  49 449456  50 449506  51 449502  52 449374  53 449458  54 449490  55 449400  56 449498  57 449488  58 449378  59 449386  60 449486  61 449363  62 449484  63 449412  64 449432  65 449482  66 449402  67 449426  68 449496  69 449452  70 449388  71 449464  72 449368  73 449384  74 449462  75 449470  76 449416  77  78 topheadline  79  80 topheadline  81  82 topheadline  83  84 topheadline  85  86 topheadline  87  88 topheadline  89  90 topheadline  91  92 topheadline  93  94 topheadline  95  96 topheadline  97  98 topheadline  99  100 topheadline  101  102 topheadline  103  104 topheadline  105  106 topheadline  107  108 topheadline  109  110 topheadline  111  112 topheadline  113  114 topheadline  115  116 topheadline  117  118 topheadline  119  120 topheadline  121  122 topheadline  123  124 topheadline  125  126 topheadline  127  128 topheadline  129  130 topheadline  131  132 topheadline  133  134 topheadline  135  136 topheadline  137  138 topheadline  139  140 topheadline  141  142 topheadline  143  144 topheadline  145  146 topheadline  147  148 topheadline  149  150 topheadline  151  152 topheadline  153  154 topheadline  155  156 topheadline  157  158 topheadline  159  160 topheadline  161  162 topheadline  163  164 topheadline  165  166 topheadline  167  168 topheadline  169  170 topheadline  171  172 topheadline  173  174 topheadline  175  176 topheadline  177  178 topheadline  179  180 topheadline  181  182 topheadline  183  184 topheadline  185  186 topheadline  187  188 topheadline  189 38utm_campaignstandard  190 topheadline  191  192 topheadline  193  194 topheadline  195  196  197 topheadline  198  199 topheadline  200  201 topheadline  202  203 topheadline  204  205 topheadline  206  207 topheadline  208  209 topheadline  210  211 topheadline  212  213 topheadline  214  215 topheadline  216  217 topheadline  218  219 topheadline  220  221 topheadline  222  223 topheadline  224  225 topheadline  226  227 topheadline",homeless

Stevens On Saturday, protests erupted outside the Columbia Sportswear store in Portland, Oregon, forcing it to close. The protesters were responding to an open letter that CEO Tim Boyle had written about safety concerns around the companys office. Some saw it as an attack on the neighborhoods homeless population. Protesters are not happy with Columbia Sportswears weighing in on Portlands social ills. Roughly 50 people descended on the brands flagship location in Portland, Oregon, on Saturday, forcing the store to close, according to The Oregonian.1 The protest was in response to an editorial2 that Tim Boyle, the companys CEO and president, published in The Oregonian in November.",homeless
portland,Protesters swarmed a Columbia Sportswear store after its CEO said the company may close its office due to safety concerns,2017-12-04T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,The Oregonian,"The letter announced that the company would consider moving its one-year-old office in downtown Portland, which is used by its Sorel brand. Boyle said he would make the decision in the next 90 days. Safety concerns have arisen as some employees said they received death threats from nearby panhandlers. A few days ago, one of our employees had to run into traffic when a stranger outside our office followed her and threatened to kill her. On other occasions our employees have arrived at work only to be menaced by individuals camping in the doorway, the letter read. Our employees have had so many car break-ins downtown that we have started referring to parking in Portland as our laptop donation program. The letter went on to call for more to be done to make Portlands downtown area safer, including a greater police presence and more attention to the issue from city government. The editorial received a swift response from Portlands civic leadership. Signs around downtown now say that loitering is prohibited, and that the sidewalk is for pedestrian movement only  a reference to Portlands no-sit policy, according to The Oregonian. Though the letter itself did not mention homelessness at all, some in the Portland community interpreted the signs and the letter as an attack on an already-vulnerable population. We think its disgusting that a CEO that happened to give so much money to Mayor Ted Wheelers campaign can write an op-ed and instantly these signs go up that no one is allowed to sit in front of his business, Gregory McKelvey, the founder of Portlands Resistance, the group that organized the protest, told NBC affiliate KGW News3. We shouldnt be criminalizing things homeless people need to do to survive. Protesters held signs with slogans like Homelessness is a last resort, not a crime and Making hardship harder wont make it go away. In a statement released on Saturday, Wheeler said Its irresponsible to conflate homelessness and crime. We can address safety issues with common sense enforcement. We can address homelessness with compassion. Thats our plan. The store reopened on Sunday, but the protesters say they may be back. In response to the protests, Columbia released a statement from Boyle A couple of weeks ago, Columbia Sportswear Company delivered a truckload of coats to Transition Projects, an important nonprofit that assists homeless individuals in Portland, and our team participated in TV interviews stressing the importance of providing support for communities in need. The same day, I published an opinion piece in The Oregonian urging city leaders to address urgent safety issues in downtown Portland in part by providing resources for community policing. My opinion piece in The Oregonian did not address homelessness generally. The word does not appear in the article, because the concerns about safety are not tied solely to that issue. The call for community policing resources got far more attention, but the spotlight needs to be much broader. You would be hard-pressed to name all the agencies and enterprises who are involved in some way in these inter-related issues. There are issues that touch the state, the city, the county, and there are no doubt resources being spent by public bodies that no one thinks of in connection with homelessness. At times Portlanders seem to be talking past each other, choosing one side or another to what is inherently a multi-sided issue. We can and should - and We do - show compassion to support individuals in need. At the same time, we can and should provide resources for law enforcement to provide greater safety for all. While this a challenging situation, I refuse to give up, and I would encourage all Oregonians to devote time, attention, and, yes, resources to address the complex issues surrounding homelessness. In meetings with local and state leaders in recent months I have offered to contribute personally to genuine solutions  not policing  and I have reiterated my belief that others in the business community should join this effort. I am glad to call business leaders personally to ask them to contribute. We cannot solve all problems, and we will likely never address all the needs related to homelessness, but as Oregonians we can make meaningful progress if our leaders business, government, nonprofits and others have the will to do so.

The fact of the matter is simple central banks are hopelessly trapped. Henrich says that its only a matter of time before investors learn the hard way that this sudden capitulation by central bankers is not a positive sign, but rather a sign of desperation. In a recent article he wrote for his website Northmantrader.com, Henrich says this economic manipulation by the central banks is all going to end badly. Even some ardent bulls will freely admit this, the question is the how, when and the where. Frankly, its a tragedy thats unfolding and discerning eyes can see it. Since the December lows markets have taken the scripted route higher salivating at the prospect of dovish central bankers once again levitating asset prices higher, Henrich wrote. He also tweeted that this is all a shell game in which central banks are trapped.85 Globalists Are Bringing Their One World Currency Plans Out Into the Open86 People often ask me when they should begin to worry about the agenda for the global economic reset and the controlled demolition of the economy? If economic collapse is a process rather than an event, at what point in the process will we start to feel direct consequences? While crash conditions in economic fundamentals have indeed already started in the final quarter of 2018, culminating in faltering housing and retail numbers as well as an inverted yield curve, the average person is only affected so far in a minor way. Its true  even during the greatest of financial depressions, only a part of the population suffers while the rest live somewhat normally. This relativity in crisis changes, though, when we start talking about a currency collapse. In the event that the primary mechanism for exchange becomes unstable, as in Weimar Germany in the 1920s or in Argentina in the early 2000s, the damage to the public is almost universal except for the elitist class. In the midst of stagflationary headwinds, many people could still live a comfortable life given they are willing to make some sacrifices. But, in the midst of a currency implosion, anyone who is ill prepared will have to face the pain. As far as timing is concerned, we can make educated guesses according to the evidence, but there is no exact science to predicting when the globalists will pull the plug completely on economic life support. They will trigger a disaster when the timing most suits them. However, I do believe there are signals to watch for. In the past I have said that when globalist criminals stop trying to hide their criminality  when they start to become brazen in their rhetoric and agenda, that is when it is time for people to worry. Why? Because when criminals act more confident it is usually because they think they have already gotten away with it. Their plans are almost complete. Over the past year, the globalists have become absolutely brazen in flaunting their endgame for a single global currency system. Yes, it is time to be concerned. But there are people out there who will tell you that the notion is far fetched. They will tell you that it is doom porn, and they will tell you it is conspiracy theory. The evidence says otherwise. The evidence says it is conspiracy FACT But before global governance can be instilled as a necessity in the public psyche and the banking elites established as the benevolent rulers of the planet, several things must be accomplished. One of the first steps to global government would be global economic management and a single world currency. After this is achieved, global government would become much easier to sell to the public. Beyond this, the idea that the globalists have total control already is nonsense. The big secret the establishment does not want you to know about is that elitist power hangs by a thin thread, and that thread is public inaction and distraction. The establishment spends trillions of dollars and thousands of man-hours developing propaganda and launching wars in order to keep the populace preoccupied exactly because their control is an illusion. All it would take is for a marginal percentage of people to wake up one day and suddenly decide to grab their torches and pitchforks or maybe sniper rifles in a modern hypothetical scenario and start snuffing out the tiny faction of elites in highest positions. Their control would vanish, and they would be hiding in the deepest holes they could find. Sure, others could take their place, but why would they want to when making the attempt would be a potential death sentence?

She just had a panel of bank CEOs in front of her and tried her tactic of grilling them but it didnt turn out as shed planned. In fact, it turned out to be a very, very embarrassing moment for the career politician. Watch Maxine question each banker and then get the wake-up call from J.P. Morgans CEO that shes clueless Maxine Waters had no idea that banks stopped student loans in 2010! In fact, she voted for HR 4872 in 2010! Learn more about RevenueStripe The government took over those loans and loaning so is she saying that the government needs to fix a problem they took over in 2010?89 The Feds 5G Blockchain Enslavement Plan90 Last September I wrote an article pondering the possibility that cryptocurrencies and blockchain may serve as a red herring gateway to a global 5G-driven electronic implantable currency controlled by the same Rothschild-led central bankers who control all other global monetary assets. A quick look at the website of a company called Digital Currency Group DCG may convince you that its true. It appears they own the entire blockchain and cryptocurrency space. DCG is, according to its own website, The epicenter of the bitcoin and blockchain industry. Former Treasury Secretary and New York Fed insider Larry Summers is an advisor to the DCG board, whose members include Lawrence Lenihan, Glenn Hutchins, and Barry Silbert. Lenihan is a former IBM insider, who co-developed the companys first transactional interactive multimedia software kiosk products. He once served as chairman of the Duke University Pratt School of Engineering Devil Venture Fund. He is also on the boards of Body Labs and TraceLink. Body Labs is a software provider of human-aware artificial intelligence that understands the 3D body shape and motion of people from RGB photos or videos. Lenihan provided start-up capital for Body Labs from his FirstMark Capital fund, which he started after his stint at IBM. Their focus is Big Data and AI. Body Labs was purchased by Amazon in 2017 and will play a key role in the development of 5G smart surveillance cameras. TraceLink calls itself a life sciences cloud that specializes in, global track ...ace, global compliance, and digital supply chain. They work closely with Big Pharma and the hospital chains. TraceLink has the technology which could be used to track ...ace human microchip recipients.91 He Was Just Gushing Blood Man in MAGA Hat Retaliates Against Hat Flipper  Using a Samurai Sword92 Following a spate of violence and harassment directed towards Trump supporters wearing MAGA hats, one man retaliated with a samurai sword. 30-year-old Leor Bergland of San Francisco was arrested last Wednesday in connection with a March 29 incident in which an assailant who knocked his Make America Great Again hat off was slashed with a sword at around 10 p.m. according to NBC News. Bergland has a criminal record and lives in a San Francisco supportive housing complex for formerly homeless people.93 30 Inches of Snow! Another Bomb Cyclone Detonates Over the Midwest, And the NOAA is Warning Flooding Could Extend Into July94 We arent supposed to have a major blizzard in April. Less than a month after a bomb cyclone caused apocalyptic flooding in the central part of the country, another bomb cyclone is hitting the exact same area. One meteorologist has called it a life-threatening storm, and at this moment over four million people are under blizzard warnings. South Dakota, Minnesota, Nebraska and Kansas are going to get absolutely hammered before the storm finally moves east on Friday. The authorities are warning that this new bomb cyclone will cause additional flooding in the region, but at this point we do not know how bad that flooding will be. The good news is that the ground has been softened up by warmer weather since the last bomb cyclone, and that should mean that more of the moisture is absorbed before it flows into the major rivers. But the bad news is that we are being told that this storm could break records. The following comes from the Daily Mail95 A Roberts-Kavanaugh Bromance?96 Conservatives takeover of Supreme Court stalled by John Roberts-Brett Kavanaugh bromance. Thats the headline of a story in USA Today. The author explains Chief Justice John Roberts and the courts newest member, Brett Kavanaugh, have voted in tandem on nearly every case thats come before them since Kavanaugh joined the court in October. Theyve been more likely to side with the courts liberal justices than its other conservatives. The two justices, both alumni of the same District of Columbia-based federal appeals court, have split publicly only once in 25 official decisions. Their partnership has extended, though less reliably, to orders the court has issued on abortion funding, immigration and the death penalty in the six months since Kavanaughs bitter Senate confirmation battle ended in a 50-48 vote. I discussed the Roberts-Kavanaugh alliance in connection with the Courts unwillingness to hear cases regarding Planned Parenthood and, at least so far, to hear key cases regarding the rights of gays and transgender individuals. The three solidly conservative Justices  Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch  all have voted to hear these cases, but it takes the vote of a fourth Justice to make this happen. Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kavanaugh have held out. What is Kavanaughs up to? USA Today says that, having been accused of a 1980s sexual assault during his confirmation process, he may just be laying low.  NOTE Another disappointing outcome for social conservatives.97 Castro I Support Things Like Gun Buybacks  Theyre Good Policy,  In Some Circumstances98 During a town hall on CNN on Thursday, 2020 presidential candidate, former HUD Secretary, and former San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro D expressed support for universal background checks, banning people who have committed domestic violence from getting guns, and magazine capacity limits, and said that gun buybacks are sound policy in certain circumstances. Castro said, We need to make background checks universal. Theres no reason that somebody who has committed domestic violence should ever get their hands on a gun, right? We also need to limit the capacity of magazines, and we need to make sure that we do everything that we can so that people who get their hands on guns do so in a safe way. So, you know, I support making sure that we make those background checks universal. I support things like gun buybacks. I know that they have had mixed success, but I believe that, in some circumstances, thats a good policy, and that we can recover some weapons that shouldnt be out there on the street. Castro continued that suicides committed with firearms need to be part of the conversation, and we need better investments in mental health. Comment Castro, an appropriate name.99 Confidence in Higher Education Plummets Gallup100 Confidence in higher education in the United States has dropped significantly since 2015, according to polling company Gallup, which notes that its the worst-performing institution they measure. The crisis in confidence coincides with a similar decline in the publics view that higher education is affordable and available to those who need it, according to the report  suggesting that affordability and access are linked to the faith people have in the institution of higher learning.101 Controversial Speaker Milo Yiannopoulos Possibly to Speak at TCC, Officials Say102 TULSA  Tulsa Community College officials said theyve received a facilities rental request for an event that possibly would feature controversial commentator Milo Yiannopoulos.103 Crenshaw Calls Out Omar for Describing 911 Attacks as Some People Did Something104 Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar is facing backlash after her speech at a Muslim rights groups event in which she described the September 11, 2001 terror attacks as some people did something. Omar spoke at a Council on American-Islamic Relations CAIR fundraiser last month, where she called upon other Muslim Americans to make people uncomfortable with their activism and presence in the society and criticized the Jewish state. But another part of the speech surfaced on social media earlier this week, in which Omar described the terror attacks perpetrated by al Qaeda. CAIR was founded after 911 because they recognized that some people did something, and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties, Omar said at the event. The comments from the Minnesota freshman Democrat, still reeling from a number of anti-Semitic controversies, prompted Texas Rep. Dan Crenshaw to slam Omar for her description of the terror attacks. First Member of Congress to ever describe terrorists who killed thousands of Americans on 911 as some people who did something, Crenshaw wrote in a tweet. Unbelievable.105 Electoral College Protects All Americans Against the Tyranny of the Majority106 According to the National Conference of State Legislators, 13 states plus the District of Columbiaall of which currently are bluewith a total of 184 electoral votes, have passed NPVC legislation The Electoral College is one of the most critical institutions created by the Framers of the Constitution to ensure a stable representative government, yet its under attack. Eliminating or effectively neutering the Electoral Collegethe two options being proposed by many Democratswould fundamentally alter the country, which, of course, is exactly what progressives are hoping to do. This would be grievously wrong! Lets start with the basics of our American system, which is, by design, unlike any other. States, not individuals, are the original source of power. The states13 of them, anywaycreated the federal government. Less-populated states were understandably concerned they would be overshadowed by the larger ones, so they demanded protections within the Constitution. Giving every state, regardless of size, two senators was one of those protections. The Electoral College was another. Both concessions were intended to protect the minority against what is sometimes referred to as the tyranny of the majority, the concern that in a pure democracy the majority can do whatever it wants, regardless of how badly it might harm the minority. The Framers did their best to create a representative political system that minimized the potential for a tyranny of the majority. They largely achieved their goal, though progressives have been successfully chipping away at those protections for decades. Comment NPVC should be illegal. It is an end run around the electoral college system. 107 Georgetown University Undergraduate Students Vote to Pay 27 Per-Semester Fee for Slavery Reparations to Benefit Descendants of Slaves Sold by the School in the 1800s108 Georgetown University students have voted in favor of a referendum seeking the establishment of a fund that benefits the descendants of enslaved people who were sold by the school in the 1800s to pay off its debts. The 27.20-per-semester fee would create one of the first reparations funds at a major U.S. institution. More than 2,500 undergraduate students at the Washington D.C. campus voted in favor on Thursday for the Reconciliation Contribution fee. The Georgetown University Student Association Elections Commission said those in favor 2,541 represented 66 per cent of votes. The fee was opposed by 1,304 students and voting turnout was 57.9 percent.109 Gmail Making Email More Secure With MTA-STS Standard110 Were excited to announce that Gmail will become the first major email provider to follow the new SMTP MTA Strict Transport Security MTA-STS RFC 8461 and SMTP TLS Reporting RFC 8460 internet standards. Those new email security standards are the result of three years of collaboration within IETF, with contributions from Google and other large email providers.111 Health Freedom is Being Destroyed All Over the Western World112 They tell us that we are free, but it is just a lie. In every country in the western world, there is layer after layer of rules and regulations that strictly govern just about every area of our lives. But until just recently, there were certain lines that still had not been crossed. One of those lines has to do with bodily integrity. We have a fundamental right to say what goes into our bodies and what doesnt go into our bodies. When any government violates that fundamental right, no matter how good the intentions are, they have entered the realm of tyranny. And let there be no doubt  what is taking place in New York City right now is tyranny. On Tuesday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio used the pretense of a public health emergency to order mandatory vaccinations for all of the Orthodox Jews living in Williamsburg Those who have not received the vaccine or do not have evidence of immunity may be given a violation and could be fined 1,000. Is this still America? I am having a hard time believing that this is actually happening. There is no way that people would have ever put up with such nonsense 40 or 50 years ago. Even New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, is admitting that this effort to force mandatory vaccinations on city residents may be unconstitutional113 High School Suspends 2 Students for Posting Gun Range Photos on Snapchat, ACLU Files Suit114 Two male students at Lacey Township High School in New Jersey posted photos of guns on Snapchat. One of the boys captioned his photo with hot stuff and if theres ever a zombie apocalypse, you know where to go. The photos were not taken at school. They were not taken during school hours. They did not reference a school. They auto-deleted after 24 hours, which was well before the school became aware of them. And yet, administrators at Lacey Township High School suspended the boys for three days, and also gave them weekend detention. This was a clear violation of the students First Amendment rights, and the American Civil Liberties Union has now filed suit.115 Hillary Clinton Laughs ...kes at Arrest of Julian Assange116 Hillary Clinton responded to the arrest of Julian Assange by laughing and joking about it. Clinton claimed that Assanges arrest had nothing to do with journalism and that the Wikileaks founder has to answer for what he has done, at least as its been charged.117 Joe Biden is Not Moderate. Hes Far, Far Left.118 Laughably, Biden is talked about as the moderate Democrat candidate for president. To be sure, Biden has a far better persona than any of the other candidates. Biden is the far-left extremist you can take home to meet your tradition-minded grandparents. Biden will charm your neighborhood backyard party while flipping steaks on the grill. Biden is the national Democrat you would most like to have a few beers and pizza with, regardless of political beliefs. In other words, Biden is the best fake. Biden is a liberal from a time when anti-American, at-war-with-reality, and even communist revolutionaries learned to hide who they really are. The only thing that has changed is that Democrats have decided that it is better now to be open and honest about their radical beliefs and agendas. Most Democrats have stopped pretending. Biden is still pretending.119 Marcus Democrats Cant Win Based on Their Ideas, So They Want to Change the Rules of the Game120 One of the biggest criticisms of President Trump is that he violates so-called democratic norms. Leading Democrats, think tank officials, and newspaper columnists have continuously wrung their hands over how everything from Trumps tweets to his legitimate criticisms of the mainstream media somehow threatens American governing institutions. Trump has assailed essential institutions and traditions claims a left-wing outfit in a report issued this year. Yet these same groups are conspicuously silent on Democrats blatant and unapologetic attempts to subvert U.S. founding institutions in their lust for power that they cannot achieve through the existing governing framework. In recent weeks, Democrats have called for abolishing the countrys constitutional voting system, allowing children to vote, and packing the Supreme Court.121 Microsoft Yanks Code After Some PCs Are Rendered Super Secure And Unbootable Following Update122 Sophos, Avast users left wailing as update borks older OSes A bunch of PCs running the wares of Sophos or Avast have been freezing or failing to start following the installation of patches emitted by Microsoft on 9 April. The afflicted are those running Windows 8.1, 7, Server 2008 R2 and Server 2012. Avast for Business and Cloudcare have been hit by the problem, as have PCs running Endpoint Protection managed by Sophos Central or Sophos Enterprise Console SEC. Microsoft said this morning that it had temporarily blocked devices from receiving this update if the Sophos Endpoint is installed, a move which, sadly, had come a bit late for those afflicted.123 NYC Pricks Even Cuomo Pushes Back on DeBlasio124 After a judge overthrew a NY Countys quarantine on people who arent sick but simply havent had a vaccine, now NYC Mayor DeBlasio attacks a religious community in NY with threats of 1,000 fines. Even Gov Cuomo has had enough.125 Oregon Man Fidel Lopez Sentenced to 60 Days in Jail After Raping Small Dog126 An Oregon man named Fidel Lopez was handed the maximum sentence for raping a dog that later had to be euthanized, a report says. The 52-year-old suspect was arrested after his girlfriend became worried that he had attacked her small Lhasa apso after the dog began whimpering and hiding underneath a couch, the Oregonian reported. A police report says that when the dog was inspected, it was found injured and bloody. The woman asked the police to perform a rape kit on the animal and said that her boyfriend had talked of his interest in bestiality. According to officials, the suspects DNA was found among the dogs wounds. The animal was so injured that it was eventually euthanized. Lopez was arrested and later handed a 60-day jail sentence for raping the dog. The sentence is the maximum allowable by state law.127 Oregons SB-978 Gun Control Bill is So Hysterically Restrictive That Pepper Spray is a Felony128 A new gun control bill introduced in the Oregon State Legislature added 45 pages of draconian amendments the night before the vote. SB978 passed the Judiciary Committee yesterday and now heads to the Oregon Senate. Its a good thing that some parts of this state have vowed to be 2A sanctuaries because Oregonians are going to need them. If the gun owners  and even pepper spray owners  in other parts of the state hope to defend themselves, they could be facing a vast new array of felony charges. The battle for the right to bear arms is rapidly spreading across the country. In February,the House of Representatives passed two sweeping national bills. New Mexico has passed 6 outrageous new laws that sheriffs are refusing to enforce, and sheriffs in Washington state are also rebelling. On the other stand, two states have introduced invasive laws requiring would-be gun owners to hand over access to years of personal social media. Whats in the unconstitutional bill, you ask? Well, lets get started.129 Peak TDS?

Now for the Interesting Bit  How All That Raw Data Was Stored134 The black hole image released yesterday needed over a thousand helium-filled disk drives to record it. Regular drives were tried and tested but failed due to air pressure at the high altitudes of the radio telescope sites. Eight radio telescopes at six locations formed the Event Horizon Telescope EHT array, which contributed the data used to calculate the image of the black hole in the Messier 87 galaxy Hawaii James Clerk Maxwell Telescope and Submillimeter Array at an altitude of 4,092m Mexico Large Millimeter Telescope Alfonso Serrano 4,600m Arizona Submillimeter Telescope 3,185m Spain IRAM NOEMA observatory, Sierra Nevada 2,850m Chile APEX 5,100m and ALMA 5,000m telescopes, Atacama Desert Antarctica South Pole Telescope 2,800m EHT_telescope_sites In effect, they simulated a single radio telescope the size of planet Earth. The telescopes take images as Earth rotates to build a picture of the target area taken from different locations on the surface of the planet. The technique used to combine the signals is called very-long-baseline interferometry VLBI, at a wavelength of 1.3mm, which uses hydrogen maser atomic clocks to precisely time stamp the raw image data. A specially developed algorithm combined and correlated the raw data to build the single overall image.135 SPLC, ADL, And the White Nationalism Panic136 Alarmist organizations encourage social media censors to claim that there is a surge in hate across the West A cluster of events this past week marked a steepening in the upwards trend toward online censorship. In a New York TimesSouthern Poverty Law Center SPLC collaborative report about online extremism, authors claimed the social media sphere enabled a global network of white extremists to develop and that this has led to a surge of white supremacist and xenophobic terrorism in the West. Although grasping in its conclusions and broadly flawed, the report was no doubt a clear enough justification for many to continue the culling of speech freedoms online. In a near-identical report of its own, the Anti-Defamation League ADL described certain social media platforms having apparently become round-the-clock digital white supremacist rallies. They too conclude more policing from both industry and government had to be done. Both reports coincided with social media executives themselves being called to a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee where it was demanded that they do more to stem white nationalist propaganda and hate speech online. The report seems to have uncovered not so much a surge in social media-enabled violence but the pervasiveness of social media in peoples everyday lives and the ease with which ones online reading and communication habits and criminal motives can be ascertained.137 There is No Going Back if You Step Over the Windows 10 20H1 Threshold138 Fast Ringers keen to extricate themselves from the Windows Insider programme have missed their chance for a quieter life as Microsoft booted them into the 2020s with build 18875. Before today, Microsofts platoon of unpaid Fast Ring testers could have switched away without needing a reinstall, but no more. Like the vampire of yore, if the 20H1 build is allowed over the threshold, there will be no going back without a stake to the heart of your PC.139 Top NFL Draft Pick Deletes Pro-Trump, Conservative Social Media Posts to Avoid Being Penalized in Upcoming Draft140 Yesterday, the New York Post hailed Ohio State defensive end Nick Bosa as the best player in the NFL draft, saying that it would be remarkable if Bosa fell to the Jets in the NFL draft. The NFL draft will take place in Nashville on April 25th. One hour later, they published an article about how Bosa removed all of his social media posts that reflected his conservative views. Bosa claims he removed them over his concern about affecting his chances with the San Francisco 49ers in the NFL draft. New York Post reports  Nick Bosa has wiped some of his Twitter slate clean. The Ohio State defensive end, who is projected to be one of the top picks in this months NFL draft, told ESPN he deleted certain posts, including a 2016 tweet in which he called former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick a clown, due to his potential landing spot.141 Climate Strange Owing to Flight Shame, Some Swedes Feel Too Guilty to Fly142 What a civilization feels guilty about speaks volumes. In Sweden, its not stealing children and putting them in abusive foster care, proposing a special tax on just one sex, trying to compel boys to tinkle sitting down, or silencing dissent with hate-speech laws. But pangs of conscience over flying on airplanes and increasing your Carbon Footprinttm are a different story. In fact, Swedes even have a name for such shame Flygskam pronounced fleegskaam.143 Coffee Not Essential for Life, Swiss Government Says144 The Swiss government wants to put an end to its emergency stockpile of coffee after declaring that it is not essential for human survival. Switzerland began storing emergency reserves of coffee between World War One and World War Two in preparation for potential shortages. It continued in subsequent decades to combat shortages sparked by war, natural disasters or epidemics. It now hopes to end the practice by late 2022. But opposition is mounting.145 Cox Govt Will Listen To Second Referendum Demands, EU Leaders Hope Long Delay Will Lead to Vote146 Attorney-General Geoffrey Cox has said there are no preconditions on a potential Brexit deal with Labour, and that the Tories will of course discuss the possibility of a second referendum.147 EU Calls Project Gutenberg Archive, 15 Million Ebooks, Grateful Dead Recordings and Prelinger Archive Terrorism,  Demands Removal From Internet Archive148 In the past week, Europol and the French governments LOffice Central de Lutte contre la Criminalit lie aux Technologies de lInformation et de la Communication OCLCTIC have sent 500 terrorism takedown demands to the Internet Archive demanding the removal of tens of millions of works the entire archive of Project Gutenberg an archive of 15 million texts, the entire Grateful Dead archive, the Prelinger Archive of public domain industrial films much beloved by the MTV generation as they were the source of the channels classic interstitial animations, and the Archives collection of recordings from CSPAN. The takedowns come in just as the EU is getting ready to vote on a proposal that will force platforms to remove terrorist content within one hour or face censorship through national firewalls, fines, and criminal sanctions. Even if it was possible for the Internet Archive to sift through tens of millions of documents in a collection targeted by one of these takedowns in one hour to figure out if the takedown notice is valid, the timezone problem means that they would have to be ready to do this in the middle of the night in San Francisco, when the EU agencies most typically send their demands. Even without this absurd law, the situation is dire. The French authorities gave the Internet Archive 24 hours to comply with its demand or face a nationwide block.149 Fake Newstatesman Scruton Fires Back After Leftist Hit Job, Tory Back-Stab150 Sir Roger Scruton, the United Kingdoms pre-eminent conservative philosopher, has held firm after the left-wing New Statesman published an interview parsed to make him look like a bigot, resulting in the Tory government sacking him from his role on the Building Better, Building Beautiful architectural commission.151 Farages Secret Weapon Annunziata Rees-Mogg Defects From Tories to Join New Brexit Party152 Annunziata Rees-Mogg joined Nigel Farage on stage on Friday to confirm she would be standing as Brexit Party candidate in the European Parliament elections to help rescue our democracy and return the power of Government to the people.

The lesson is clear if you plan to seek asylum in a foreign embassy, you should be careful to choose the diplomatic premises of a country a not likely to be pressurized into betraying you and b comfortable enough to make a long sojourn tolerable. The 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations reaffirmed the long-established principle of inviolability of diplomatic premises. The host-countrys police and security forces are not allowed access without a specific authorization of the chief of mission, which was granted in this case. Assange had spent almost seven years in the Ecuadorian embassy, after being welcomed there by the countrys former president Rafael Correa. The hosts political calculus has changed to his detriment over the past two years, however. The British police arrested Assange supposedly for skipping UK bail seven years ago, but alsoand far more importantlyunder a previously secret U.S. indictment. The exact charge is for conspiracy, with Chelsea Manning, to hack into a classified U.S. government computer. Assange lawyer Barry Pollock said the allegations boil down to encouraging a source to provide him information and taking efforts to protect the identity of that source. Assange had predicted that this would happen years ago, and stated it as his reason for seeking asylum in the first place. Sen. Joe Manchin D, W.V. gloated He is our property! when told of Assanges arrest, and he accurately reflected the sentiment shared by the entire Beltway swamp, Democrats in particular161 Londons Uber, Cab Drivers Catch Yellow Vests Bug, Rail Against Fossil Fuel Taxes162 Authored by Chloe Anagnos via The American Institute for Economic Research Also known as the yellow-vests movement, the gilets jaunes movement in France gets a lot of hate from the left-leaning media. To critics, climate change requires government action, and if that means the working class will have to endure more poverty and misery, thats just how it is. But as the gilets jaunes message spreads far and wide, the sentiment against fossil fuel taxes is becoming the strongest in neighboring England. And as a new environmental policy goes into effect this month, cab and Uber drivers protest, claiming that charges associated with the new rules will cut their earnings in a meaningful way.163 Norwegian Newspaper Bets on Arabic to Attract Readership, Locals Sceptical164 With its novel new offer, Vesterlen Online hopes to entice more readers, as the region has many immigrant speakers of Arabic, according to its editor Geir Bjørn Nilsen.

He told his audience that the White House has been shocked by the utter disaster of the Tory-led Brexit process, and that its a shame lawmakers inside the Westminster Bubble have failed to understand the will of the voters, Farage said. There are several people in the American administration American administration who are looking on with incredulity that what they thought was a great country suddenly is being humbled by foreign bureaucrats. But some of Farages most scathing criticism was reserved for Prime Minister Theresa May, whom he declared the worst prime minister in my lifetime, as well as the most duplicitous. I cant believe she has ever been involved in any negotiation of any kind at any point in her life. She is without doubt the worst Prime Minister in my lifetime and the most duplicitous  she says one thing and does the other again and again and again. The British people, particularly those who voted for Brexit, are being treated with disdain, Farage said. And the feeling that the Kingdoms politics has broken down has become pervasive.173 UK Half of Londoners Find City Life Too Stressful, One Third Complain of Cost of Living174 A poll has found that a quarter of Londoners feel they have no choice but to move out, with some citing the high cost of living, stress, and low quality of life in the city.

All you need is the Bitcoin Wallet Address that has been set up by Wikileaks to see how much the fund has raised.

Donations began pouring in during the 24 hours following Assanges arrest. It represents a demonstration of financial support from the libertarian Bitcoin community, which has had a strong link with Assange and Wikileaks for nearly a decade. Wikileaks was one of the first organizations to start accepting Bitcoin, which it did in 2010, after traditional pay services like PayPal and Visa withdrew support. The Wikileaks Defence Fund accepts donations in a number of non-traditional currencies, including Bitcoin and Zcash. Those wishing to support can also donate by sending money via bank transfer, MasterCard, Visa, Amex and Discover.177 WikiLeaks Document Dumps That Shook the World178 Wikileaks founder Julian Assange was arrested on Thursday at Ecuadors London embassy, where he had been granted asylum since 2012.

India has asked Washington to clarify whether US military personnel were present at bases from where Pakistan Air Force PAF F-16 fighter jets were deployed to the 27 February air battle between the two countries warplanes, the Economic Times reports. The Indian newspaper cited unnamed sources as saying that the Pakistani military had allegedly asked all American personnel to leave the Pakistani bases as they were preparing for forward deployment. US officials are yet to comment on the issue. While Pakistan claims that it downed two IAF MiG-21 planes during the dogfight, India insists that the IAF only lost one plane and that its forces managed to down a PAF F-16  an aircraft that was provided to Islamabad by the US. The American jets were supposed to be used in the fight against terrorism which is why Delhi urges Washington, which still maintains a wait-and-see attitude, to respond to the wrong use of the combat aircraft, the Indian government said.185 India Tens of Millions Vote on First Day of Worlds Largest Democratic Elections186 Tens of millions in India cast their ballots on Thursday, the beginning of the first phase of the colossal general elections in the country, home to the worlds most populous democracy where Prime Minister Narendra Modis Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party BJP is already considered the front-runner.

See if your state is on the list The Eleventh Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that colleges in Georgia are not required to admit illegal immigrant students. The decision further sparked a national conversation about the rights of Dreamers, as well as the legality of offering them in-state tuition benefits, which usually allow students attending college in their home states to pay far less than their peers from different states. Citing US Code 1623, which states that anyone who is not legally a citizen cannot be entitled to any benefit that is denied to a citizen of the United States, some have questioned whether those here illegally should be offered in-state tuition rates that arent available to other students who are citizens. Currently, 18 states, offer some form of a pathway for in-state tuition to those living here illegally. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 18 states  California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Washington  offer in-state tuition to illegal immigrant students. Two more states  Oklahoma and Rhode Island  offer in-state tuition to illegal immigrant students, pending approval from the Board of Regents.205 2020 Julian Castro We Need Migrants More Than Ever Before206 Presidential candidate Julian Castro on Wednesday evening said the United States needs migrants today more than ever before and will be begging for more migrants in the future if the country does not allow more to stay.

During the 25-minute interview, Mr Maassen also touched upon the problems with integrating a large number of asylum seekers saying, Integration is possible if you create the legal framework and also get people to integrate or be integrated. Integration can not only be ordered, but integration must also be demanded. My concern is that there is integration, but not integration into German society, but into Arab society, the Salafist society or the Turkish society in Germany, so that we have parallel societies. And from my point of view, that has to be prevented with all our might, he added.215 Migrant Crisis France Agrees to Take 20 People Off Ship Barred From Malta216 FRANCE is ready to take in 20 of migrants on a NGO rescue ship of the coast of Malta which has already spent nine days at sea after being refused permission to dock.

Mr Castaners intervention is likely to be an attempt to break the deadlock with Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, who said earlier his country was refusing to allow port access to the ship, saying that the NGO should have headed to Tunisia, the nearest safe port to the rescue spot. Italy has also refused entry. Mr Muscat added We cannot send a signal to other countries that they can do what they want and dump the problem on Malta.217 Stranded Migrant Ship Appeals to Europe for Port After Eight Days at Sea218 A charity ship with scores of African migrants on board appealed to European states for a safe port after being stranded for eight days between Malta and Italy, saying the health of the rescued people was worsening.

The advancement of knowledge regarding etiology, onset, degrees or types of transsexuality was halted. It now costs the career of a social scientist who dares question a monolithic view of transgenderism. LGBTQ dogma authorizes only the narrative of the courageous, marginalized transgender whose only cure is gender transition. But there are so few transsexuals, to get any political traction from this nanominority, homosexual crusaders had to up trans numbers. They did this first by inflicting mass confusion through non-binary gender theory, and then by placing a glamorous, vestal victim transgender upon a shiny new cultural pedestal. The shift from transsexualism to transgenderism constituted a terrible moral degeneracy regarding personal responsibility. Transgenderism means Mikes disordered thinking that he is a woman is not Mikes problem, it is your problem. Big, burly Mike takes some pills, slathers a ton of make-up on his stubbly face, and if you dont honor his womanhood, if you dare to call him sir even by accident, you are a phobic bigot. Mike has a right to teach you a lesson you wont forget, to sue you, to slander you, even to destroy you, all for the LGBTQ cause. Oh, yes and Mike has the right to beat the tar out of your daughter at sports, if you are foolish enough to let her compete against a boy. Lets say the world hadnt gone mad, people didnt require a parade down main street for committing sodomy, and there were no cultural overlords called LGBT needing to weaponize a rare mental disorder. In that world, it might be seen that the loss of natural, true sex identification fits rather well into the category of dissociative mental disorders.229 Lesbians Demanding Wedding Cake Trespassing,  Lawyers Say230 Christian bakery artist Cathy Miller fires back in court Lawyers representing a Christian cake artist in California contend in response to a lawsuit by the state that a same-sex couple demanding that she prepare a cake for their wedding against her will were trespassing. The state now has sued Cathy Miller twice over the claim. A judge ruled in the first case that Millers refusal to make the cake was protected by the First Amendment. The brief by the Freedom of Conscience Defense Fund makes the same argument but also asserts the same-sex couple fraudulently presented themselves as customers to provoke a lawsuit and, therefore, were unlawful trespassers. Millers lawyers contend the couple, Eileen and Mireya Rodriguez-Del Rios, conspired with one another andor aided and abetted one another in bringing what they know is a fraudulent and meritless complaint to collect a money judgment. They participated in a blatant abuse of process in bringing the complaint, with the goal of cashing in financially as well as harming Miller and her Tastries Bakery.231 Mike Pence Pete Buttigieg Knows Better Than to Criticize My Christian Faith232 Vice President Mike Pence on Wednesday broke his silence on repeated attacks from Democrat 2020 presidential contender Pete Buttigieg, telling CNBCs Squawk Box that the South Bend Mayor knows better than to attack his Christian faith.233 Milo Yiannopoulos Launches New Book How to be Poor234 Milo Yiannopoulos has launched a new book, How To be Poor.

As Americas moral foundations literally collapse right in front of our eyes, a large percentage of our pastors are afraid to speak out about controversial topics because they might offend someone. And it doesnt take a genius to figure out why they are so afraid. Most U.S. churches are shrinking, and more than 100 die every week. In a day and age where pastors are judged by attendance numbers and budget levels, scaring people away is bad for business. With all that in mind, the results from a recent Barna survey shouldnt be surprising at all241 Swedish Leftist MP Says We Assume That All Men Are Rapists242 Swedish Left Party MP Linda Snecker asserted that women assume all men are rapists and demanded that all men take collective responsibility during a parliamentary debate.

It was by design it was created by an internationalist intelligentsia to eradicate Western values, social systems, and European racial groups in a pre-emptive attempt to spark global, communist think liberal revolution. Andrew Breitbarts historical notes are taken into the narrative.245 The U.S.s Problem With PC-Culture Lack of Free Speech Will be the Countrys Downfall246 Without free speech returning in full force to college campuses across the United States, the country will see itself perish of politically correct induced culture. One American journalist says that the PC culture will be the entire countrys downfall. Nothing less than the U.S.s survival is at stake, according to American journalist and author Robert Bridge. In 2013, Bridges book, Midnight in the American Empire How Corporations and Their Political Servants Are Destroying the American Dream, was released. The book details how corporations work with the government to kill the American Dream. Now hes saying that the suppression of free speech on college campuses has gone way too far, and unless people are allowed to think and say things freely once again without repercussions, the entire country will perish. As Bridge wrote in an article for RT, America seems to have reached the point in its progressive development where those who seem to have literally lost their minds  much like the authority figures in Ken Keseys masterful 1962 novel, One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest  wish to institutionalize the remainder of the sane population. And Bridge is not far from that truth. Every day we are bombarded by the PC crowd telling us just what we can say and how we are allowed to say it. It is actually pretty difficult to say anything anymore without someone dictating the manner in which it can be said. And it all stems from Americas most insane of all asylums, college campuses.247 Genetic Engineering Homo Sapiens 2.0 is Coming Thanks to the Power of Gene Modification248 HUMANS are rapidly catching up with the natural process of evolution through the incredible powers of genetic engineering, according to a renowned futurist and author who thinks Homo Sapiens 2.0 is coming. The global rise of genetic engineering is unavoidable and people need to look ahead to the future and be aware of the consequences that come with the technology. Equal parts terrifying and awe-inspiring, gene-editing has the potential power to eradicate hereditary diseases, prolong life and create a better and more efficient human species. But genetic tampering also the has the potential to create a significant divide between the rich and the poor, to decide which parts of our human physiology are desirable or beautiful and to ultimately question what it really means to be human. Jamie Metzl, an advisor to the World Health Organization on human genome editing, explores these issues and more in his upcoming book Hacking Darwin Genetic Engineering and the Future of Humanity.249  1 349686  2 349690  3 349678  4 349652  5 349634  6 349604  7 349600  8 349658  9 349738  10 349710  11 349632  12 349664  13 349674  14 349618  15 349684  16 349732  17 349724  18 349616  19 349696  20 349670  21 349610  22 349622  23 349688  24 349734  25 349646  26 349668  27 349660  28 349672  29 349676  30 349680  31 349750  32 349754  33 349666  34 349752  35 349770  36 349766  37 349716  38 349644  39 349656  40 349726  41 349642  42 349758  43 349714  44 349768  45 349640  46 349764  47 349742  48 349746  49 349748  50 349740  51 349638  52 349692  53 349728  54 349730  55 349654  56 349707  57 349703  58 349614  59 349598  60 349648  61 349612  62 349628  63 349636  64 349606  65 349602  66 349694  67 349744  68 349718  69 349762  70 349756  71 349736  72 349720  73 349662  74 349698  75 349626  76 349712  77 349608  78 349630  79 349682  80 349722  81 349650  82 349700  83 349772  84  85 topheadline  86  87 topheadline  88  89 topheadline  90  91 topheadline  92  93 topheadline  94  95 topheadline  96  97 topheadline  98  99 topheadline  100  101 topheadline  102  103 topheadline  104  105 topheadline  106  107 topheadline  108  109 topheadline  110  111 topheadline  112  113 topheadline  114  115 topheadline  116  117 topheadline  118  119 topheadline  120  121 topheadline  122  123 topheadline  124  125 topheadline  126  127 topheadline  128  129 topheadline  130  131 topheadline  132  133 topheadline  134  135 topheadline  136  137 topheadline  138  139 topheadline  140  141 topheadline  142  143 topheadline  144  145 topheadline  146  147 topheadline  148  149 topheadline  150  151 topheadline  152  153 topheadline  154  155 topheadline  156  157 topheadline  158  159 topheadline  160  161 topheadline  162  163 topheadline  164  165 topheadline  166  167 topheadline  168  169 topheadline  170  171 topheadline  172  173 topheadline  174  175 topheadline  176  177 topheadline  178  179 topheadline  180  181 topheadline  182  183 topheadline  184  185 topheadline  186  187 topheadline  188  189 topheadline  190  191 topheadline  192  193 topheadline  194  195 topheadline  196  197 topheadline  198  199 topheadline  200  201 topheadline  202  203 topheadline  204  205 topheadline  206  207 topheadline  208  209 topheadline  210  211 topheadline  212  213 topheadline  214  215 topheadline  216  217 topheadline  218  219 topheadline  220  221 topheadline  222  223 topheadline  224  225 topheadline  226  227 topheadline  228  229 topheadline  230  231 topheadline  232  233 topheadline  234  235 topheadline  236  237 topheadline  238  239 topheadline  240  241 topheadline  242  243 topheadline  244  245 topheadline  246  247 topheadline  248  249 topheadline","homeless, homelessness"

What is the threat, specifically? That it makes the public less willing to go to war with Russia and its allies? That it makes us less trusting of lying, torturing, coup-staging intelligence agencies? Does accidentally catching a glimpse of that green RT logo turn you to stone like Medusa, or melt your face like in Raiders of the Lost Ark? Well, it makes us lose trust in our institutions, is the most common reply. Okay. So? Wheres the threat there? We know for a fact that weve been lied to by those institutions. Iraq isnt just something we imagined. We should be skeptical of claims made by western governments, intelligence agencies and mass media. How specifically is that skepticism dangerous? Braw argues that, because Russian propaganda is so dangerous what with the threat of British people having insufficient emotional exuberance during a possible naval battle and all, what is required is a NATO of infowar, an alliance of western state media that is tasked with combatting Russian counter-narratives. Because, in the strange Dungeons ...agons fantasy fairy world in which Braw penned her article, this isnt already happening. And of course, here in the real world, it is already happening. As I wrote recently, mainstream media outlets have been going out of their minds churning out attack editorials on anyone who questions the establishment narrative about what happened in Douma. A BBC reporter recently admonished a retired British naval officer for voicing skepticism of what were being told about Syria on the grounds that it might muddy the waters of the information war that is being fought against Russia. All day, every day, western mass media are pummeling the public with stories about how awful and scary Russians are and how everything they say is a lie. This is because western mass media outlets are owned by western plutocrats, and those plutocrats have built their empires upon a status quo that they have a vested interest in preserving, often to the point where they will form alliances with defense and intelligence agencies to do so. They hire executives and editors who subscribe to a pro-establishment worldview, who in turn hire journalists who subscribe to a pro-establishment worldview, and in that way they ensure that all plutocrat-owned media outlets are advancing pro-plutocrat agendas.54 Donald Trump, Best in the West55 Opposed by Democrats, the media and a nefarious cabal of high government officials, this most unlikely president has implemented precisely what he promised on the stump. Despite the Deep States worst efforts to bring him down, his record far exceeds even that of the great Ronald Reagan Australia is fortunate indeed that Donald Trump is US President, just as we have been fortunate that we have always been so close to the worlds most powerful nation  first Great Britain, then the United States of America. It is crucial to Australia that the US continue in her powerful role of preserving, protecting and defending Western civilisation based, as it is, on Judeo-Christian values.56 How Deep is the Deep State, Part 357 We have to look at these organizations in order to understand who is attempting to direct America towards the one world order. They are everywhere and have infiltrated every concept of American life. One that was co-founded by a member of the Lyndon Johnson and Jimmie Carter administrations, Zbignew Brzezinski, is the Trilateral Commission. The Trilateral Commission was established in 1973. Its founder and primary financial angel was international financier, David Rockefeller, longtime chairman of the Rockefeller family-controlled Chase Manhattan Bank and undisputed overlord of his familys global corporate empire. Rockefellers idea for establishing the commission emerged after he had read a book entitled Between Two Ages written by an Establishment scholar, Prof. Zbigniew Brzezinski of Columbia University. In his book Brzezinski proposed a vast alliance between North America, Western Europe and Japan. According to Brzezinski, changes in the modern world required it. Resist as it might, Brzezinski wrote elsewhere, the American system is compelled gradually to accommodate itself to this emerging international context, with the U.S. government called upon to negotiate, to guarantee, and, to some extent, to protect the various arrangements that have been contrived even by private business. In other words, it was necessary for the international upper class to band together to protect its interests, and to ensure, in the developed nations, that political leaders were brought to power who would ensure that the global financial interests of the Rockefellers and the other ruling elites would be protected over those of the hoi polloi To put it simply, Trilateralists are saying The people, governments and economies of all nations must serve the needs of multinational banks and corporations. In short, Trilateralism is the current attempt by ruling elites to manage both dependence and democracy  at home and abroad. Another Trilateral critic, now-retired Sen. Barry Goldwater R-Ariz., views the commission as a Rockefeller family operation through and through. According to Goldwater The Trilateral organization created by David Rockefeller was a surrogate  the members selected by Rockefeller, its purposes defined by Rockefeller, its funding supplied by Rockefeller. David Rockefeller screened and selected every individual who was invited to participate. 5 Members in this group are just as elite as in the others and youll see that many are members in some of the other groups as well. Youll also find many members of the military in this group as well Madeleine K. Albright, Adm. Dennis B. Blair ret., Michael Bloomberg, Michael Chertoff, and Paul A. Volcker are just a few.58 Nine Stabbed in Unprovoked Spree at Idaho Apartment Complex59 BOISE  Nine people are hospitalized  some seriously  after a man went on a stabbing spree at an apartment complex in Boise, Idaho, that is home to many refugee families, police said. A 30-year-old man from out of state has been arrested in connection with the attack Saturday night that police said seemed to be unprovoked. This incident is not a representation of our community but a single evil individual who attacked people without provocation that we are aware of at this time, Boise Police Chief Bill Bones said Saturday evening. Our community is reeling from this attack. Police said they do not know if the suspect is connected to the victims in any way. Boise police got a call at 846 p.m. local time about a man with a knife attacking victims at the apartment complex. The suspect was located and taken into custody immediately, police said. The officers found the stabbing victims in the apartment complex and its parking lot, according to police. Nine were taken to a local hospital. The suspect is in custody and being interviewed at this time, the Boise Police Department said on its Twitter feed. Victim witness coordinators and counselors are working with the victims and witnesses to provide them services in the days and weeks ahead.60 Police Identify Man Arrested for Boise Stabbing That Injured Nine61 BOISE, Idaho KBOI  Boise police have identified the man arrested for a stabbing that injured nine people Saturday night, including six children. Police say Timmy Kinner, 30, of Los Angeles, was arrested and charged with nine counts of felony aggravated battery and six counts of felony injury to a child. Officers say 4 of the nine people have life-threatening injuries. Some of the victims are members of the refugee community. Police say Kinner is not a refugee. Investigators say the preliminary evidence is showing that Kinner was a temporary resident at an apartment complex at State Street and Wylie Lane, where the stabbings happened. Police say he was asked to leave the apartments Friday.  According to Utah court records, Kinner was arrested in St. George, Utah, in April for stealing a mans wallet. He was given 18 months probation as punishment. See more at URL. EDITORIAL COMMENT the perp is from L.A., probably mentally disturbed. Definitely homeless. Perhaps someone in L.A. gave him a bus ticket62 Revisiting the Violent Left of the 60s for Perspective on the Left Today63 In the 1970s, Larry Grathwohl went undercover for the FBI in the Weather Underground terrorist group. In this 2013 interview with WNDBs Marc Bernier, Grathwohl talks about his experiences with Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn as they planned and executed terrorist bombings in the United States and their ties to Barack and Michele Obama. What about the anti-American left of today? Brandon Darby was involved with the violent anti-American left in movements like Occupy Wall Street. In the video below, he explains why he decided to become an FBI informant initially to help stop a terrorist plot directed at the Republican National Convention in 2008.64 Riot Breaks Out in Portland as Antifa Activists Clash With Conservative Marchers65 Members of Antifa clashed with members of the conservative group Patriot Prayer Saturday evening in Portland, Ore., forcing police to declare that a riot was taking place as officers fired paintballs filled with tear gas into the crowd, according to the Oregonian. Scuffles broke out shortly after 6 pm local time as Antifa protesters pelted marchers from the conservative group with eggs, water bottles and firecrackers as the marchers spilled out into downtown Portland for their legally permitted march in support of a conservative Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate. The march followed an afternoon rally at Terry Schrunk Federal Plaza, Reuters reported.66 Viral Walk Away Videos Highlight Growing Movement of Democrats Leaving the Party67  They gather at his two Facebook groups, The Unsilent Minority and WalkAway Campaign. Those who have the courage post their own video testimonials about the moment when the abuse, rage, and ugliness of the Democrats caused them to finally leave the party and walk away. This is so much more than a hashtag on Twitter, he said. This is a testimonial campaign, a grassroots movement that is going to change the political landscape of this country. And thats the astonishing twist here If these people have been driven into the arms of Donald Trump, whos left on the left? See also Williams Why Liberals Have Flip-Flopped on Free Speech69 In a remarkably honest expos, the New York Times acknowledged Saturday that liberals who once championed expansive First Amendment rights are now uneasy about them ever since conservatives realized they should apply to them as well. The Times cites First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams who noted that whereas the left once led support for First Amendment protections, they are now at least skeptical and sometimes distraught at the level of First Amendment protection which is being afforded in cases brought by litigants on the right. Catharine A. MacKinnon, a law professor at the University of Michigan, goes further still, declaring that free speech reinforces and amplifies injustice because it is now being used to defend ideas she finds distressing. Once a defense of the powerless, the First Amendment over the last hundred years has mainly become a weapon of the powerful, writes MacKinnon, who teaches such courses as Evolution of Gender Crimes and Sex Equality. Whereas free speech used to be invoked to defend radicals, artists and activists, socialists and pacifists, the excluded and the dispossessed, MacKinnon laments, it has now become a sword for authoritarians, racists and misogynists, Nazis and Klansmen, pornographers and corporations buying elections. In reading through the New York Times piece it becomes abundantly clear that many liberals really never cared about free speech as such, but rather sought protection specifically for progressive ideas and behaviors. As soon as conservatives started demanding the same protections for their speech, it no longer seemed like such a good idea.70 Teahouse Attacked on Yelp After Kicking Out Customer in MAGA Hat71 Vancouvers Teahouse in Stanley Park has been flooded with a wave of one-star Yelp reviews following a recent incident that saw a manager fired for refusing service to a man in a Make America Great Again hat. Darin Hodge was dismissed from the restaurant Thursday, two days after asking a customer to remove the red MAGA hat, which signals support not just for Donald Trump, but for his divisive and often racist policies. The Sequoia Company of Restaurants, which owns the Teahouse, said in an emailed statement that it does not support intolerance of any kind and cannot discriminate against someone based on their support for the current administration in the United States or any other bona fide political party. But Hodge was defiant, releasing a statement Friday through Facebook standing by his decision. The MAGA hat has come to symbolize racism, bigotry, Islamophobia, misogyny, white supremacy, homophobia, Hodge said. As a person with a strong moral backbone, I had to take a stand against this guests choice of headgear while in my former place of work. Absolutely no regrets. News of the incident kicked off a tempest for the Teahouse. Hodges name was trending on Twitter in Vancouver Friday afternoon, as many took to social media to voice their support for his actions and their anger with the Teahouses response, which they believed aligned the popular brunch spot with racism and hatespeech, rather than in opposition to it7273 France Investigates Muslim Cleric for Allegedly Inciting Hatred Against Jews74 French prosecutors announced Friday that they are investigating an imam for allegedly inciting hatred against Jews and violence against Israel in a video-recorded sermon. Prosecutors said they will investigate Mohamed Tatai, imam at the Grand Mosque of Toulouse, for comments he made in a December 15 sermon in which he predicted the destruction of Israel and cited a Hadith about Muslims killing Jews in the last days, according to The Times of Israel. Video of the sermon, translated by the Middles East Media Research Institute MEMRI, garnered condemnation against Tatai from Bnai Brith, the oldest Jewish advocacy and service organization in the world75 French Ambassador Praises Hungarian Prime Minister, Brands Muslims in France and Germany Anti-Semitic76 A leaked confidential note from the French ambassador to Hungary has revealed praise for Prime Minister Viktor Orbans migrant policy, and has drawn ire from French president Emmanuel Macron. In the confidential note, which was addressed to the lyse Palace and top European Union officials, Ambassador Eric Fournier defends the Hungarian leader, saying that the migrant policy of Prime Minister Orban is a model for Europe and that many politicians in the west suffer from Hungaryophobia, French broadcaster BFMTV reports.77 Germanys AfD Calls for a Fortress Europe at Party Conference78 Representatives of Germanys right-wing populist AfD have urged the creation of Fortress Europe with the help of Hungarys Viktor Orban and Austrias Sebastian Kurz. Thousands protested AfD party congress in Augsburg. Some 600 AfD representatives gathered in Augsburg for the start of a two-day congress of the German populist party on Saturday, as left-wing protesters staged demonstrations in the Bavarian city. Addressing the delegates, senior AfD lawmaker Jörg Meuthen slammed multiculturalism as a quixotic ideology and the great ideological fallacy of the early 21st century. Meuthen also pushed for a new immigration policy that would turn the EU into Fortress Europe.79 Is Guilt Killing the West From Within?80 A sense of guilt for colonialism is debasing the West from within, according to Professor Bruce Gilley, and authoritarian regimes such as Iran, Russia, China and Turkey are profiting from this weakness. The Romans called it damnatio memoriae the damnation of memory that resulted in destroying the portraits and even the names of the fallen emperors. The same process is now underway in the West about its colonial past. The cultural elite in the West now seem so haunted by feelings of imperialist guilt that they are no longer confident that our civilization is something to be proud of. A sense of guilt now seems a kind of post-Christian substitute religion that seduces many Westerners. The French scholar Shmuel Trigano suggested that this ideology is turning the Westerners into post-colonial subjects who no longer believe in their own civilization, but instead what will destroy it multiculturalism. In France, for example, a manifesto was launched for a multicultural and post racial republic. The result would be, in the words of the anthropologist Jean-Loup Amselle, a war of identities and a clash between communities. Last month, the UK Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said that, if elected Prime Minister, he would order the British Museum to return to Greece the Elgin Marbles, the frieze that had surrounded the Parthenon of Athens and one of the major attractions of the British Museum. This whole campaign is sheer lunacy, wrote Richard Dorment. But it is a lunacy spreading all over Europe. Thirty years ago, in a book, The Tears of the White Man, the French philosopher Pascal Bruckner wrote that, the remorseless and self-righteous critic who endlessly denounces the deceptions of parliamentary democracy is suddenly rapt with admiration before the atrocities committed in the name of the Koran, the Vedas, the Great Helmsman Since then, Western elites have excused many crimes committed in the name of political Islam, as if these were the consequences of our own colonial crimes.81 Italy 4 Nuns Suspended for Mistreating Nursery School Kids82 Near Caserta ANSA  Caserta, June 28  Four nuns including two Filipinas, an Indonesian and an Italian mother superior were suspended Thursday for allegedly mistreating nursery school children near Caserta north of Naples. They were suspended for a year for mistreating the children, aged three to five. The mother superior did not personally take part in the maltreatment but did nothing to prevent it, police said.83 Italys Salvini Vows to Create Pan-European Association of Nationalist Parties84 Having taken Italy by storm, and threatening to prematurely terminate the career of German Chancellor Angela Merkel with his staunch opposition to further European migration, Matteo Salvini  leader of Italys populist League  said on Sunday he wanted to expand its success to create a pan-European association of like-minded, nationalist parties.85 Meet the Germans Why Germanys Nudist Culture Remains Refreshing86 From lakes to saunas and parks Is Germanys nudist culture, known as FKK, dying out or still making waves? Its still strong enough to inspire a change of attitude for Berlin-based expats. At first glance it seems like a regular beach scene Children running in and out the water, sandwiches being passed around families and couples sunning themselves. But on closer inspection most people at Krumme Lanke, a lake in the south west of Berlin have something in common. They arent wearing a scrap of clothing. And its a non-event. No one cares and no one is surprised. Theres nothing sexy about it. Its 25C its a very hot spring day and theres really no need for clothing if you dont feel like wearing it87 Merkels Friends and Foes in the EU88 German Chancellor Angela Merkel needs allies among EU leaders in her search for a European solution to the migration crisis. But they are getting thin on the ground, and some have even come out against her. At the European level, German chancellor Angela Merkel has been the undisputed number one head of state and government for some time. But since the beginning of the migration crisis, she is looking increasingly lonely. Especially now, given the domestic political pressures she faces, Merkel is more dependent on supporters in Brussels. So, what can she expect from other leaders as they meet in Brussels? The Partner If anyone can be called Merkels politicial friend, it is French President Emmanuel Macron. Like Merkel, he is an advocate of a European solution to the migration problem. He, like her, sees the issue as axiomatic to the EUs future existence. However, some in Germany believe Macrons support comes at a high price. The sympathetic one New Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, may have acted in the spirit of Merkel when he took in boats with African refugees, after the Italian government had turned them away. Such humanity is rare at the moment, but the socialist has also said that his country needs assistance in coping with migration. The Mediator The trading nation of the Netherlands is very interested in keeping the EUs internal borders open. On that issue, its prime minister, Mark Rutte, agrees with Merkel. On the other hand, the mood in the country is now more hostile to migrants. Rutters fence-sitting strategy means he could take a mediating role89 Notorious French Gangster Flees Paris Jail in Dramatic Helicopter Escape90 A notorious gangster who was once Frances most wanted, has pulled off an epic jailbreak, escaping from prison by helicopter, according to the Telegraph. Rdoine Fad, 46, was flown out of the Rau prison located in Paris south-eastern suburbs on Sunday, aided by two heavily armed men, local police said. A Belgium-registered helicopter landed in the courtyard of the prison, believed to be the only spot not protected by a net, sources told Reuters.91 Polands Ruling Conservatives Gain in New Poll92 If parliamentary elections were held this Sunday, Polands ruling conservative Law and Justice PiS party would win 42.3 percent of the vote, according to a poll.93 Red Terror Alt-Left Antifa Extremists Brag About Vicious Attack on British Identitarian Leader94 Alt-left Antifa extremists have taken responsibility for a vicious attack on Generation Identity UK co-leader Tom Dupr, severely lacerating his face and allegedly leaving him unconscious for up to five minutes. The politically motivated attack took place on Thursday evening in the Hackney area of London, according to Dupr, who said he had been in a pub in the area, then left and walked by a Kurdish community centre noticing a group of Antifa extremists.95 Remembering Food Rationing Under Communism96 My elder aunt uses words of love to describe the menu for today. She is a gourmet cook who likes to eat and uses all the fattening ingredients she can possibly find in her pantry in order to make everything tastier, sweeter, and more buttery. Unable to walk from the pounds she put on after the fall of communism in 1989, she cannot stop buying food. Most of her pension is spent on food, medicine, and rent. The survival mode that was etched into her brain during 45 years of communist rule is impossible to erase. People hoarded food every day because they never knew when a more severe rationing or complete scarcity would commence, and food would be hard or impossible to find. Unless they had a severe hormonal illness, Romanians were very thin and even gaunt under communism. Westerners joked that women were beautiful because they were on Ceausescus diet. The dear leader even passed a decree telling citizens exactly how much food and calories they could consume per day and how much they should weigh. Perhaps it would be hard for American women to see that as a bad thing, considering they are obsessed with weight loss. Most Americans today dont understand what its like to starve or wait in line for food and return home empty-handed with a growling stomach after smelling fresh-baked bread. The younger generations are too far removed from the Great Depression and the soup kitchens of Herbert Hoovers administration 19291933. Ive always cautioned my Che Guevara T-shirt-wearing students who express their love for communism Be careful what you wish for, because reality may be quite different from the romanticized version your clueless teachers describe, when they themselves have never lived a day under the boot of communism.97 Trump Pressing for a Super-Fast Trade Deal in Secret Talks About Britain After the EU98 DONALD Trump has pressed for a super-fast trade deal with Britain in secret talks between one of his key advisers and Tory Brexiteers. National security adviser John Bolton has met the powerful European Research Group, headed by Jacob Rees-Mogg, to discuss Britains post-Brexit relationship with the US. Comment This is a great move by Trump. A US-UK trade deal will help the UKs position vis a vis the EU, hastening the EUs demise. 99 UK London 11-Year-Old Boy Arrested After Boy, 14, Was Knifed Multiple Times in the Street100 An 11-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a teenager was stabbed several times in the middle of a north London street. A boy, 14, was found with multiple blade wounds and has been taken by air ambulance to an east London hospital. Officers were called to Fairbridge Road, Islington, at 6.50pm to reports of an injured male.101 UK Moped Muggers Are Inflicting Misery to Fund Party Lifestyle102 MOPED muggers are using the proceeds of their crimes to fund exotic summer holidays, a security expert said yesterday. They have been selling snatched watches, mobile phones and jewellery to pay for trips to party islands in the Mediterranean.103 UK Smirking After Gang Raping a Teenage Girl Sickening Trio Laugh Off Brutal Park Attack on Helpless 19-Year-Old Student They Lured From a Night Club and Dumped in a Street  as Judge Jails Them for 27 Years104 Three callous men have been jailed after they led a teenage university student to a car park so they could gang rape her and dump her in the street. Sali Amet, 23, Omer Engin, 24, and Salih Altun, 25, were caught on CCTV luring their victim, 19, from The Cuban Bar in Canterbury, Kent on April 13 this year. They were seen taking her to a nearby car park where she was raped four times by the three men in a horrific 50-minute attack.105 UK Urgent Tommy Robinson Update UKs Senior Criminal Judge to Hear Tommys Appeal106 I have just received breaking news from Tommy Robinsons family, and I wanted to pass it on to you immediately. The Right Honourable Lord Justice Leveson, the most senior criminal judge in the United Kingdom, will hear Tommy Robinsons appeal at the Royal Courts of Justice, in London, on July 10 at 10am.107 Opinion Macedonia, Albania Accession Talks  the EU Never Fails to Disappoint108 France and the Netherlands have sacrificed the EUs credibility in the Balkans, punishing Macedonia and Albania in order to appease populists. Its a dangerous and short-sighted move, says DWs Boris Georgievski. An EU candidate country since 2005, and recommended for accession negotiations nine times, Macedonia has never been spared humiliation and disappointment in its relations with the European Union. For almost a decade Greece blocked the Balkan country over the name dispute. Now that the disputeis nearing an end, the future North Macedonia rightfully hoped to receive its just reward. But the EU managed to disappoint the country once again. Instead of recommending a date to start the accession negotiations as promised, the EU has announced it will set out a path towards opening accession negotiations in June 2019. The same fate befell Albania, Macedonias western Balkan neighbor. Victims of EU politics Both Macedonia and Albania are victims of internal EU disagreements France and the Netherlands wanted to postpone the European Commissions plan for negotiations mainly because of their own internal political considerations. And although French President Emmanuel Macron for his part has argued that the EU shouldnt accept more members before carrying out its own internal reforms, EU officials have indicated Macron is actually afraid that French populists and right-wing movements would use accession to drum up fears of migration from eastern Europe. The governments in Skopje and Tirana, as well as the European Commission tried to put a positive spin on the decision, praising it as historical, but it would take an enormous effort to find much to celebrate109 Population Alarming Decline in Balkans and Eastern Europe110 Phenomenon particularly significant in the Balkans ANSA  BELGRADE, 29 GIU  Many countries in Eastern and South-eastern Europe are witnessing a worrying phenomenon of reduction of their population, at an alarming rate, while the population in Western Europe is at the same time increasing, according to the report European Demographic Data Sheet 2018, made recently public by the Vienna Institute for Demography of the Austrian Academy of Sciences and the Wittgenstein Centre. Europe today remains divided by long-term population trends and this division mostly follows the past geopolitical cleavage between Europes East and West, the report states. The West, South, and North of Europe, in particular the richest regions and Ireland, Switzerland, Norway and Spain,, are witnessing a rising population sizes, to be explained as combination of minor natural population increases and higher levels of immigration than emigration. At the same time, almost all countries in Central, South-Eastern, and Eastern Europe saw substantial population declines, due to a combined effect of natural population decrease and emigration. According to data quoted in the report, the Balkans are one of the region most affected by a negative population change, with a rate unprecedented in times of peace, the study noted. In Bosnia, the population declined by 22 between 1990 and 2017, in Bulgaria by 19, in Romania by 15, in Croatia -13, in Serbia -8. A significant drop of population was registered also in Moldova -19, in Latvia -27 and Lithuania -23, less significant in Hungary -6, while the Czech Republic 2, Slovakia and Slovenia 3 registered a slight increase in their population in the past decades.111 World View Syria and Russia Create Humanitarian Catastrophe in Daraa112 The assault that began on June 19 of the combination of the army of Syrias president Bashar al-Assad and bombs from Russian warplanes is threatening a massive humanitarian disaster greater than the combined sizes of the humanitarian disasters at Aleppo and Ghouta. Daraa is supposed to be part of a de-escalation zone, based on peace talks last year in Astana, Kazakhstan, between Russia, Iran, and Turkey. An outcome was that Russia and the U.S. agreed that the U.S. would oversee the ceasefire in Daraa. Promises and agreements mean nothing to Russia and Syria, and they never intended to honor the ceasefire. The U.S. does usually honor its promises, but in this case has chosen not to intervene, rather than get pulled into yet another war, this time a full-scale war with Syria and Russia.113 Malaysian Man Marries 11 Yr Old Thai Girl114 KUALA LUMPUR The marriage of a Malaysia man with a 11-year-old Thai girl in the Muslim majority country has sparked outrage with one activist yesterday labeling the groom a child predator. Malaysian Muslims below the age of 16 are allowed to marry if they obtain the permission of a religious court. But the countrys women and families ministry said there was no record of religious authorities approving the union, which took place last month across the border in Thailands largely Muslim far south. Our officers have gone to the house and met the girls mother. We are waiting for more reports before deciding on the next course of action, deputy prime minister Wan Azizah Wan Ismail was quoted as saying by the Sunday Star newspaper. The 41-year-old husband could be jailed for six months if he married without permission.- AFP115 Christians Slaughtered. Yawn.116 Andrew Bolt, Herald Sun They are Africans and mostly Christians, so of little interest to the media Over 200 people, most of them believed to be Christians, were massacred over three days in Nigeria this past weekend, officials and church sources are saying, as the relentless bloodshed carried out by radicals continues. The Christian Association of Nigeria said on Wednesday that the current death toll in the countrys Middle Belt, based on attacks that began last Thursday and continued until Sunday, stands at 218. The killings are a result of clashes between the radical Muslim Fulani herdsmen and local area farmers near the city of Jos, many of whom are Christians, though officials have not yet identified how many of the victims belong to each group. Organizations representing the Fulani have denied that they are responsible for the attacks, AFP reported, though police say that the cattle-herders are indeed to blame. Plateau State Governor Simon Lalong revealed that sophisticated weapons were used in the latest attacks on farmlands, which he said were reflective of a terrorist invasion.117 Breaking Andrs Manuel López Obrador Wins Mexico Election According to Exit Poll118 MEXICOs Lopez Obrador is likely to have won the Mexico presidential election by between 53 and 59 percent according to the Parametria exit poll.119 German Interior Minister Offers to Resign in Migration Showdown With Merkel120 Germanys interior minister Horst Seehofer on Sunday said he wants to resign both his office and his position as head of the hardline conservative Bavarian CSU party, throwing into question the future of Chancellor Angela Merkels coalition government. Seehofer and his party spent hours finding a response to a hard-fought agreement to reduce migration into the European Union and so-called secondary migration between member states hammered out by Merkel at a leaders summit last week.121 German Interior Minister Unhappy With Merkels EU Migration Deal122 German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer is unhappy with Chancellor Angela Merkels deal with other EU nations to slash immigration, sources from his CSU party told AFP Sunday, a sign she may have failed to defuse tensions within her conservative alliance.123 Germanys Interior Minister Seehofer to Resign After Clash With Merkel Over Migrants124 Update 2 No statement from Merkel tonight contrary to earlier reports however Seehofer did speak to reporters and said that he offered to quit as German interior minister, and that he wants to avoid Merkel government collapse. He also added that he will stay in politics if Angela Merkels CDU backs down in the two parties deadlock over migration, DPA reports.125 Germany Merkel Coalition Govt on Brink as Interior Minister Threatens to Resign Over Immigration126 BERLIN AP  Germanys interior minister and head of the Christian Social Union party reportedly offered his resignation from both posts Sunday night rather than back down from his stance against Chancellor Angela Merkels migration policies, as the crisis within her governing coalition came to a head. The dpa news agency, citing information from unidentified participants, reported that a nearly eight-hour meeting of the CSU in Munich was put on hold after Interior Minister Horst Seehofer made his offer. Dpa reported that Alexander Dobrindt, the leader of the CSU in parliament, told others Seehofer could not be allowed to resign. If Seehofer does step down, it was not immediately clear what effect the move would have on a three-week impasse between Merkel and her Bavarian-only CSU partners, which has centered around his resolve to turn away some types of asylum-seekers at Germanys borders.127 Illegal Immigrant Arrested for Starting a Colorado Fire That Charred 40K Acres128 Colorado authorities arrested an illegal immigrant Saturday for allegedly starting a string of wildfires in the state that have consumed more than 40,000 acres and has not yet been contained. Jesper Joergensen was apprehended after the announcement was made at a community meeting, the Costilla County Sheriffs Office confirmed.

His tweet comes 24 hours after the bodies of three babies were washed up on a Libyan shore when a boat carrying 120 immigrants sank with just 16 survivors. Comment Well, the deaths are due to the risky actions of the NGOs and adult migrants.133 Large Increase in Number of German Women Feeling Unsafe Name Refugees as Essential Factor134 Women in Germanys Sinsheim municipality feel increasingly unsafe, an academic study says. Compared with nine years ago, two and a half times more women say they feel less secure, the Rhein Neckar Zeitung reports. The results were presented to the local council by research leader Prof. Dieter Hermann of the University of Heidelberg.135 Merkel and Her Coalition in Crisis German Interior Minister to Resign Over Migration Row136 Party sources told news agency AFPGermanys interior Minister Horst Seehofer has offered to step down after a day of talks with the German Chancellor over a European Union agreement on limiting immigration.137 New EU Deal Continues Migrant Influx, Advances Globalism138 With the European Union superstate on the brink of collapse over disagreements on how to handle the migrant tsunami swamping the bloc, EU leaders met in Brussels last week and inked a compromise deal that will encourage further mass migration while advancing globalism in Europe and beyond. Globalist EU bigwigs and United Nations bosses all celebrated the plan. Even some ostensibly populist leaders expressed support due to some minor concessions they secured. But as Western governments continue to promote mass immigration from the Third World, the latest polls show Europeans, like Americans, are overwhelmingly opposed  and public outrage is reaching a boiling point. Meanwhile, warnings that tens of millions of migrants are waiting to pour in are growing louder.139 South Koreans Resist Arrival of Yemeni Asylum Seekers140 There has been a backlash after a thousand Yemenis exploited a visa loophole to apply for refugee status. Many South Koreans are concerned that Muslims will fail to integrate into their society. An influx of nearly 1,000 Yemeni asylum seekers into the South Korean resort island of Jeju has triggered a fierce backlash against immigration rules that many South Koreans perceive to be lax and dangerous to the well-being of their society. The concern has grown suddenly with 950 foreign nationals  the majority fleeing conflict-wracked Yemen  applying at the Jeju Immigration Office for legal refugee status after arriving as tourists. In the whole of last year, only 312 people applied for refugee status on Jeju and local people fear their island is being targeted as an easy way into the East Asian nation141 Spain to Take in NGO With 59 Migrants After Italy and Malta Refuse Access142 UPDATED A Spanish NGO said on Saturday it had rescued 59 migrants as they tried to cross the Mediterranean from Libya and would dock in Spain after Italy and Malta refused access.143 Study 83 of Rapes in Denmark Are Committed by Migrants or Their Descendants144 A recent study, by newspaper BT, reveals that 10 in 12 rapes committed in Denmark are by migrants, or their descendants. The review was based on sentencing reports between January 2016 and May 2017 and the figures have increased. The perpetrators were from Macedonia, Somalia, Bulgaria, Iraq and Eritrea. It is commonly know that Africa has a higher rate of sexual assaults than other areas of the world. These were also rapes where the victim did not know the attacker, which in Europe was more rare.145 Switzerland Refuses to Take More Asylum Seekers From Italy, Greece146 Switzerland has rejected a refugee relocation program proposed by the European Union to relieve the burden on frontier countries like Italy and Greece, local media reported on Sunday. The Sonntags Blick paper reported that a spokesperson from the Swiss State Secretariat for Migration SEM has confirmed that the country will not renew its commitment to accept asylum seekers from southern European countries.147 Three Pakistani Migrants Attempt to Rape British Tourist in Zakinthos, Greece148 A British woman holidaying in Zakinthos, reported to police in Kalamaki, that three Pakistani migrants tried to rape her yesterday near the Area of Laganas. The young British woman, after an enjoying night at a club near Laganas, became lost on her way to her hotel so she asked a stranger for directions. Instead of leading her to her hotel, the Pakistani man lead her to a local barn, where he was living with fellow countrymen. He obviously had already informed them by phone, as they were waiting for the lady totally naked.149 Bill Gates, UNESCO, Common Core and Failing Government Schools150 We have been reporting the failure of Americas government schools who now follow UNESCOs worldwide Common Core. You read that right Common Core is a UNESCO program, and is supported by Microsoft. As a result, American government schools are failing our students. Fifty percent of American graduates cannot read, write and do simple math. Bill Gates admitted its failure. More money is his answer. We all know that the only thing that will affect change is a return of the curricula back to traditional education, WHICH WAS A HUGE SUCCESS Common Core forces a child to think in a box with little hope for a future not in line with the predetermined government goal. Common Core is based on the premise that people are stupid and the smart academics know best. To rise against their desired response often causes a child to be bullied or act out just to make their ideas known. Drugs, massive piercing, drinking, murder, terrorism, suicide are often the result of feeling hopeless. Common Core manipulates emotion and eliminates individualism, forcing a child into groupthink, not innovation and creation. Emotion become dominant with no logic reason balance. A person can only think of one thought at a time. By forcing overuse of right brain function emotion the left brain logic and reason become dormant from lack of use. Today, aside from being functionally illiterate, too many people are motivated by a trigger that unleashes unbridled emotion too often resulting in violence or suicide. Continuing to do the same thing over and over, expecting different results, is insane, as we have heard over and over. Common Core, Whole Word Reading, Eureka Math, Evolution all assist in diminishing the capacity of Americas future. Yet we ignore the facts and continue to push this horrid programs filled with errors, omissions and bias. Have we learned nothing from years of failing grades? Why are we forcing Americas children to follow a failed program? Education based on collectivism not individualism, training not education and values not facts, according to the brilliant educator Shirley McCune, is to change and alter the society. This is not education. It is indoctrination. She promotes outcome based education. Our childrens destiny will now be chosen by a computer. How many more generations of Americans will we lose to this indoctrination called education?

Let that sink in.153 Of Their Father the Devil154 A few weeks ago, several of us from Wisconsin joined the Salt and Light Brigade team at a series of street-witnessing events in Columbus, Ohio. Remnant Christians came to serve from 21 states, all across the nation. In all, there were about a hundred of us taking part this year. Our mission was to minister the TRUE Gospel, warn the wicked and rescue the perishing at several venues. First up was street preaching at a local mosque. We did not go to be mean, hateful, or to pick a fight with Muslims  we went to give them the Good News of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Our plan was to witness to Muslims as they entered their mosque for their Friday call to prayer. But to our surprise, upon our arrival, we discovered there WERE NO Muslims  their call to prayer had been cancelled. And while the mosque was situated in a Muslim neighborhood, none came out of their homes or apartments. What DID we encounter? The entrance to the mosque was being guarded by about 500 self-professing Christians, and Pastors, standing arm-in-arm with pagans, witches, and homosexuals. YOU HEARD ME RIGHT. Their message was Love Over Hate. Of course, WE were deemed the haters, as we came with the truth  right out of Gods Word. Somehow, they had heard we were coming, and they arrived ahead of us, and these so-called Christians chanted and shouted PROFANITY at us, as they stood in solidarity with the false god of Islam, Wiccans, Pagans, Witches and sodomites. YES, AGAIN, YOU HEARD ME RIGHT.155  1  2 318981  3 318992  4 318975  5 318963  6 318984  7 319033  8 319003  9 318994  10 318988  11 318986  12 319015  13 319045  14 318971  15 318998  16 318967  17 319007  18 318970  19 318973  20 319005  21 319053  22 319047  23 318996  24 319039  25 319025  26 319037  27 319035  28 319031  29 318969  30 318968  31 318990  32 318983  33 318985  34 319041  35 319019  36 319017  37 319001  38 319043  39 319013  40 319056  41 319049  42 319023  43 319027  44 319011  45 318972  46 318965  47 319021  48 319051  49 319029  50 318979  51 319009  52 318977  53  54 topheadline  55  56 topheadline  57  58 topheadline  59  60 topheadline  61  62 topheadline  63  64 topheadline  65  66 topheadline  67  68 topheadline  69  70 topheadline  71  72  73 topheadline  74  75 topheadline  76  77 topheadline  78  79 topheadline  80  81 topheadline  82  83 topheadline  84  85 topheadline  86  87 topheadline  88  89 topheadline  90  91 topheadline  92  93 topheadline  94  95 topheadline  96  97 topheadline  98  99 topheadline  100  101 topheadline  102  103 topheadline  104  105 topheadline  106  107 topheadline  108  109 topheadline  110  111 topheadline  112  113 topheadline  114  115 topheadline  116  117 topheadline  118  119 topheadline  120  121 topheadline  122  123 topheadline  124  125 topheadline  126  127 topheadline  128  129 topheadline  130  131 topheadline  132  133 topheadline  134  135 topheadline  136  137 topheadline  138  139 topheadline  140  141 topheadline  142  143 topheadline  144  145 topheadline  146  147 topheadline  148  149 topheadline  150  151 topheadline  152  153 topheadline  154  155 topheadline","homeless, soup kitchen"

This is slightly better than the 4.9 percent prediction in June. Germanys economy will contract six percent, Spain 12.8 percent and Italy 10.6 percent. Chinas economy will grow by 1.9 percent. However, for 2021, the IMF expects eurozone growth of 5.4 percent.110 Soaring Food Costs Send Producer Prices Higher in September111 While Energy costs are lower -0.3 MoM 11.4 YoY, Food costs are the biggest incremental driver of the hotter than expected inflationary print, rising 1.2 MoM 13.3 YoY.112 Swedish Democrats Want to Give Over 1100 to All Citizens113 The Swedish Democrat party wants to give all citizens in Sweden over 1100, while children will get over 550.

As we highlighted earlier, Facebook announced that it would be preventing the story from spreading on its site after the companys Policy Communications Manager and lifelong Democrat Party operative Andy Stone said the company had buried the article in its algorithm.116 Facts Do Not Matter to the Covidian Cult117 One of the hallmarks of totalitarianism is mass conformity to a psychotic official narrative. Not just a regular official narrative, like the Cold War or the War on Terror, or even a myth like the American Dream. A totally delusional official narrative that has little or no connection to reality and that is contradicted by a preponderance of facts Their initiation into the Covidian Cult began in January, when the medical authorities and corporate media turned on The Fear with projections of hundreds of millions of deaths and fake photos of people dropping dead in the streets. The psychological conditioning has continued for months. The global masses have been subjected to a constant stream of propaganda, manufactured hysteria, wild speculation, conflicting directives, exaggerations, lies, and tawdry theatrical effects. Lockdowns. Emergency field hospitals and morgues. The singing-dancing NHS staff. Death trucks. Overflowing ICUs. Dead Covid babies. Manipulated statistics. Goon squads. Masks. And all the rest of it. Eight months later, here we are. The Head of the Health Emergencies Program at the WHO has basically confirmed an IFR of 0.14, approximately the same as the seasonal flu. And here are the latest survival rate estimates from the Center for Disease Control Age 0-19 99.997 Age 20-49 99.98 Age 50-69 99.5 Age 70 94.6The science argument is officially over. An increasing number of doctors and experts are breaking ranks and explaining how the current mass hysteria over so-called cases which now includes perfectly healthy people is essentially meaningless propaganda, for example, in this segment on ARD, one of the big mainstream German TV channels. And then there is the existence of Sweden, and other countries which are not playing ball with the official Covid-19 narrative, which makes a mockery of the ongoing hysteria.118 Guillotines, Motherer Colorado Democratic Committee Member Caught on Hidden Camera Talking Violent Revolution119 Prominent Colorado Democrat Khristopher Jacks, who sits on the executive committee for the states Democratic party and chairman of leftist organization Our Revolution was caught on undercover footage by Project Veritas promoting a violent agenda for far-left Democrats if President Trump wins in November. I am going to do everything morally acceptable to win. I will lie. I will cheat. I will steal. Because thats morally acceptable in this political environment. Absolutely. We are pirates on a pirate ship, said Jacks, who functions as trainer, mentor and on-the-ground quarterback at Our Revolution protests. I want to make this point very loudly and very clearly. I said it nicely before, but Ill say it more curtly now. 2020 is a political revolution, he added Jacks deleted his Twitter account following the Project Veritas release.120 A 9 Hour Wait? Early Voting is Shattering Previous Levels as Voters Flock to the Polls in Droves121 Would you be willing to wait more than 9 hours to cast a vote on the very first day of early voting? As you will see below, that is precisely what just happened in Georgia. We have become accustomed to seeing long lines to vote on Election Day, but in 2020 we are witnessing colossal lines to vote three weeks before the election. And this is happening even though tens of millions of Americans will be casting their votes through the mail this year. The numbers that I am going to share with you in this article are eye-popping, and they seem to indicate that there is an unprecedented amount of interest in this election. In recent months there has been a tremendous nationwide effort to encourage people to vote in 2020, and it appears that it is working. A professor at the University of Florida named Michael McDonald is compiling voting data from all 50 states, and his numbers show that more than 11.9 million Americans have voted so far in 2020. But back in 2016, only about 1.4 million voters had cast ballots as of October 16th. Of course one of the big reasons why so many Americans have voted already is because voting by mail has been aggressively pushed all over the nation this time around.122 After Tearing Down Statues of Lincoln amp38 Roosevelt, Leftists Unveil Statue Thats a Giant Pile of Trash123 The statue, which theyre calling the second Nightmare Elk, is a giant pile of trash.

For example, on Aug. 28, Gov. Charlie Baker issued an executive order to allow the state Department of Early Education and Care to issue guidelines to provide for the creation of remote learning enrichment programs in which children who are enrolled in school during the hours of a school day can attend remote learning instruction. Also, the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education released guidance called Care Options for Hybrid and Remote Learning Models. While neither of these explicitly interfere with the ability of parents to homeschool or to create homeschool co-ops or pods, the devil is in the details. The guidelines state that entities that provide supervision and care of children during school hours without an EEC license or EEC license exemption will be subject to investigation, closure, and fines by EEC pursuant to its statutory obligation to investigate unlicensed child care programs. Massachusetts is by no means the only state to do such a thing. In Oregon, state authorities may actually require a permit for families to get together. Sadly, the existence of such policies forces families to pore over pages and pages of regulations to figure out whether a new policy applies to what churches, community groups, or families are doing. If parents have developed a group to care for their own children, even with the help of trusted adults, they should not be required to wade through state guidelines and risk being investigated. Our first response should be to empower parents to grapple with the uncertainties of educating their children during the pandemic. We can trust parents to figure out what is best for their kids. School officials in Tewksbury, Massachusetts, are demanding parents to comply with requests that are not permitted by the law. For instance, Massachusetts homeschoolers are not required to document and prove residency status, provide the birth certificates of their children, participate in quarterly Zoom meetings, or submit multiple assessments.128 Biden or Die Sign Spotted in Denver129 A woman in Denver is selling Biden or Die campaign signs as a sure fire way of winning hearts and minds as election day looms closer. The signs are being sold for a whopping 32 by a woman called Kate McNally on her website Midnight Grim, which also sells Clarity Cards, including one that says compassion oh, the irony. We cannot let dumpy win! All proceeds go to making more stuff like this for my own neighborhood, states the description for the product. As the National Pulse highlights, McNally appears to have an obsession with the occult.130 Bombshell Audio Biden, Obama Reportedly Didnt Really Want to Get Osama Bin Laden, He Was Being Protected131 National File can provide recordings of a conversation between former U.S. Rep. Curt Weldon R-PA, Alan Howell Parrot, the CEO of The Union for the Conservation of Raptors UCR, and Biden associate and attorney Brian Ettinger, in which Parrot claims he has verifiable intelligence about the whereabouts and patterns of movement of Al-Qaeda terrorist leader Osama bin Laden who, according to Parrot, traveled to Iran for extended stays in which he would vacation and participate in elite level falconry hunting. According to Parrot in the conversation recorded on June 2, 2011, bin Laden traveled to Iran for between three and five months each year for the purpose of participating in elite level falconry hunting. Parrot explained to Weldon that he learned this when speaking directly with those responsible for organizing the hunts, who offered extensive details about bin Ladens whereabouts in the country, information about a temporary hostage used to insure bin Ladens good behavior while in the country, and other sensitive information about the terrorist leader.132 CDC 85 of COVID-19 Patients Report Always Or Often Wearing a Mask133 An underreported, recently-published CDC study adds to the pile of evidence that cloth masks or other forms of mandated face coverings only contribute negatives to our COVID-19 problem. The study also displays  despite the constant accusations of widespread misbehavior from public health officials  that Americans are adhering to mask wearing, but mask wearing is not doing us any good.134 Chuck Grassley Suggests CIA Director Gina Haspel May be Part of Coup to Take Down Trump135 Chuck Grassley has been trying to get remaining Russiagate documents from CIA Director Gina Haspel, but shes been stonewalling and refusing to comply.

It surfaced on Sunday and shows the three talking about the blackmail extortion of 152 Billion US dollars, that was sent to Iran to cover up the deaths of Seal Team 6 by the ObamaBiden administration. Parrot, a former CIA agent, has extensive experience with the intelligence community, and he is planning on releasing documents this week on what he said are going to uncover numerous crimes sprees.

Phyllis Hamilton, a federal judge for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, said excluding incarcerated people from the stimulus package is arbitrary and that nothing in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act bars inmates from receiving funds. The decision came after an incarcerated man and a group of formerly incarcerated women filed suit on behalf of the 1.5 million prisoners across the country. The IRS had originally sent payment to prisoners, but later told prison officials to collect and return checks that arrived at facilities for prisoners.142 Gates Says Life Can Return to Normal Only After We Pay Him for the Second Generation of Vaccines143 The only way well get completely back to normal is by having, maybe not the first generation of vaccines, but eventually a vaccine that is super-effective, and that a lot of the people take, and that we get the disease eliminated on a global basis, Gates said Sunday in an interview on NBCs Meet the Press program. That is where we can finally start taking all the problems that have been created  in education, mental health  and start to build back in a positive way. According to that standard, Americans might need to live for years, or for life, under social-distancing guidelines and other Covid-19 restrictions. Its certainly gloomier than the assessment Gates gave in a Fox interview last month, when he said progress on vaccines might make it possible for a return to normalcy in the US by the summer of 2021.144 Georgia Rep.

The report states that the emails suggest the younger Biden introduced his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden, to the executive, Vadym Pozharskyi.

The electric car company says that a Russian-speaking employee was offered 1 million dollars to insert malware into its network so certain nefarious actors could extract data. Instead of taking the bait, the employee  a worker at Teslas Nevada Gigafactory  reported the scheme to Tesla, who asked the FBI to intervene. The ensuing trap involved the employee wearing a wire and extracting key info from the hacker, who was eventually arrested as he attempted to flee the country. Close call, right? Well, unfortunately Tesla barely had a chance to exhale before reports surfaced that the company had been the target of another attempt at malicious sabotage  but this time it appears to have been an internal attempt. Legal establishments are still holding their collective breath over the possibility of hackers inducing potentially fatal software faults in electric vehiclesnot to mention driverless cars. Burning battery packs represent a nightmare for accident response teams Conductive i.e., ordinary water not being the best option to extinguish such fires.188 The Cultural Failure That Makes Spouting Nonsense About Trump Possible189 Like an immense mythological monster, Media Trump Hate must be hurled each week, or sometimes more often, in an arsenic-laced dosage of malicious fiction at the Trump campaign. There have been so many of them that very few can now be remembered even those that were momentarily taken seriously by reputable observers, such as the idea that lawyer Michael Cohen paying blackmail to Stormy Daniels, constituted an illegal campaign donation.  This is the Red Queen school of evidence-gathering and prosecution followed by almost the entire U.S. media in respect of the president. This is the same refined school of jurisprudence exhibited by that well-known jurisconsult Don Lemon CNN when he declares that any reference by President Trump to the existence of any human beings of a different pigmentation to himself constitutes a racially charged statement. Nothing could be simpler the week has not gone by when the president has said or done something or failed to say or do something which must be assumed to be the cause of a real or apprehended unpleasant event.190 Trump I Was Right About Damaging Lockdowns191 During his first rally since swiftly defeating coronavirus, President Trump again slammed lockdown policies, and declared that he was right about resisting them all along, after the World Health Organisation admitted that countries should not be using lockdowns as a way of controlling the virus.192 Trump Biden Son-in-Law Cashing in On Coronavirus193 President Trump told a huge crowd in Pennsylvania Tuesday that Joe Bidens family is cashing in on the coronavirus.

Joe Bidens trust in truth, evidence, science and democracy make him the only choice in the US election.198 Why Democrats Hate Amy Coney Barrett199 This week, Democrats struggled to explain why Judge Amy Coney Barrett should not be confirmed to serve on the Supreme Court. They trotted out hackneyed arguments, suggesting that some political norm had been broken by a Republican president nominating a judge to be confirmed as a justice by a Republican Senate in an election year. There have been 19 times where a seat became vacant in an election year and both the presidency and Senate were controlled by the same party, resulting in 17 judicial confirmations. They suggested that Ruth Bader Ginsburgs dying wish to leave her seat open until a Democrat takes power represented a sort of binding legal commitment. And they fumed. They fumed that Barrett refuses to pledge fealty to their political priorities. They fumed that Barrett has stated that the role of the judiciary is not to achieve moral ends but to enforce the law. They fumed that Barrett had the temerity to state that courts are not designed to solve every problem or right every wrong in our public life, that the policy decisions and value judgments of government must be made by the political branches and that she has done her utmost to reach the result required by the law, whatever her preferences might be. Thats because, in the view of the political left, the court ought to be merely another weapon in its political arsenal.200 BAME People Are Over-Represented on TV Ethnic Minorities Make Up 22 of Actors and Presenters While Only Representing 12 of British Population, Research Shows201 Ethnic minorities are overrepresented as actors and presenters on British television but continue to be sidelined off screen, new research suggests.

Nicholas Whitcombe previously announced via a YouTube video that his Bodytec Fitness gym, which is located in Wirral, would be remaining open despite a new law that mandates all gyms in the region close their doors due to a rise in coronavirus infections. The UKs Government has took it upon themselves to close gyms in the North West, despite the overwhelming evidence that gyms are not a major spreaders of COVID, says a description on his fundraiser page.258 G20 Interfaith Forum Urges Putting Human Dignity Back at the Center Of Global Debate259 As leaders from ten different religious traditions gathered through Zoom at an interfaith forum hosted in Saudi Arabia, Pope Franciss latest document on human fraternity had a central place in the discussions.260 Two Months After Pioneering Sputnik V Launched, Putin Announces Registration of 2nd Russian COVID-19 Vaccine, Says 3rd on Way261 President Vladimir Putin announced on Wednesday that Russia has registered its second domestic Covid-19 vaccine, with a third already on the way. A phase-three trial, with 40,000 volunteers, is due to begin in the near future. In August, Russia was the first country to announce the registration of a Covid-19 vaccine, which has since been taken by thousands of Muscovites, as part of its final trial phase. With a second formula registered and another around the corner, Russia will soon have a wide range of options. The name of the new vaccine is EpiVacCorona and it is being produced in Siberia by Vector, a biological research center. Located near the city of Novosibirsk, Vector is a world-class virology and biotechnology facility, and has one of the worlds most comprehensive collections of viruses, including Ebola, SARS, and smallpox.262 Azerbaijan, Armenia Trade Accusations of Breaking Cease-Fire in Nagorno-Karabakh263 Russia on Wednesday proposed sending military observers to monitor a shaky cease-fire in the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh, amid mutual recriminations between Armenia and Azerbaijan over alleged truce violations. In the Azerbaijani capital of Baku, officials accused Armenia of trying to attack Azerbaijans petroleum pipelines. In turn, Armenian officials said Azerbaijan was trying to seize Nagorno-Karabakh despite the cease-fire.264 New Species of Water Bear Uses Fluorescent Shield To Survive Lethal UV Radiation265 Tardigrades, small aquatic creatures known as water bears, can survive extreme heat, radiation, and even the vacuum of outer spaceconditions that would kill most animals. Now, scientists have discovered a new species of tardigrade that can endure ultraviolet UV light so lethal, it is regularly used to get rid of hard-to-kill viruses and bacteria. The discovery was made by chance Researchers at the Indian Institute of Science scoured their campus for water bears, and then exposed them to extreme conditions. They happened to have a germicidal UV lamp in the lab, so they hit their specimens with it. The dose of 1 kilojoule per square meter, which killed bacteria and roundworms after just 5 minutes, was lethal to Hypsibius exemplaris tardigrades at 15 minutes most died after 24 hours. But when they hit a strange, reddish brown species with the same dose, all survived. Whats more, when the researchers upped the dose four times, about 60 of the reddish brown bears lived for more than 30 days. The researchers realized they had found a new species of tardigrade, part of the Paramacrobiotus genus. To figure out how the new specieswhich was found living in moss on a concrete wall in Bengaluru, Indiasurvived, the scientists examined it with an inverted fluorescence microscope. To their surprise, under the UV light, the reddish tardigrades became blue above. Fluorescent pigments, likely located under the tardigrades skin, transformed the UV light into harmless blue light, the team reports today in Biology Letters. In contrast, Paramacrobiotus with less pigment died about 20 days after exposure.266 Tech Companies Race to Create Social Distancing Surveillance Tech to Police the Public267 A Japanese tech company has developed a fish bubble to enforce social distancing. The fish bubble is the latest of weird technologies launched in an effort to police the post-corona-lockdown world. A video posted by NHK News in Japan shows that Hitachi has developed a fish bubble to help with social distancing. The technology uses sensors to detect the location of a person. Then it projects a 2-meter bubble circle around the person, with animated fish swimming inside. If a person comes too close to another, the fish escape the bubble, which is a warning that the person should change their position. According to the promo video, the company hopes to commercialize the technology soon. China is already working on integrating social distancing technology into its controversial and burdensome social credit score system. So, in the near future, Chinese residents might start accruing fines for breaking social distancing regulations.268 Daniel Andrews Office is Vandalised for the Second Time in Three Weeks  With the Words Sack Dan Painted in Red and Windows Shattered by Bricks269 The words Sack Dan were painted across the windows and door of Mr Andrews parliamentary office in Melbournes Noble Park, on Wednesday night.270 Karen From Brighton Flees Victoria Woman Who Went Viral After Slamming Dan Andrews Lockdown of Melbourne is Living a Far Better Life After Heading to the Northern Territory271 Jodi Grollo went viral after slamming Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews on a news segment about his harsh 5km travel limits.272 Trapped Down Under Scott Morrison Says Australians Wont be Allowed Overseas for The Foreseeable Future  And Refuses to Put a Date on Travel Bubbles With Any Safe Countries273 Since 17 March Aussies have been banned from leaving the country unless they are going for more than three months or have an exemption.274 Victorias Top Doctor Admits the Government Has Powers To Access Peoples Mobile Phones to Check Their Location  After an Infected Melburnian Spawned Two Regional Outbreaks and Lied About His Travel275 Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said Victorian authorities rely on infected coronavirus cases to tell the truth when being investigated by contact tracers.276 Welcome to Dan Andrews Police State, Where Going for a Bike Ride is a Crime Cyclist is Pulled Over and Grilled by Cops While Out Exercising in Melbourne  After a Private Security Guard Claimed He Was Breaking the Law277 The cyclist was riding in an almost empty carpark near the Queen Victoria Markets in Melbournes CBD when he was interrogated by a security guard and police.278 Why its Nearly Impossible to Get a Job in Australia The Ludicrous Number of People Applying for Every Entry-Level Job279 The staggering figure was released by Anglicare Australia on Wednesday to highlight the tough market for jobseekers who face barriers to work.280 14 Farmers Killed in Nigeria by Terrorist Group Boko Haram281 Fourteen farmers were killed in an attack in northeastern Nigeria by members of the Boko Haram terrorist group. According to local media, the terrorists seized 15 farmers working in their fields in Ngwom village, which is nine miles north of the regions main city Maiduguri. The terrorists then fatally cut their throats. One farmer survived with a deep gash. Members of Boko Haram have displaced around 3 million people in more than a decade of horrific activities by the group. Multiple civilians remain trapped in remote communities, and the lack of security on the roads makes it impossible for the captives to flee.282 Glen Snyman South African Accused of Fraud for Saying Hes African283 A South African teacher has been summoned to a disciplinary hearing, accused of fraud, for identifying as African in a job application. Glen Snyman is coloured  as people of mixed race have been known since the country was under white-minority rule. He is the founder of campaign group People Against Race Classification. He opposes the use of race categories black, coloured, Indian and white on official documentation, including job-application forms.284 Almost 1 in 2 Young People in North Africa and the Middle East Want to Migrate, Mainly for Economic Reasons285 The Arab Youth Survey revealed that 42 percent of young people aged 18 to 24 think of trying their luck in a country other than their own, with 15 percent of them have already made their ambition into a reality by taking steps to emigrate. The survey was carried out in 17 countries in North Africa and the Middle East, in which the youth population accounts for about 200 million people. Those 45 percent of young people who want to leave represent 30 million people.286 At Least 851 Illegal Migrants on French Terror Watchlist287 There are at least 851 illegal immigrants on Frances terror watchlist, according to Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin. Interior Minister Darmanin stated on Tuesday that 231 illegal migrants were major risks to French security and needed to be deported. At least 180 of those are currently in French custody.288 Family of Iraqi Asylum-Seekers Fly Into Germany on Private Jet Using Forged Diplomatic Passports289 A family of Iraqi asylum seekers tried to enter Germany on a private jet using fake diplomatic passports, authorities say. The mother, father and two children aged seven and 12 flew into Munich on a Hawker Beechcraft chartered private plane from Istanbul last week. On arrival, they claimed to be diplomats from the Caribbean nation of St Kitts and Nevis, who were travelling on to Dominica after a night in Germany.290 Germany Migrants in Leipzig Refuse Free Housing Not Central Enough or Lacking an Elevator291 Many migrants living in the eastern German city of Leipzig have turned down apartments offered by the municipality-owned Leipzig Housing and Construction Company LWB for being too far from the city center, lacking an elevator or otherwise not meeting their expectations, Berlin-based German weekly Junge Freiheit reports. Leipzigs LWB currently offers free housing 1,972 migrants who have received asylum in the country, and in the last nine months alone, it has received 370 applications for further accommodations and 30 contracts have been signed. More than half of them have been living in the apartments for at least two years, yet the city plans to continue offering every migrant family its own apartment. Still, the LWB reports that many migrants have rejected the new housing, but has not released any official figures about how many.292 German Officials Clash in Parliament Over Berlin-Based NGOs Busted for Migrant Smuggling293 German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas was confronted on the floor of parliament after news broke that Greek authorities had busted a human smuggling network allegedly run by agents of multiple non-governmental organizations NGOs based in Berlin. A total of 33 suspects working for four NGOs were rounded up in late September amid an extensive probe conducted by Greek intelligence and counter-terrorism agencies who believe the trafficking network was engaged in espionage and attacks on national security. Reports indicate NGO operatives coordinated with colleagues and migrants located on Greek islands  particularly Lesvos  to steer thousands of illegal aliens onward from Turkey to European soil. After Infowars Europe brought international attention to the story, German MP Petr Bystron raised the issue with Maas during a session in the Bundestag.294 Pope Francis Meets Parents of Priest Stabbed to Death by Tunisian Immigrant295 ROME  Pope Francis met with the parents of Father Roberto Malgesini, an Italian priest who was stabbed to death last month by a Tunisian immigrant to whom he had given assistance. At around 700am on September 15, the priest was repeatedly stabbed outside his home in the northern Italian city of Como by 53-year-old Mahmoudi Ridha, a Muslim man Father Malgesini had helped on a number of occasions.296 American Conservative Slams US Ambassadors Criticisms of Poland Over LGBT Issues297 I fully respect that Poland is a Catholic country, but you need to know that, regarding LGBT, youre on the wrong side of history, Georgette Mosbacher said in an interview for Polish portal Wirtualna Polska in September. These words caused a massive controversy among Polish conservative public opinion a few weeks ago. Now, the controversy has drawn a reaction from a leading American conservative publication, which points out that the US ambassador crossed a dangerous line. Declan Leary writes in an article for The American Conservative that conservative Poles and their American allies have heard different versions of Mosbachers statement many times and mostly from the US LGBT lobby. What is surprising, he notes, is that it has come from the Trump-appointed ambassador to Poland.298 British Lawmaker Rosie Duffield Faces Online Backlash, Death Threats for Suggestion Only Woman Have a Cervix299 Its not unusual for transgender women andor activists standing up for their causes to appear notably combative and aggressive in online conversations  if they perceived them in any way challenging their identity or reality. A trans woman would be an individual assigned male at birth, the definition has it. And when women assigned female at birth have anything remotely controversial, or simply undesired to say about the subject, they are often faced with extreme hostility. This process is what spawned the TERF acronym, meaning, trans-exclusionary radical feminist, and some well-known public figures like celebrated author J.K. Rowling have been labeled as such. UK Labour MP Rosie Duffield has now joined this club, recently getting harassed online, all the way to receiving death threats because of her comments and interviews, where she expressed that in her opinion, only women have a cervix.300 Ex-Facebook Honcho Tim Kendall Says Big Tech is a Threat to Democracy,  Calls for Social Media Reform301 The attention-based business model of social media companies is a threat to democracy, Tim Kendall says302 Netherlands Legalizes Child Euthanasia Despite Opposition From Christian Parties303 The Dutch government will allow doctors to euthanize terminally ill children as young as one year old, making the Netherlands the second country in the world to permit the practice. Health Minister Hugo de Jonge announced the change in a letter to Parliament on Tuesday, calling the decision necessary to help a small group of terminally ill children who are suffering hopelessly and unbearably. The decision does not amend any laws, but exempts doctors from prosecution for ending a childs life in certain conditions and with parental consent. Children between the ages of one and 12 will now be eligible for assisted suicide, whereas previously only newborn infants and teenagers could be euthanized.304 Oreo Hands Out Rainbow-Colored Cookies in Support of LGBT History Month305 Oreo, produced by Nabisco, is giving away limited-edition Oreo cookies filled with rainbow colored creme in celebration of LGBT History Month. The company gave away 10,000 packages of special edition ProudParent Oreo cookies last Friday to people who shared a photo on social media showing what LGBT allyship means to them.306 Supreme Court Upholds Previous Rulings, Rejects South Carolinas Appeal to End Public Funding for Planned Parenthood307 The U.S. Supreme Court rejected an effort by South Carolina leaders to cut off public funding for two Planned Parenthood clinics that provide abortions. The Supreme Court would not consider an appeal by Gov. Henry McMaster that would remove two Planned Parenthood clinics from the states Medicaid network. Instead, it upheld previous rulings, requiring South Carolina to reimburse Planned Parenthood clinics that treat Medicaid patients.308 Websters Dictionary Rewritten in Real Time After ACB Hearing Suggestion Sexual Preference Is Offensive309 The English language is undergoing a fast-tracked and forced devolution, championed by certain political and media circles, mostly centering around sexual and other identity politics. And online dictionaries like Merriam-Webster are keeping up with this process rather efficiently, almost in real time. This time, it was the term preference that got a makeover when denoting orientation, as in, sexual preference, the word is now labeled as offensive as of yesterday.310 World Economic Forum Outlines Its Great Reset To End Traditional Capitalism311 The coronavirus crisis presents an opportunity for a new kind of capitalism and great reset of global economies, politics, and societies, according to World Economic Forum WEF founder and executive chairman Klaus Schwab. In an article published Monday by the WEF, an impatient Schwab claims neo-liberalism is dead and with it traditional notions of economic capitalism. In their place is a set of Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics the WEF says enables the world to progress under one set of overarching rules as drawn up by it, with social justice a key component of this brave new world. This restructure of the way we do business is the new model for the great reset Schwab argues, adding he foresees the coronavirus crisis as too good an opportunity not to re-evaluate sacred cows of the pre-pandemic system.312 YouTube to Delete Videos That Go Against the Who Consensus on Future Coronavirus Vaccines313 Just to be clear as of this time, there is no such thing as a coronavirus COVID vaccine. That means that, technically, any information about such a vaccine, whether positive or negative, claiming it to be either safe or unsafe, can be viewed as factual falsehood and ultimately, a conspiracy theory  since conspiracy theories are typically based on insufficient evidence, yet are promoted as self-evident truths. But YouTube has announced that it will only clamp down on content that is negative or suspicious about some future vaccine. That means that if you were to make a video praising this non-existent thing and upload it to the platform, that would be fine  however unproven and unprovable at this moment.314 Rare Magnetism Found in the Worlds Strongest Material315 Graphene, one of the worlds strongest materials, isnt normally magnetic. But when stacked and twisted, graphene develops a rare form of magnetism, new research finds. The magnetic field isnt created by the usual spin of electrons within the individual graphene layers, but instead arises from the collective swirling of electrons in all of the three-layers of the stacked graphene structure, researchers reported Oct. 12 in the journal Nature Physics. Graphene is a material made of a single layer or monolayer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb pattern. Its incredibly light and strong though it is vulnerable to cracking. It also conducts electricity, making it exciting for use in electronics and sensors. Two dimensional i.e., single atomic thickness materials promise all sorts of unexpected properties.316 Room-Temperature Superconductivity in a Carbonaceous Sulfur Hydride317 One of the long-standing challenges in experimental physics is the observation of room-temperature superconductivity. Recently, high-temperature conventional superconductivity in hydrogen-rich materials has been reported in several systems under high pressure. An important discovery leading to room-temperature superconductivity is the pressure-driven disproportionation of hydrogen sulfide H2S to H3S, with a confirmed transition temperature of 203 kelvin at 155 gigapascals. It is important to distinguish between room temperature and high temperature superconductivity. High temperature superconductivity occurs well above absolute zero 0 K  273.15 C or 459.67 F in the relatively balmy reaches of liquid nitrogen 77K  195.79 C or 320 F. Actual room temperature superconductivity represents the holy grail of electrical transmission due to zero-loss conduction without the need for cryogenic refrigeration. As an example One way of improving high tension transmission of electricity would be to encase all long line wires in vacuum barrier housings. Much like a thermos bottle, these LN 2 filled casings would maintain low temperature conductivity and improve the electrical efficiency of existing grid transmission infrastructure. Elimination of these carrier losses is so vital that the expense could even be used to justify such technology. The complexity of installation and maintenance represent insurmountable support issues but the general concept still stands. Bearing that in mind, if economical155 gigapascal pressures 1 GPa  20,885,433.788371 psf most likely were obtained using diamond anvil technologysuperconductivity were achievable at ambient pressures and temperatures, this would represent an advance comparable with sustained, payback-level fusion power generation. A coffee can-sized paddle wheel superconducting generator dipped into a stream outside your mountain cabin could run its stove, laundry, microwave oven, and refrigerator all at once. Although the foregoing example might be a slight exaggeration, it provides insight with respect to the possibilities opened up by room temperature superconducting motors. Electrically powered aircraft and long-haul freight trucks would be childs play. The ancient alchemical element of sulfur holds many other promises. Among them is black silicon which is capable of emitting and detecting light. This may be critical to intermediate technology optical computingas a stepping stone to fully light-based integrated circuits.318  1 424067  2 424103  3 424041  4 424101  5 424127  6 424033  7 424039  8 424069  9 424083  10 424153  11 424055  12 424131  13 424079  14 424045  15 424061  16 424059  17 424129  18 424143  19 424047  20 424157  21 424065  22 424195  23 424203  24 424057  25 424027  26 424049  27 424115  28 424075  29 424197  30 424073  31 424077  32 424085  33 424109  34 424081  35 424113  36 424155  37 424107  38 424141  39 424139  40 424199  41 424019  42 424035  43 424053  44 424137  45 424151  46 424009  47 424071  48 424017  49 424161  50 424173  51 424163  52 424207  53 424159  54 424185  55 424225  56 424063  57 424227  58 424167  59 424099  60 424175  61 424217  62 424171  63 424119  64 424037  65 424111  66 424051  67 424213  68 424209  69 424007  70 424219  71 424135  72 424133  73 424211  74 424121  75 424221  76 424125  77 424043  78 424123  79 424105  80 424023  81 424193  82 424179  83 424093  84 424182  85 424030  86 424090  87 424088  88 424147  89 424015  90 424165  91 424205  92 424201  93 424169  94 424223  95 424215  96 424177  97 424189  98 424013  99 424117  100 424149  101 424145  102 424191  103 424011  104 424187  105 424025  106 424021  107 rblacklistednewshKxa3JrtkK18Aj7simf-seizes-on-pandemic-to-pave-way-for-privatization-in-81.html  108 topheadline  109  110 topheadline  111  112 topheadline  113  114 topheadline  115  116 topheadline  117  118 topheadline  119  120 topheadline  121  122 topheadline  123  124 topheadline  125  126 topheadline  127  128 topheadline  129  130 topheadline  131  132 topheadline  133  134 topheadline  135  136 topheadline  137  138 topheadline  139  140 topheadline  141  142 topheadline  143  144 topheadline  145  146 topheadline  147 rblacklistednewshKxa3pWSl0z4qJe8johnson-amp-johnson-pauses-covid19-vaccine-trial-after-unexplained.html  148 topheadline  149  150 topheadline  151  152 topheadline  153  154 topheadline  155  156 topheadline  157  158 topheadline  159  160 topheadline  161  162 topheadline  163  164 topheadline  165 rSHTFplan3tTasg8bMlusnyc-begins-extortive-tyranny-punishes-people-for-covid-19-violations  166 topheadline  167  168 topheadline  169  170 topheadline  171  172 topheadline  173  174 topheadline  175  176 topheadline  177  178 topheadline  179  180 topheadline  181  182 topheadline  183  184 topheadline  185  186 topheadline  187  188 topheadline  189  190 topheadline  191  192 topheadline  193  194 topheadline  195  196 topheadline  197  198 topheadline  199  200 topheadline  201  202 topheadline  203  204 topheadline  205  206 topheadline  207  208 topheadline  209  210 topheadline  211  212 topheadline  213  214 topheadline  215  216 topheadline  217 rblacklistednewshKxa3iFZ8F_jhFNkhow-uk-trackandtrace-data-from-restaurants-is-being-harvested-and.html  218 topheadline  219  220 topheadline  221  222 topheadline  223  224 topheadline  225  226 topheadline  227  228 topheadline  229  230 topheadline  231  232 topheadline  233  234 topheadline  235  236 topheadline  237  238 topheadline  239  240 topheadline  241  242 topheadline  243  244 topheadline  245  246 topheadline  247  248 topheadline  249  250 topheadline  251  252 topheadline  253  254 topheadline  255  256 topheadline  257  258 topheadline  259  260 topheadline  261  262 topheadline  263  264 topheadline  265  266 topheadline  267  268 topheadline  269  270 topheadline  271  272 topheadline  273  274 topheadline  275  276 topheadline  277  278 topheadline  279  280 topheadline  281  282 topheadline  283  284 topheadline  285  286 topheadline  287  288 topheadline  289  290 topheadline  291  292 topheadline  293  294 topheadline  295  296 topheadline  297  298 topheadline  299  300 topheadline  301  302 topheadline  303  304 topheadline  305  306 topheadline  307  308 topheadline  309  310 topheadline  311  312 topheadline  313  314 topheadline  315  316 topheadline  317  318 topheadline",homeless
portland,What Republicans and Billionaires Really Mean When They Talk About 'Freedom',2019-03-20T00:00:00Z,Naked Capitalism,The Oregonian,"Nixon Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell codified the strategy for this initiative in the so-called Powell Memo of 1971. One of the most effective spokesmen for this libertarian program was Milton Friedman, whose bestseller Free to Choose became the foundation for a ten-part TV series. By Thom Hartman, atalk-show host1and author of more than25 books in print2. He is a writing fellow at the Independent Media Institute3. Produced by the Independent Media Institute4 America is having a heated debate about the meaning of the word socialism. Wed be better served if, instead, we were debating the meaning of freedom. The Oregonian5reported last week that fully 156,000 families are on the edge of homelessness in our small-population state. Every one of those households is now paying more than 50 percent of its monthly income on rent, and none of them has any savings one medical bill, major car repair or job loss, and theyre on the streets. While socialism may or may not solve their problem, the more pressing issue we have is an entire political party and a huge sector of the billionaire class who see homelessness not as a problem, but as a symptom of a free society. The words freedomand libertyare iconic in American cultureprobably more so than with any other nation because theyre so intrinsic to the literature, declarations and slogans of our nations founding. The ironyof the nation founded on the worlds greatest known genocide the systematic state murder of tens of millions of Native Americans and over three centuries of legalized slavery and a century and a half of oppression and exploitation of the descendants of those slavesis extraordinary. It presses us all to bring truefreedom and liberty to allAmericans. But what do those words mean? If you ask the Koch brothers and their buddieswho slap those words on pretty much everything they doyoud get a definition that largely has to do with being free from taxation and regulation. And, truth be told, if youre morbidly rich, that makes a certain amount of sense, particularly if your main goal is to get richer and richer, regardless of your behaviors impact on working-class people, the environment, or the ability of government to function. On the other hand, the definition of freedom and liberty thats been embraced by so-called democratic socialist countriesfrom Canada to almost all of Europe to Japan and Australiayoud hear a definition thats closer to that articulated by Franklin D. Roosevelt when he proposed, in January 1944, a second Bill of Rights6 to be added to our Constitution. FDRs proposed amendments included the rightto a job, and the rightto be paid enough to live comfortably the rightto adequate food and clothing and recreation the rightto start a business and run it without worrying about unfair competition and domination by monopolies the rightof every family to a decent home the rightto adequate medical care to achieve and enjoy good health the rightto government-based protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment and the rightto a good education. Roosevelt pointed out that, All of these rights spell security. He added, Americas own rightful place in the world depends in large part upon how fully these and similar rights have been carried into practice for our citizens. For unless there is security here at home there cannot be lasting peace in the world. The other nations mentioned earlier took President Roosevelts advice to heart. Progressive social democracy has kept Europe, Canada, and the developed nations of the East and South Pacific free of war for almost a centurya mind-boggling feat when considering the history of the developed world since the 1500s. Just prior to FDR winning the White House in the election of 1932, the nation had been treated to 12 years of a bizarre Republican administration that was the model for todays GOP. In 1920, Warren Harding won the presidency on a campaign of more industry in government, less government in industryprivatize and deregulateand a promise to drop the top tax rate of 91 percent down to 25 percent. He kept both promises, putting the nation into a sugar-high spin called the Roaring 20s, where the rich got fabulously rich and working-class people were being beaten and murdered by industrialists when they tried to unionize. Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover the three Republican presidents from 1920 to 1932 all cheered on the assaults, using phrases like the right to work to describe a union-free nation. In the end, the result of the horses and sparrows7 economics advocated by Harding feed more oats to the horses and therell be more oats in the horse poop to fatten the sparrowsthat generations version of trickle-down economics was the Republican Great Depression yes, they called it that until after World War II. Even though Roosevelt was fabulously popularthe only president to be elected four timesthe right-wingers of his day were loud and outspoken in their protests of what they called socialist programs like Social Security, the right to unionize, and government-guaranteed job programs including the WPA, REA, CCC, and others. The Klan and American Nazis were assembling by the hundreds of thousands nationwidenearly 30,000 in Madison Square Garden8 aloneencouraged by wealthy and powerful economic royalists preaching freedom and liberty9. Like the Kochs Freedomworks10, that generations huge and well-funded principally by the DuPonts chemical fortune organization was the Liberty League11. Roosevelts generation had seen the results of this kind of hard-right freedom rhetoric in Italy, Spain, Japan and Germany, the very nations with which we were then at war. Speaking of the grave dangers of rightist reaction in this Nation, Roosevelt told America12in that same speech that If history were to repeat itself and we were to return to the so-called normalcy of the 1920sthen it is certain that even though we shall have conquered our enemies on the battlefields abroad, we shall have yielded to the spirit of Fascism here at home. Although right-wingers are still working hard to disassemble FDRs New Dealthe GOP budget for 2019 contains massive cuts to Social Security, as well as to Medicare and Medicaidwe got halfway toward his notion of freedom and liberty here in the United StatesYoure not free if youre old and deep in poverty, so we have Social Security although the GOP wants to gut it. Youre not free if youre hungry, so we have food stampsSNAP although the GOP wants to gut them. Youre not free if youre homeless, so we have housing assistance and homeless shelters although the GOP fights every effort to help homeless people. Youre not free if youre sick and cant get medical care, so we have Medicare, Medicaid, and Obamacare although the GOP wants to gut them all. Youre not free if youre working more than 40 hours a week and still cant meet basic expenses, so we have minimum wage laws and the right to unionize although the GOP wants to gut both. Youre not free if you cant read, so we have free public schools although the GOP is actively working to gut them. Youre not free if you cant vote, so weve passed numerous laws to guarantee the right to vote although the GOP is doing everything it can to keep tens of millions of Americans from voting.The billionaire class and their wholly owned Republican politicians keep trying to tell us that freedom means the government doesnt provide anyof the things listed above. Instead, they tell us as Ron Paul famously did13 in a GOP primary debate years ago that, if were broke and sick, were free to die like a feral dog in the gutter. Freedom is homelessness, in the minds of the billionaires who own the GOP. Poverty, lack of education, no access to health care, poor-paying jobs, and barriers to voting are all proof of a free society, they tell us, which is why Americas lowest life expectancy, highest maternal and childhood death rates, lowest levels of education, and lowest pay are almost all in GOP-controlled states14. Americaparticularly the Democratic Partyis engaged in a debate right now about the meaning of socialism. It would be a big help for all of us if we were, instead, to have an honest debate about the meaning of the words freedomand liberty.

portland,People are spreading rumors that the Oregon wildfires were lit by radical activists. Twitter still hasn't taken them down.,2020-09-11T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,The Oregonian,"Business Insider has contacted the company for comment. Visit Business Insiders homepage for more stories2.Groundless claims linking both left- and right-wing activists to the raging wildfires in Oregon3 are continuing to circulate on Twitter, and police forces are scrambling to stop the rumors.Among the posts that swirled around Twitter and Facebook include a mocked-up police post and tweets by Republican activists, many claiming without evidence are being deliberately caused by members of antifa or the right-wing group Proud Boys.Some of those posts are still active on Twitter. Business Insider has contacted the company for comment.For instance, a Wednesday tweet that claimed that the fires that are happening are a terrorist attack by antifa, citing what the user called Police scanner Medford, is still on Twitter on Friday. Bon BonnieAnkle September 9, 20204 Katie Daviscourt, who described herself as a representative of conservative group Turning Point USA, has also been tweeting similar rumors about the situation in Molalla to her 55,000-plus followers. All of those posts are still on the platform.In one Thursday tweet, she cited multiple sources in Emergency Response to say that the fires along the West Coast are allegedly linked to antifa and the Riots. Katie Daviscourt KatieDaviscourt September 10, 20205 She included a Molalla Police Department statement, which asked people in the area to please report any suspicious activity. The force has since clarified its Facebook statement, saying This is about possible looters, not antifa or setting of fires. There has been NO antifa in town as of this posting at 0200 am Thursday.That tweet has been shared widely, with around 2,900 retweets as of Friday. In a separate tweet on Friday, Daviscourt wrote6 Im not going to stop reporting on the West Coast ARSONS ... Send me everything you got!Business Insider has contacted Daviscourt and Turning Point USA for comment, but did not immediately receive a reply from either.Paul Romero Jr., who unsuccessfully ran for Senate as a Republican in May, also tweeted unfounded claims on Wednesday about so-called antifa involvement in setting fires, saying It seems those individuals who have been setting fires in Oregon ... well, six of them are in custody. All are antifa. Paul J. Romero, Jr. for OREGON PJR4Senate September 9, 20207 The post has been shared hundreds of times. Romero did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Posts containing rumors about the wildfires have also proliferated on Facebook.The Medford Police Department in Oregon singled out one post that was designed to imitate the forces official page, which falsely said that five Proud Boys membershad been arrested with firestarting implements in connection with the fires.Medford Police later issued a statement to flag the mocked-up post, and clarified We did not arrest this person for arson, nor anyone affiliated with antifa or Proud Boys as weve heard throughout the day.Business Insider was unable to find the post on Facebook, which suggests it may have been taken down from the site. Facebook did not immediately respond to Business Insiders request for comment. 911 dispatchers overrun with rumors At least four law-enforcement departments in Oregon have issued statements against the misinformation.In a Thursday Facebook post, the Jackson Countys Sheriffs Office said8 There are numerous FALSE reports of arrests and other situations over the past days that are the content of postings, fake stories and gossip.Please dont re-post and spread misinformation based on some unverified random post or meme, it added. Rumors make the job of protecting the community more difficult.The sheriffs office in Douglas County also said9 on Thursday that disinformation has spread like wildfire on social media, and that its 911 dispatchers are being overrun with queries about antifa members supposedly being arrested for arson.Police forces in Medford10 and Molalla11 have also had to post statements to their official Facebook pages clarifying that the posts are untrue.So far, five Oregon towns have been substantially destroyed by the wildfire, Gov. Kate Brown said earlier this week12,and thousands of people have been left homeless, The Oregonian reported13.The Jackson County Sheriffs Office have opened a criminal investigation into the starting of the fire, Fox 12 Oregon reported14.Some arrests are being made in areas affected by fire for example, acouple has been arrested15 in Madera County, California, in the fire exclusion zone with bomb-making materials.However, Business Insider did not find any official police announcements linking any arrests to political groups.

portland,Amazon could detonate a gentrification 'prosperity bomb' in the mystery city of its new headquarters,2017-09-12T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,The Oregonian,"The company said on Thursday2 that it plans to invest 5 billion in the construction of the new campus, dubbed HQ2, where it hopes to eventually staff 50,000 Amazon employees. CEO Jeff Bezos said it will be equal in size to Amazons current headquarters in the Seattle area, where the company grew from a small set-up in Bezos garage into a global e-commerce giant. Cities in the running include Philadelphia, Denver, Chicago, San Jose, and Toronto. Many city leaders are optimistic about the thousands of jobs and massive tax cuts Amazon claims HQ2 would create. But some residents worry that it will also spur the same problems Seattle has seen since Amazon arrived in the late 1990s increased traffic, soaring housing prices, and prolonged construction. In The Oregonian, a Portland resident questioned3 how the city would cope with the population growth HQ2 would bring. Meanwhile, Philadelphia Inquirer columnist Will Bunch worries4 about higher rents that could price out young artists and dreamers ... crushing any and all cultural diversity and vibrancy. James Thomson, an ex-head of Amazon Services the division that recruits sellers to the companys marketplaces, told5 the Toronto Star Sunday that inviting an Amazon HQ is a trade-off against schools, infrastructure, and health care. Can Toronto support 50,000 high-net earners who all want nice homes, nice restaurants, easy commutes? Amazon is NOT a fan of unions or regulation.Tweet Embed being in Philly would be a disaster for the citys most vulnerable citizens and supercharge gentrificationTweet Embed Some thoughts to ponder Traffic is a mess in Seattle, thanks in part to Amazon in the center of the city SiliconValley6 AmazonHQ27Tweet Embed PhillyMayor8 No Amazon Headquarters in Philly. No. No. No. No. No9 Gentrification10Tweet Embed definitely not in SF. no more gentrification!! Embed Quality snark with a point. City that wins Amazon HQ2 gets, duh, jobs. And inequality, gentrification, etc. Happy bidding. Embed I live on the Westside and I know gentrification is coming. Amazon deals speed up the process when Denver13 COULD be helping its people firstAmazon is the largest property taxpayer and private employer in Seattle. In the last seven years, the area has added 99,000 new jobs, with 30 of them are in tech, contributing to a construction boom14. Since then, Amazon has experienced15 an influx of high-skilled, majority-white tech workers. According to the Washington Technology Industry Association, there are now 250,000 people working in tech jobs in Washington, a number thats growing at about 10 annually. Nearly 90 of those jobs are in King County, Seattle, the home of Amazons campus. Seattle is also now the second-highest-paying city in tech16, with an average salary of 99,400, according to the tech recruiting company Dice Holdings. Somewhat unsurprisingly, the growth has made Seattles housing less affordable for some longtime residents, who have accused17 Amazon of perpetuating income inequality in the city. From 2005 to 2015, Seattles median rent went from 1,008 to 1,28618, an increase nearly three times the national median. Recent data shows19 Seattles median home price hit 730,000 in mid-2017, up nearly 17 from a year ago. As Bloomberg notes20, the expansion of the tech industry most notably Amazon has also clogged roadways in the city. Seattle drivers spent an average of 55 hours in traffic in 2016, placing it among the top 10 worst US cities for congestion, according to the most recent analysis21 by Inrix. In June, King County Metro even added more buses22 to accommodate Amazons summer interns. In The Seattle Times, columnist Danny Westneat warned23 Amazons next, Other North American City of all these issues If theres one thing we know in Seattle, its boom and bust. Weve gone from billboards urging the last one leaving to turn out the lights24 to now, our first million-dollar neighborhood25. Both the rush, and the relapse, of the fast buck are in our civic DNA, he wrote. So heads up, Other North American City Amazon is about to detonate a prosperity bomb in your town. Amazon has recently tried to temper this image. In May, it announced26 efforts to house 200 local homeless people in one of its new Seattle buildings. Two months earlier, Bezos gave27 35 million to Seattles Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, in addition to earlier gifts of 30 million. And in 2016, Amazon donated28 10 million toward a new University of Washington computer science and engineering building. Its not yet clear where Amazon will make its new home. The company plans to announce a decision in 2018, and start construction by 2019. Ideally, the company said the city would have at least 1 million people, an international airport, and a stable and business-friendly environment.NOW WATCH Fired Google engineer says his memo actually empowered women29See Also You should never store important documents in the dishwasher during a hurricane  heres what to do instead30Amazon is opening a new 5 billion headquarters in a mystery location  and it could transform the chosen city317 insane facts that reveal how big Amazon has become32 SEE ALSO The 10 spots in the US that are most prepared for disaster33  1 chicago-illinois-1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33",homeless

About Lambert StretherReaders, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism Because markets. I dont much care about the ism that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I dont much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue  and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me  is the tens of thousands of excess deaths from despair, as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics  even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clintons wars created  bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow  currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press  a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed lets call such voices the left. Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isnt allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since Ive been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 38utm_mediumsocial990952  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42 38ref_srctwsrc5Etfw  43 38ref_srctwsrc5Etfw  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60 522378856e76  61  62  63  64  65  66  67  68  69  70  71 38pgPA5amp38lpgPA5amp38dq22ImtravelingE28094andIwakeupsuddenlyinthesilencebeforedawn22amp38sourceblamp38otsozcoOF2sH7amp38sigACfU3U0yTSIroy5BGjrJef5ltx5cB9KpzQamp38hlenamp38saXamp38ved2ahUKEwibz7bRi8XrAhUIVN8KHXlDAnQQ6AEwCXoECAkQAQvonepageamp38q22Im20travelingE28094and20I20wake20up20suddenly20in20the20silence20before20dawn22amp38ffalse  72  73  74  75  76  77  78  79",homeless
portland,Making American Schools Less Great Again,2019-04-19T00:00:00Z,Naked Capitalism,The Oregonian,"Belle Chesler, a visual arts teacher in Beaverton, Oregon. Originally published at TomDispatch1 Three weeks ago, I sat in a cramped conference room in the large public high school where I teach in Beaverton, Oregon. I was listening to the principal deliver a scripted PowerPoint presentation on the 35-million-dollar budget deficit our district faces in the upcoming school year. Teachers and staff members slumped in chairs. A thick funk of disappointment, resignation, hopelessness, and simmering anger clung to us. After all, weve been here before. We know the drill expect layoffs, ballooning class sizes, diminished instructional time, and not enough resources. Accept that the teacher-student relationship  one that has the potential to be productive and sometimes even transformative  will become, at best, transactional. Bodies will be crammed into too-small spaces, resources will dwindle, and learning will suffer. These budgetary crises are by now cyclical and completely familiar. Yet the thought of weathering another of them is devastating. This is the third time in my 14-year-career as a visual arts teacher that weve faced the upheaval, disruption, and chaos of just such a budget crisis. In 2012, the district experienced a massive shortfall that resulted in the firing of 344 teachers and bloated class sizes for those of us who were left. At one point, my Drawing I classroom studio  built to fit a maximum of 35 students  had more than 50 of them stuffed into it. We didnt have enough chairs, tables, or spaces to draw, so we worked in the halls. During that semester I taught six separate classes and was responsible for more than 250 students. Despite the pretense that real instruction was taking place, teachers like me were largely engaged in crowd management and little more. All of the meaningful parts of the job  connecting with students, providing one-on-one support, helping struggling class members to make social and intellectual breakthroughs, not to speak of creating a healthy classroom community  simply fell by the wayside. I couldnt remember my students names, was unable to keep up with the usual grading and assessments were supposed to do, and was overwhelmed by stress and anxiety. Worst of all, I was unable to provide the emotional support I normally try to give my students. I couldnt listen because there wasnt time. On the drive to work, I was paralyzed by dread on the drive home, cowed by feelings of failure. The experience of that year was demoralizing and humiliating. My love for my students, my passion for the subjects I teach, and ultimately my professional identity were all stripped from me. And what was lost for the students? Quality instruction and adult mentorship, as well as access to vital resources  not to mention a loss of faith in one of Americas supposedly bedrock institutions, the public school. And keep in mind that whats happening in my school and in Oregons schools more generally is anything but unique. According to the American Federation of Teachers, divestment2 in education is occurring in every single state in the nation, with 25 states spending less on education than they did before the recession of 2008. The refusal of individual states to prioritize spending on education coupled with the Trump administrations proposed3 7 billion in cuts to the Department of Education are already beginning to make the situation in our nations public schools untenable  for both students and teachers. Sitting in that conference room, listening to my capable and dedicated boss describe our potential return to a distorted reality I remembered well made me recoil. Bracing myself for the soul-crushing grind of trying to convince students to buy into a system that will almost by definition fail to address, no less meet, their needs  to get them to show up each day even though there arent enough seats, supplies, or teachers to do the job  is an exercise in futility. The truth of the matter is that a society that refuses to adequately invest in the education of its children is refusing to invest in the future. Think of it as nihilism on a grand scale. Teachers as First Responders Schools are loud, vital, chaotic places, unlike any other public space in America. Comprehensive public high schools reflect the socioeconomic, racial, religious, and cultural makeup of the population they serve. Each school has its own particular culture and ecosystem of rules, structures, core beliefs, and values. Each also has its own set of problems, specific to the population that walks through its doors each day. Coping with the complexity and magnitude of those problems makes the job of creating a thriving, equitable4, and productive space for learning something akin to magical thinking. The reflexive blame now regularly heaped on schools, teachers, and students in this country is a misrepresentation of reality. The real reason we are being left behind5 our global peers when it comes to student achievement has to do with so much more than the failure to perform well on standardized tests. Our kids are struggling not because weve forgotten how to teach them or theyve forgotten how to learn, but because the adults who run this society have largely decided that their collective future is not a priority. In reality, the tattered and rapidly deteriorating6 infrastructure of our national system of social services leaves schools and teachers as front-line first responders in what Id call a national crisis of the soul. So its no surprise to me that teachers, even in the reddest of states, have been walking out7 of their classrooms and demanding change. Such walkouts in Arizona, California, Colorado, Kentucky, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Washington, and West Virginia have reflected grievances more all-encompassing than the pleas for higher pay that have made the headlines. And in so many states, they are still being paid less8 than a living wage. Demands for just compensation are symbolic and easy for the public to grasp. The higher pay won through some of those walkouts represents an acknowledgement that teachers are being asked to do a seemingly impossible job in a society whose priorities are increasingly out of whack, amid the crumbling infrastructure of the public-school system itself. idea that the real world is somehow separate from the world inside our schools and that issues of inequality, poverty, mental health, addiction, and racism wont impact the capacity of our students to thrive9 academically sets a dangerous precedent for measuring success. Assuming that the student living in a car, not a home, should be able to stay awake during a lecture, that the one returning from a week in a psychiatric ward should be able to instantly tackle a difficult math test, and that the one whose undocumented father was just picked up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers should have no problem concentrating as her teacher diagrams sentences in English is a grand delusion. In fact, among the many demands of teachers and their unions during the strikes of the past year were calls10 for more financial support for comprehensive social services for students. In Los Angeles, teachers fought for legal support11 for students in danger of deportation. In North Carolina, teachers are planning a new round of strikes that will, among other things, demand Medicaid coverage expansion12 aimed at improving student health. In Chicago, teachers included a call for affordable housing13 in their negotiations and so drew attention to the importance of supporting students both in and out of the classroom. If schools are expected to pick up the slack for the gaping holes in our social safety net, it follows that they should be designed and funded with that purpose in mind. If teachers are supposed not only to teach but to act as counselors, therapists, and social workers, they should be paid salaries that reflect such weighty demands and should have access to resources that support such work. Why Prioritizing School Funding Matters There is a large disconnect14 between the lip service paid to supporting public schools and teachers and a visible reticence to adequately fund them. Ask almost anyone  save Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos15  if they support teachers and schools and the answer is probably yes. Bring up the question of how to actually provide adequate financial support for education, however, and youll quickly find yourself mired in arguments about wasteful school spending, pension funds that drain resources, sub-par teachers, and bureaucratic bloat, as well as claims that you cant just continue to throw money at a problem, that money is not the solution. Id argue that money certainly is part of the solution. In a capitalist society, money represents value and power. In America, when you put money into something, you give it meaning. Students are more than capable of grasping that when school funding is being cut, its because we as a society have decided that investing in public education doesnt carry enough value or meaning. The prioritization16 of spending on the military, as well as the emphasis of the Trump administration and congressional Republicans on a staggering tax cut17 for the rich, corporate tax evasion18, and the dismantling of whats left of the social safety net couldnt send a louder message about how much of a priority the wellbeing of the majority of this nations kids actually is. The 2019 federal budget invested19 716 billion in national security, 686 billion of which has been earmarked for the Department of Defense with even more staggering20 figures expected next year. Compare that to the 59.9 billion in discretionary appropriations for the Department ofEducation and the expected future cuts to its budget. Point made, no? However, since federal school contributions add up to only a small percentage of local and state education budgets, all blame cant go there. In Oregon, for instance, restrictions21 placed on property taxes in the 1990s artificially limited such revenue, forcing the state to start relying heavily on income taxes to keep schools afloat. Corporations are an important source of income for states. Yet, though corporate profits in the U.S. rose by 69.3 billion to an all-time high22 of more than two trillion dollars in the third quarter of 2018, over the last 40 years the states share of income-tax revenue has fallen to half what it was in the 1970s. Take Nike, whose worldwide headquarters are located only a few miles from the high school where I teach. It stands as a shining example23 of a corporation that has profited handsomely from sheltering income abroad24 while evading local tax responsibilities. Nike has a special relationship with the state of Oregon, which taxes only the companys local profits, not those earned elsewhere. Adding insult to injury, according to The Oregonian, by the end of 2017, Nike had put 12.2 billion of its earnings into offshore tax shelters25. Had that money been repatriated, the company could have owed up to 4.1 billion in U.S. taxes, which means it has a modest hand in the monetary shortfalls that leave schools like mine in desperate straits. In reality, Oregons economy is thriving26 and yet how little it all matters, since here we are again on the precipice of another crisis. In 1999, the state government formed a committee made up of educators, legislators, business leaders, and parents to create a reliable budgetary tool that would correlate school funding needs with student performance. This Quality Education Model set out a standard for what a quality education would look like for every student in Oregon. In the 20 years since then, the state legislature has reliably failed to meet the funding goals set out by that model. This year, it calls for 10.7 billion in education spending, while the state legislatures joint ways and means committee recently released a budget27 that included spending of just 8.87 billion on the school system. Such annual shortages of funds have, over time, helped create the present gaping hole in our public education system. And each year that hole grows larger. Restoring Faith in Our Nations Institutions Public schools represent one of the bedrock institutions of American democracy. Yet as a society weve stood aside as the very institutions that actually made America great were gutted and undermined by short-term thinking, corporate greed, and unconscionable disrespect for our collective future. The truth is that there is money for education, for schools, for teachers, and for students. We just dont choose to prioritize education spending and so send a loud-and-clear message to students that education doesnt truly matter. And when you essentially defund education for more than 40 years, you leave kids with ever less faith28 in American institutions, which is a genuine tragedy. On May 8th, educators across the state of Oregon are planning to walk out of schools. The action, a precursor to a strike, is a direct response to the inadequate funding in the upcoming state budget and a referendum on the continuing divestment in public education. Teachers like me will be stepping out of our classrooms not because we dont want to teach, but because we do.

portland,"08/15 Links: I grew up with anti-Semitism in the UAE . Peace with Israel is a dream come true; Iran , Turkey , Ben Rhodes, Tlaib united in criticism of UAE - Israel deal; Don't Let Iran Blow Up the U.N. Security Council",2020-08-16T00:00:00Z,Elder of Ziyon,The Oregonian,"Of course, I didnt know what that actually was at the time.Calling Israel and its Jewish inhabitants the enemy of Islam and God was as common as breathing while I was growing up. Anti-Semitism was in my home. It was in the school hallways and yard. You heard it at the caf while having a hookah, enjoying a chicken shawarma and playing a hand of tarneeb.At Friday prayers, a religious cleric at any given mosque was sure to make a comment about how Allah will one day destroy Israel from the map and all the yahoud that live in it so that our brothers may finally be free.Believing in conspiracies like the idea that Israel was the true mastermind behind 911 or that Israel is funding ISIS was prevalent, mainstream, part of the culture. It was a hate taught and passed down through generations by people who had never once interacted with a Jew.Its so weird looking back at it now, trying to understand how it is that I had this hate in my heart for an entire group of people I had never met.I myself didnt meet a Jewish person until I was about 25 years old and traveling through New York. He also happened to be an Israeli.Im not going to lie I was nervous when he first told me where he was from. I didnt know how to feel about, if I was supposed to walk away, or punch him in the face.But something came over me, a curiosity, a deep desire to know more about this person I was taught to just hate. We talked about a wide range of topics in the short time we spent together, but the one that interested me the most was Israel.You could tell he loved his country there was a glow about him when talking about his favorite bakery that he would go to on the marina, or how he enjoys his chicken shawarma with pickles and garlic paste  just the way I would eat it as a kid in the UAE. From my interview on WIONews2 on why peace agreement between Israel3 amp38 UAE4 is so historic!I should add, as India5 has important strategic relations with all 3 countries - - they can have crucial role to play in advancing this peace process! V8Vy5bg7wC6  Arsen Ostrovsky Ostrov_A August 14, 20207 Vivian Bercovici A Dream of Peace Made Real8 To say that Israel is reeling today is a cosmic understatement.All of Israel-left, right, center-was dealt a knockout blow by the indefatigable Netanyahu on Thursday when the Oval Office announced on Thursday the agreement between Israel and the UAE to immediately formalize full normalization of diplomatic, economic and all relations.The revelation was so surreal, in fact, that in this hopelessly gossipy nation, where everything leaks, nothing did. It was the equivalent of an atomic bomb. In terms of sheer force, not devastation. A good atomic bomb.For the Emiratis to engage openly, fully, and proudly has left this nation stunned. In the best way. It was totally unexpected.Perhaps it was best expressed in a tweet by former MK Einat Wilf, who wrote Israeli Jews are keenly aware of their minority status in an Arab and Islamic region and so yearn for peace with the Arab and Islamic world. The UAE showed today yet again that when the Arab world comes to us with offers of genuine peace, they always find in us willing partners.Mired in an evergreen domestic political morass, PM Netanyahu, the magician, has clearly worked for years to pull off the impossible, as he was sliced and diced six ways to Sunday by local scandal and subterfuge.Full normalization.Peace, in the vernacular. With one of the most important, progressive, influential Middle Eastern countries, the UAE.Israeli media reports that this agreement has been brokered by Jared Kushner, Mossad Chief Yossi Cohen, and others. But foremost, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed, ruler of the UAE, has boldly led the Middle East into what will not just re-align the regions geopolitics, but quite likely those of the world. And, in a flash, the notoriously aggressive Israeli media was rocked back on its heels, collective mouths agape, at the unsurpassed brilliance of Bibi.If Shakespeare were alive, he would have to reinvent his canon, which has become the literary foundation of Western story-telling. With Bibi, there simply is no Act V-no denouement. We are stuck in Act III, where the hero is unstoppable. Where his brilliance and unsurpassed triumphs continue, mere human frailties notwithstanding. On regional strategy, this shows the benefit of the U.S. standing by its historic allies in the Middle East. Pres Obama shunned Israel amp38 the Gulf states and sought to normalize Iran. His nuclear deal, an economic boon to Tehran, was a means to that end.  Nikki Haley NikkiHaley August 15, 202010 .commediaEfY_CEYWoAEDlJI?formatjpgamp38namesmall David Horovitz Taking normalization over annexation, Netanyahu poised to enter exalted company11 Unlike Israels two previous peace deals, the agreement announced Thursday with the United Arab Emirates does not remove from the regional equation a direct neighbor with a history of involvement in wars intended to achieve our destruction. It does not feature a large, populous or especially militarily potent adversary.But its significance is profound nonetheless, and it was legitimate for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, detailing the agreement to Israelis on Thursday night, to add himself, at least in pencil, to the short list of Israeli prime ministers who have widened Israels circle of peace Begin 1979, Egypt, Rabin 1994, Jordan, Netanyahu 2020, the United Arab Emirates.Characteristically, the prime minister is trying to dance at two weddings. He is hailing the deal he reached with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed for the full normalization of relations while simultaneously insisting that the quid pro quo  that Israel will suspend declaring sovereignty over areas outlined in the Presidents Vision for Peace, as specified in Thursdays joint US, Israel, UAE statement  has no long-term significance. Extending sovereignty to the 30 percent of the West Bank allocated to Israel under the Trump administrations January peace plan remains on the table, Netanyahu said. President Donald Trump had merely requested a temporary halt to the move as part of the UAE deal, he added. There is no change in my plan Im the one who put it on the table I did not take sovereignty off the table, he repeated, with the aggrieved insistence of one who doth protest too much, methinks. US President Donald Trump shakes hands with Abu Dhabis crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, in the White House in Washington, May 15, 2017. APAndrew Harnik, FileThe American president himself rather punctured the contention, telling his own press briefing, when asked about Netanyahus unilateral annexation plan, that Israel has agreed not to do that. More than just off the table, theyve agreed not to do it, and I think that was very important and I think it was a great concession by Israel This, before he and Ambassador to Israel David Friedman returned to the specific formulation of the deal and stressed that the word suspend was the order of the day. I cant talk about some time in the future, Trump wound up saying.And, indeed, who can?But the bottom line is that annexation is off, and normalization is on.Netanyahu is naturally trying to mitigate the damage this simple equation does to his pro-settlement base. Yet the fact is that the prime minister had a choice  applying sovereignty to parts of Biblical Judea and Samaria at the price of alienating Israels allies and empowering its enemies or jettisoning that unilateral gambit and working with the US administration to bolster regional acceptance of the Jewish state.He chose the latter. And he should be commended for it.Netanyahu thanks Egypt, Oman, Bahrain for their support of UAE deal12 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday thanked the leaders of Egypt, Oman and Bahrain for their support of the agreement to normalize ties with the UAE.While Israeli newspapers overwhelmingly welcomed the accord, Palestinian media condemned the triple aggression against Palestinian rights, referring to Israel, the Emirates and the deals broker, the United States.In the West Bank city of Nablus, protesters set ablaze posters of the leaders of the three countries.Netanyahu, for his part, thanked Arab supporters of the normalization.I thank Egyptian President al-Sisi, and the governments of Oman and Bahrain, for their support of the historic peace treaty between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, which is expanding the circle of peace and will be good for the entire region, Netanyahu tweeted.Israel has two official peace treaties with Arab states  Egypt, since 1979, and Jordan, signed in 1994.The US administration launched a peace plan for the Middle East in January that would see the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states of the Gulf.The Israeli press said Bahrain or Oman, but also Sudan, could be next. Kushner says Israel-Saudi Arabia normalization is an inevitability13 US President Donald Trumps son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner said on Friday that normalized ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia were inevitable, following the US-brokered agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates the day before.Arab countries that are friendly to Israel welcomed the historic accord, but regional power Saudi Arabia has remained conspicuously silent following its announcement.Saudi Arabia, like Israel and the UAE, shares Iran as a common foe and maintains close ties to Washington.Kushner, who reportedly played a role in brokering the Israel-UAE agreement, said in an interview with CNBC on Friday that Saudi Arabias younger generation admired Israel and sought ties with the Jewish state.They see Israel as almost the Silicon Valley of the Middle East and they want to be connected to it as a trading partner, as a technology partner, as a security partner, Kushner said of young Saudis.The older generations, he said, were still stuck in conflicts of the past, and despite the countrys recent efforts toward modernization, you cant turn around a battleship overnight.Despite the opposition from some of the older generation, Kushner predicted that Thursdays landmark deal would serve as a catalyst for opening ties between Israel and other Arab states, including Saudi Arabia. David Friedman Joe Biden Helped Middle East Peace Deal Only by Being So Hostile14 U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman told Breitbart News Daily on Friday morning that former Vice President Joe Biden had contributed to the peace deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates UAE only by being so hostile.The deal, known as the Abraham Accord, was announced by President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Thursday morning and provides for full normalization for the first time between Israel and a Gulf Arab state. It is expected to lead to similar deals with other Arab states.Even liberal critics of President Trump praised his huge achievement, calling the deal a breakthrough and an earthquake.Biden rushed to take some of the credit The coming together of Israel and Arab states builds on the efforts of multiple administrations to foster a broader Arab-Israeli opening, including the efforts of the Obama-Biden administration to build on the Arab Peace Initiative. I personally spent time with leaders of both Israel and UAE during our administration building the case for cooperation and broader engagement and the benefits it could deliver to both nations, and I am gratified by todays announcement.However, Friedman said, if Biden deserved credit, it was only because the Obama-Biden administration was so hostile to both Israel and the UAE that they realized they had to work together.I think the credit that he Biden deserves is he was  they were so bad and so hostile to both Israel and the Emirates that it caused both of them to commiserate a little bit, which was something that we were able to take advantage of when the president Trump took office, Friedman said.So, to that extent, I think the Obama policy was so terrible that it probably created more of a commonality of interest between Israel and the Emirates.The Iran nuclear deal, in particular, which was enthusiastically pushed by the Obama-Biden administration, was a threat to both Israel and the UAE. EXCLUSIVE I interviewed today the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs of the UAE AnwarGargash15. This was the 1st ever interview of an Emirati official with an Israeli reporter. We spoke about normalization and annexation. All the details soon on axios16. Here is a taste pic.twitter .com5ansnPIFcT17  Barak Ravid BarakRavid August 14, 202018 Normalization with other Arab countries is possible, says Avi Berkowitz19 Normalization between Israel and additional Arab countries is possible, Avi Berkowitz, the White House special representative for international negotiations told The Jerusalem Post.Berkowitz said that he prefers not to name those countries for now.One of the things were proud of is the fact that the entire negotiation between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, didnt leak prior to the president announcing it, he said. And so, while obviously now speculation is going to abound, I would like to try my best to sort of allow the negotiations to take their time and not rush it.Berkowitz, who is part of Jared Kushners peace team, replaced Jason Greenblatt as Middle East envoy last November. He noted that the UAE, Oman and Bahrain - all participated in the Trump administrations rollout of the peace for prosperity in January at the White House, but added that there are other countries that have reached out to us. And weve had extremely positive conversations with them.But peace agreements are extraordinarily difficult, and progress can happen quickly, but it can also happen slowly, he continued. We want to take the time that it is necessary to work through the details and to make sure that we can accomplish a real historic achievement with another country. These things are extremely complex negotiations with numerous discussions constantly ongoing, and so Id really like to allow them to have the space and time.Berkowitz weighed in on negotiations during a pandemic and said that travel has been difficult. Azerbaijan to UAE Four ways you will benefit from peace with Israel20 Abu Dhabis Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayeds decision to normalize ties with Israel was well calculated - a move that was made with the understanding that the technology, geopolitical and religious rewards would far outweigh any risks.This is the first Mideast peace treaty in 26 years, but it is not unprecedented for a Muslim-majority country and Israel to enjoy strategic ties. Muslim-majority Azerbaijan and Israel established diplomatic ties in April 1992 that have been developing ever since.Normalization between Israel and the UAE is a historic step towards a future of peace, prosperity and hope, wrote George Deek, Israeli ambassador to Azerbaijan on Twitter on Friday. For nearly 30 years, Azerbaijan has been a model to other Muslim-majority countries, showing what could be achieved through partnership amp38 friendship with Israel.Similarly, wrote Mark Dubowitz, as we celebrate UAE-Israel normalization, remember Azerbaijan was a pioneer in its friendship with Israel. It is an example of what is possible between Muslim-majority countries and Israel. Bakus open relations helped ease the acceptance of Israel in the wider Muslim world.UAE locals hail Israel peace, offer hotel discounts elsewhere in Gulf, wariness21 Two days after the bombshell announcement that the UAE and Israel have agreed to establish full normalized relations, Israels TV news shows Saturday night featured interviews with UAE ministers, locals, Israeli expats, and even a hotel reservations clerk offering 40 discounts to Israeli tourists.All of us in the UAE are celebrating this agreement, welcoming it and encouraging other states to establish agreements like it, an unnamed driver in Dubai enthused in Channel 12s news broadcast. We are happy about this decision by Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed and we support him for anything with Israel, said a local, Jabar bin Shanan.Rival Channel 13, whose correspondent had already made his way to Dubai, interviewed an Israeli-born businessman named Yoni who proclaimed the newly announced establishment of ties to be absolutely amazing. Yonis UAE-born friend Hamdan weighed in, in Hebrew, to say that I started learning Hebrew a while back.Telephoning a Dubai hotel, Channel 12 found a delighted reservations clerk, who said, Everybody is exited about the peace with Israel. And I will be very much looking forward if you come to stay with us. We would be happy to give you a 40 discount from the room rate.Hebrew TV outlets also screened short clips from several pro-Israel bloggers in the Emirates, one of whom wished the countries mazaltov on the new ties. Seth Frantzman Iran, Turkey, Ben Rhodes, Tlaib united in criticism of UAE-Israel deal22 In the US, Rhodes and Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib D-MI were some of the only high-profile voices that appeared critical of the peaceful connection. Rhodes was a standout as one of those who amplified criticism by downplaying the deal.This agreement enshrines what has been the emerging status quo in the region for a long time including the total exclusion of Palestinians, wrote Rhodes. Dressed up as an election eve achievement from two leaders who want Trump to win. The election is several months away. Rhodes also retreated another criticism of the deal which noted it could lead to drone sales.Tlaib was harsher, saying she wouldnt celebrate Netanyahu for stealing land he already controls and slamming devastating apartheid. US Ambassador to Israel David Friedman said Rhodes was wrong about how easy the deal was and noted it had not been accomplished during the previous administration.Rhodes is a frequent critic of both Israel and the UAE. On August 11 he compared Israel to authoritarian regimes such as Russia, Turkey, Hungary, Egypt and Zimbabwe. He frequently calls Israels leadership racist.In January he compared UAE to other countries such as Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, China and Russia and said in September 2018 that the US was outsourcing policy in Yemen to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. He tweeted in August 2019 about the depth of corruption of US policy in the Middle East due to SaudiUAE efforts.He constantly slams the UAE over paid speaking opportunities and influencing US policy, as well as harming the Iran deal. A search of Rhodes tweets show he rarely critiqued Qatar, reserving his criticism for the UAE.Qatars Al-Jazeera network was also at the forefront of attacking the UAE deal. It ran a story on how its ally Turkey might suspend ties with the UAE. Turkey also has relations with Israel. It also ran two op-eds attacking the deal as cementing Israels war on the Palestinians. It claimed Palestinians unanimously rejected the deal. Bill Maher, Pete Buttigieg, Andrew Yang all praise the Trump Administrations historic Israel-UAE dealTheres no question that its good newsA big deal pic.twitter.comTmFWPi6N8K23  Zach Parkinson AZachParkinson August 15, 202024Thomas L. Friedman A Geopolitical Earthquake Just Hit the Mideast25 The big geopolitical losers are Iran and all of its proxies Hezbollah, the Iraqi militias, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the Houthis in Yemen and Turkey. This is for a number of reasons. Up to now, the U.A .E. has kept up a delicate balance between Iran and Israel, not looking to provoke Iran, and dealing with Israel covertly.But this deal is right in Irans face. The tacit message is We now have Israel on our side, so dont mess with us. The vast damage Israel inflicted on Iran through apparent cyberwarfare in recent months may have even given the U.A.E. more breathing room to do this deal.But there is another message, deeper, more psychological. This was the U.A.E. telling the Iranians and all their proxies There are really two coalitions in the region today  those who want to let the future bury the past and those who want to let the past keep burying the future. The U.A.E. is taking the helm of the first, and it is leaving Iran to be the leader of the second.When the Trump administration assassinated Qassim Suleimani, the head of Irans Quds Force, the foreign-operations branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps in January, I wrote a column saying that America had just killed the dumbest man in Iran.Why? Because what was Suleimanis business model, which became Shiite Irans business model? It was to hire Arab and other Shiites to fight Arab Sunnis in Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen and Syria  to project Irans power. And what was the result of all this? Iran has helped to turn all four into failed states. Irans clerical leadership has become the largest facilitator of state failure in the Middle East  including its own  which is why so many Lebanese blame it and Hezbollah for their countrys mismanagement that led to the devastating explosion last week in Beiruts port.I have followed the Middle East for too long to ever write the sentence the region will never be the same again. The forces of sectarianism, tribalism, corruption and anti-pluralism run deep there. But there are other currents  young men and women who are just so tired of the old game, the old fights, the old wounds being stoked over and over again. You could see them demonstrating all over the streets of Beirut last week demanding good governance and a chance to realize their full potential.The U.A.E. and Israel and the U.S. on Thursday showed  at least for one brief shining moment  that the past does not always have to bury the future, that the haters and dividers dont always have to win.It was a breath of fresh air. May it one day soon turn into a howling wind of change that spreads across the whole region. Wow.Here is an Arab Islamic Quran scholar from the UAE using his 1.6m follower count to publicly defend a Jewish IDF Israeli, for protecting the UAE flag. Take heart. Peace is coming   Maajid أبو عمار MaajidNawaz August 15, 202027 Daniel Pipes Feeling Optimistic about Israel and the Emirates28 Third, an unhealthy combination of Israeli land withdrawals and U.S . subsidies drove the diplomacy of prior agreements ignoring the Lebanon deal, which was not implemented. To one extent or another, the deals amounted to grand bribes Recognize Israel and the Americans will reward you. Naturally, the bribees disliked this arrangement its only human to resent taking adverse steps for the money. Washington did not impose the pacts, but critics convincingly claimed it did. A flawed basis caused the agreements either to turn out badly the cold peace with Egypt and Jordan or to fail completely the PLOs continued rejectionism.In contrast, the Israel-UAE-U.S. statement has a legitimate basis, with no hint of bribery Israeli forces retreat from no territory and American taxpayers cough up no money. The statement has a sound premise Jerusalem gives up a widely condemned and counterproductive symbolic step in return for acceptance by an emerging regional power.Yes, the agreement contains lofty language about charting a new path that will unlock the great potential in the region and transforming the region by spurring economic growth, enhancing technological innovation, and forging closer people-to-people relations. Yes, the words Iran, Qatar, Turkey, and Islamism are not overtly mentioned by name, but everyone knows those are the threats. The joint statement relies not on a bribe but on a classic, if implicit, pact of mutual benefit. It also further opens the American arsenal to the Emirates.One of those predictable Palestinian howls of treason.For these reasons, this skeptic of prior Israel-Arab agreements is now uncharacteristically hopeful admittedly, a career-threatening move for a Middle East hand. The UAE-Israel statement helps the Palestinian Authority, enjoys widespread support, meets with limited domestic opposition, has a sound, non-bribery basis, and contains positive features crucial to both parties. If my unwonted optimism is correct, Arab-Israeli relations just might begin to exit from the sterile futility of the past seventy-plus years.Dem Senate Hopefuls Mum on Historic Israel-U.A.E. Peace Deal29 Democratic Senate hopefuls are remaining silent about the Trump administrations Thursday announcement that it had brokered a historic peace agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, an indication of the manner in which the issue has split progressive and mainstream Democrats.Nearly all of 2020s top Democratic Senate challengers avoided making public statements about the agreement, which formally normalizes relations between the Arab nation and Israel. The U.A.E. is the first Gulf Arab nation to increase its relations with Israel, a move that sent shockwaves through the region and sparked anger from Palestinian leaders.In the United States, the announcement was met with ambivalence by former Obama administration officials and outright hostility from Israels top critics in Congress. Rep. Rashida Tlaib D., Mich., a frequent Israel critic who has been accused of spreading anti-Semitic rhetoric, said she wont be fooled by an agreement that she described as a sweetheart business deal.The announcement puts Democrats in a tricky political position While mainstream Democrats have advocated regional peace with Israel for years, they are hesitant to give President Donald Trump a win. Since Trump assumed office, the Democratic Party has argued that he is an irritant to global security. Yet the historic peace agreement between Israel and the U.A.E. shows that, behind the scenes, the administration has been working to broker an accord that will ultimately increase stability in the Middle East.Among candidates for seats in states expected to determine Senate control next year, only Arizonas Mark Kelly has addressed the agreement, calling it an important, positive step forward for our ally, Israel, and for lasting peace in the region. Democratic Senate nominees in Colorado, Iowa, Maine, Montana, and North Carolina have yet to acknowledge the deal following President Donald Trumps Thursday-morning announcement. None of the candidates responded to requests for comment from the Washington Free Beacon.MEMRI Reactions To Israel-UAE Normalization Agreement Senior Saudi Journalist Praises It, Qatari Press Vehemently Attacks It 30 The announcement of a normalization agreement between Israel and the UAE, in advance of the signing of an Israel-UAE peace agreement, sparked many reactions across the Arab world. Senior Saudi journalist Mishari Al-Dhaidi wrote in his August 14 column in the London-based Saudi daily Al-Sharq Al-Awsat that the agreement was an historic diplomatic achievement and compared it to the peace agreements with Israel by Egyptian president Anwar Sadat and Jordans King Hussein. In contrast, the Qatari press, as expected, vehemently attacked the agreement, including with invective against the UAE and accusations that it had betrayed and sold out the Palestinian cause and gotten nothing in return. Qatari journalists also tweeted messages attacking it and UAE leader Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Muhammad bin Zayed personally, calling him a liar and the Satan of the Arabs, and claiming that with this agreement he had left the fold of Islam. Some even called on the Arab countries to boycott the UAE and recall their ambassadors from it.The following are translations of Al-Dhaidis column praising the agreement and Qatari attacks on it.Saudi Journalist The UAE-Israel Agreement Is A Breakthrough That Will Benefit The Arabs And PalestiniansIn his August 14, 2020 column in the London-based Saudi daily Al-Sharq Al-Awsat, Mishari Al-Dhaidi wrote To put it directly and clearly, the UAE achieved a great political, psychological and security breakthrough in the Middle East when the historic agreement with Israel was announced. This agreement does not disregard the justified right of the Palestinians to establish their state and protect the Islamic holy places for all Muslims. Rather, it provides a feasible opportunity to implement the two-state solution in practice.The UAE has made a tangible achievement on the Palestinian front  through action, not slogans  by stopping the erosion of the Palestinian lands in the West Bank in favor of Israeli settlements, an issue that was explicitly stated in the tripartite announcement by the UAE, the U.S. and Israel. Turkey, Qatar, Iran and all the rest of the big talkers, and obviously also the organizations of chaos, such as Al-Qaeda, ISIS, the Houthis and Hizbullah, will continue operating their word-mill against the UAE, for this word-mill never stopped churning out invective and against this noble, strong and tranquil Arab country Egypts historic leader, president Anwar Sadat, was attacked when he protected his country from a dire fate and from the loss of its territories by signing the Camp David Accords. He was a true hero of war and of peace, for Egypt still enjoys the benefits of the peace he made with Israel. Later, the great Jordanian king, Hussein bin Tallal, was attacked when he refused to succumb to the market of populist slogans and brought his country peace while also restoring its territories as part of the famous Wadi Araba peace agreement. Being a realistic and responsible Arab leader, Egyptian President Abd Al-Fattah Al-Sisi welcomed the agreement between the UAE and Israel, achieved under the aegis of the U.S. and its president Trump. The absurd thing is that the propaganda machine of the Muslim Brotherhood, Turkey and Iran is shooting its arrows at the UAE, while Turkeys trade, military and tourism relations with Israel continue unabated. Qatar, the shop where Al-Jazeera hocks its wares, is also friendly with Tel-Aviv and coordinates with it! Khaled Abu Toameh Saudi, Emirati analysts Palestinians will benefit from accord31 Abd al-Aziz bin Razen, a prominent Saudi academic and researcher, defended the normalization agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates on Saturday, saying it pulled the rug from under the feet of Turkey and Iran and turned the Palestinians into the biggest winners.In an article published in the Saudi al-Khaleeg online newspaper, Razen wrote that the agreement was not a blank check, but rather the goal was to protect the rights of the Palestinian people who have been abandoned by Hamas and thrown into the arms of Iran.The UAE is sovereign and has the right to do what its political and security interests dictate, Razen argued. It initiated this agreement after 72 years of the Arab-Israeli conflict to protect Islamic sanctities. One of the conditions of the agreement is to allow Muslims around the world to pray at the blessed al-Aqsa Mosque.The Saudi academic noted that the Israel-UAE deal was not the first of its kind. It was preceded by several agreements such as the Israel-Egypt Camp David agreement, the 1991 Madrid Peace Conference, the 1993 Oslo Accords between the PLO and Israel that resulted in the establishment of the Palestinian Authority, as well as the 1994 Wadi Araba Agreement between Israel and Jordan, Razen pointed out.The UAE, he added, is trying to put an end to the era of denunciation and condemnation by taking this step to serve the defenseless Palestinian people. It threw the ball into the court of the Palestinians, who must now seize the opportunity and abandon the policy of lip service.Iran UAE made huge mistake with Israel deal, and now faces dangerous future32 The United Arab Emirates made a huge mistake by taking steps toward normalization with Israel, Irans President Hassan Rouhani said in a televised speech on Saturday.For its part, Irans powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps vowed there would be dangerous consequences for the UAE, and that the deal was accelerate Israels demise. The IRGC, designated a terrorist organization by the US, called the deal a shameful agreement and an evil action that was underwritten by the US, and said it would bring a dangerous future for the Emirati government.Rouhani additionally warned the UAE against allowing Israel to have a foothold in the region, the Reuters news agency reported.The UAE better be mindful. They have committed a huge mistake, a treacherous act. We hope they will realize this and abandon this wrong path, Rouhani said.Iran has historically been the protector of its neighbors and ensurer of the security of the Persian Gulf, Rouhani said, noting the Emirates apparently thought the agreement could help guarantee security. Nasrallah UAE betrayed Arabism, did Trump a personal favor, with Israel deal33 Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah warned Israel on Friday that his organization intended to carry out a game changing revenge attack for the death of one of its fighters in an airstrike last month that was widely attributed to Israel.He also called the new UAE-Israel normalization deal a betrayal of Arabism, and said the UAE had given a personal electoral favor to US President Donald Trump.Israel had been on high alert along the northern border, but slightly reduced its troop presence following the deadly explosions that rocked Beirut last week, killing some 200 people, injuring thousands, and leaving nearly a third of a million people homeless.Everything that happened since July until today, the high alert of the Israeli military and more is our punishment to Israel, Nasrallah said in a televised speech commemorating the anniversary of the end of the bloody 2006 conflict between Israel and the Iran-backed terror group. If you kill us, you need to wait across the border for the reaction. This is a decision that is still in force, nothing has changed it is just a question of time.Nasrallah warned that Hezbollahs reaction will redefine the rules of the game along the border, adding that only a considered, serious reaction, not some public relations stunt, can do this.In his speech, which came hours after he was reported to have met with visiting Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, Nasrallah also condemned the normalization agreement announced Thursday between Israel and the United Arab Emirates.This is a betrayal of Islam and Arabism, it is a betrayal of Jerusalem, of the Palestinian people, Nasrallah said. Irans president says Emirates made huge mistake in Israel deal34 The United Arab Emirates has made a huge mistake in reaching a deal toward normalizing ties with Israel, Irans President Hassan Rouhani said on Saturday in a speech furiously condemning what he called a betrayal by the Gulf state.The Iranian hardline daily Kayhan, whose editor-in-chief is appointed by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said the UAE has turned itself into a legitimate target for the resistance, according to its website.The UAE-Israel agreement announced on Thursday, which U.S. President Donald Trump helped to broker, is seen as aimed at bolstering opposition to regional power Iran.In his televised speech, Rouhani warned the UAE against allowing Israel a foothold in the region.They the UAE better be mindful. They have committed a huge mistake, a treacherous act. We hope they will realize this and abandon this wrong path, Rouhani said without elaborating.In a front-page comment, the newspaper Kayhan said The UAEs great betrayal of the Palestinian people ..., will turn this small, rich country which is heavily dependent on security into a legitimate and easy target for the resistance.Iran often refers to militant forces and regional countries opposed to Israel and the United States as a resistance front.Erdogan Turkey may suspend ties with UAE over Israel deal35 President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday that Turkey was considering closing its embassy in Abu Dhabi and suspending diplomatic ties with the United Arab Emirates over its accord to normalize ties with Israel.Erdogan was speaking to reporters in Istanbul after the Turkish Foreign Ministry said history will never forgive the hypocritical behavior of the UAE in agreeing such a deal.The Foreign Ministry said the Palestinian people and administration were right to react strongly against the agreement, which recasts the order of Middle East politics from the Palestinian issue to the fight against Iran.History and the conscience of the regions peoples will not forget and never forgive this hypocritical behavior of the UAE, betraying the Palestinian cause for the sake of its narrow interests, the ministry said in a statement.It is extremely worrying that the UAE should, with a unilateral action, try and do away with the 2002 Arab Peace Plan developed by the Arab League. It is not in the slightest credible that this three-way declaration should be presented as supporting the Palestinian cause. Where Luxembourg36 FM Asselborn just reveals it was never pursuing peace he was motivated by, but sheer hatred against Israel37. The peace deal with UAE38 should be great source of celebration ... but seemingly not for this bitter little man.

It reiterated That it holds Hamas responsible for all acts in and emanating from the Strip.On Saturday, Hamas warned of a dangerous escalation after two children were reportedly lightly injured in the Israeli strikes.Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum claimed Fridays strikes hit innocent civilians and that they constituted a red line and a dangerous escalation for which Israel will bear the consequences.Israel strikes Hamas in Gaza for 4th straight night in response to arson attacks43 Israel launched airstrikes against Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip for the fourth night in a row late Friday in response to a spate of attacks using balloon-borne arson and explosive devices sent from the Strip into Israel in recent days.The overnight attack on sites used by Hamas, the Islamist terror group that rules the enclave, was the fifth such operation since the start of the week.The Israel Defense Forces said in a statement that combat helicopters and tanks hit a number of terror targets belonging to Hamas, including sites used by its naval forces, underground infrastructure and observation posts.The attack was carried out in response to balloons with explosives and incendiary balloons launched from the Gaza Strip into Israeli territory over the past week, the IDF said.The IDF added that it holds Hamas responsible for all acts in and emanating from the Strip.There have been no reports of casualties in the latest bout of violence in the south.Makeshift firebombs attached to bunches of balloons or kites ignited over 100 fires in Israel in the past week, setting alight agricultural fields and brush. Officials said most were small fires, but some caused damage. Maybe her son, AhmadErekat44 shouldnt have tried to murder a group of Jews, by ramming his vehicle into them?

While Hamas has been proscribed as a terrorist organization by the United States, Canada and the European Union and has had its armed wing banned in the UK, Turkey argues that it is a legitimate organization that was democratically elected, in reference to the 2006 Palestinian legislative elections and violent removal of Fatah members from the Gaza Strip in 2007.A senior source told The Telegraph that the Hamas operatives are not foot soldiers but the most senior Hamas operatives outside of Gaza. They are actively raising funds and directing operatives to carry out attacks in the present day.The Turkish Government gave in to pressure by Hamas to grant citizenship to its operatives, thereby allowing them to travel more freely, endangering other countries that have listed Hamas as a terror group, the source added.

Security Council53 The precedent governing the Security Council dictates that the United States wins, because a preliminary vote must be held to decide whether a matter is procedural or substantive. That preliminary vote is subject to the permanent member veto, meaning the United States could veto a motion by Russia and China to rule their question procedural. The underlying motion then becomes substantive, meaning it too is subject to a U.S. veto. This is known as the double veto power of a permanent member. It is the ace in the hole for each of the P5and though it has not been employed for decades, this is a paradigm case for its proper use.Refusing to hold the preliminary vote, or denying the United States right to use its veto in that vote, would not only violate 75 years of Security Council precedent, it would forever change the Security Council. No longer would a permanent members veto be absolute instead, it would be subject to consensus opinion. The United States might be the victim of such a coup in 2020, but Russia, China, the United Kingdom, and France would all find their vetoes up for debate in the months and years to come.With such a new reality, U.S. leaders might rethink the utility of the Security Council. Skepticism of the U.N. system is already at an all-time high within the Republican Party, yet if Russia and China increasingly get their way, Democrats, too, may come to see the council as a liability, not an asset. Calls for the United States withdrawal from the United Nations might become mainstream. Withdrawal is not likely to be a priority if former Vice President Joe Biden is elected president. But what about four years later if former Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Sen. Tom Cotton, or Sen. Ted Cruz is elected?So now it is time for London and Paris to take a deep breath and evaluate the magnitude of the diplomatic decision before them. Johnson and Macron can still avoid a diplomatic showdown at the Turtle Bay Corral. They could opt to trigger the snapback themselves, a logical step seven months after initiating the JCPOAs dispute resolution process with nothing to show for it. If theyd rather oppose snapback and maintain support for the JCPOA until the very end, UNSCR 2231 gives them the tools to do that, too. Either country could introduce the resolution to ignore the U.S. complaint and keep the JCPOA alive. While the United States could veto the resolution, France and the United Kingdom would get to save face by voting to keep the nuclear deal and condemning the Americans for killing itall without shredding the permanent member veto and risking the collapse of the United Nations.But if either leader sides with Russia and China against the United States double veto right, they will not only shoulder the blame for the arms embargo on Iran expiring, but will also bear the responsibility for the beginning of the end of modern multilateralism.Iran claims victory after UN soundly rejects US bid to extend arms embargo54 Iran on Saturday hailed a UN Security Council vote rejecting a US bid to extend an arms embargo on the Islamic republic, saying its foe has never been so isolated.President Hassan Rouhani said the United States had failed to kill off what he called the half alive 2015 deal with major powers that gave Iran relief from sanctions in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program.The United States failed in this conspiracy with humiliation, Rouhani told a televised news conference.In my opinion, this day will go down in the history of our Iran and in the history of fighting global arrogance.Only two of the Councils 15 members voted in favor of the US resolution seeking to extend the embargo, highlighting the division between Washington and its European allies since US President Donald Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear accord in May 2018.Washingtons European allies all abstained, and Iran mocked the Trump administration for only winning the support of one other country, the Dominican Republic. Israel Condemns UN Decision Not to Extend Iran Arms Embargo55 The UN Security Councils decision not to extend an arms embargo on Iran will lead to further Middle East instability, Israels foreign minister said on Saturday.The extremist regime in Iran doesnt just finance terrorism it takes an active part in terrorism through its branches around the world and uses it as a political tool. This behavior represents a danger to regional and international stability, Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi said in a statement.

The details of the US seizing the gas on board the tankers was part of an effort by Washington to stop multi-million-dollar fuel shipments to Caracas that violate US sanctions.These actions represent the governments largest-ever seizure of fuel shipments from Iran, the US Justice Department said.The US has vowed to cut Iranian exports of oil and gas to near zero. Iran has a capacity to produce 3.7 million barrels of oil per day and consumes some 1.7 million of them a day. The US has cut Iranian oil exports by 2.7 million barrels a day, Reuters reports on August 20, 2019.But sanctions dont cut everything. A convoy of Iranian vessels was detected near Syrias Baniyas port earlier this year, supposedly carrying some 6.8 million barrels of oil. Groups like Tanker Trackers help track these types of shipments. Iran is also storing some 30 million barrels of oil at sea in a fleet of supertankers, reports indicated in May.This floating storage may have reached 50 million barrels by July. Last July a tanker named Grace 1 was briefly interdicted with 2.1 million barrels on the way to Syria. In retaliation Iran seized a British tanker. Seth Frantzman What were Iranians looking for on the ship Wila?65 US Central Command observed Iranian forces, including two ships and an Iranian Sea King helicopter, board a ship called Wila on August 12. The International Maritime Security Construct IMSC said it had monitored an incident involving Iranian forces who boarded a tanker in the international waters of the Gulf of Oman near the Strait of Hormuz.At the same time, the US revealed it had confiscated a million barrels of Iranian gasoline from four ships heading to Venezuela. Was the Wila incident connected? Samir Madani, co-founder of Tanker Trackers suggests the explanation may be more complex than it appears.Lets start with what we know. Irans use of military forces to board the commercial vessel in international waters constituted a blatant violation of international law, the IMSC said. It now turns out that the Wila did not call for help.Sentinel, which is the Coalition Task Force CTF aspect of the IMSC, said its mission is to deter and expose this malign activity and reassure the maritime community. A coalition ship was providing overwatch during the incident.So what happened with the MT Wila ship? The ship was on the way to Khor Fakkan, a UAE port in the Gulf of Oman. At around 830 p.m. the Coalition warship saw the Iranian Navy SH-3 Sea King helicopter approach and armed men rope down.Could this be Iran hijacking a ship? Iran has done this before. In July 2019 Iran did the same thing with a British tanker. The Gulf Sky ship also disappeared in July off the UAE and ended up off the coast of Iran with the crew claiming they were hijacked.

Repulsive. As always, the far-left meets the far-right when it comes to intolerance, especially antisemitism.The questions about Israel comes at the end of the 12-page questionnaire, which was sent out late last month, The New York Post reported. Do you pledge not to travel to Israel if elected to Cityb Council in solidarity with Palestinians living under occupation, asked the Democratic Socialist, a group that advocates the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions BDS campaign against Israel.The German and Austrian parliaments declared BDS to be an antisemitic movement.The socialist organization asked in its survey to politicians Do you support the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement?

Does the DSA support BDS as a policy plank?Kumar The DSA is in favor of BDS and believes everybody has a right to their home. Obviously in New York City, we dont have that much that were doing around that here, but we have a national organization that focuses on international affairs.So does the DSA support the existence of the State of Israel?Kumar I feel like thats not really relevant to this conversation.Thats a tough stance to back in a country thats still overwhelmingly pro-Israel. But its worth noting that not all progressives feel this way. Ritchie Torres, a progressive being backed by pro-Israel groups who secured the Democratic nomination last month in a Bronx congressional district, did not think the exchange made much sense.The leadership of the DSA declines to affirm that the state of Israel should exist, he said on Twitter.

An Orthodox Jewish man is cycling nearby without wearing a face mask, several of which are seen on the ground around the bus. A speech balloon above the bus driver reads After the zoo, well go tour Coronavirus Village.Richard Kennigsman, a well-known Jewish-Belgian satirist, wrote on Facebook that while he has not called Kroll an anti-Semite, his painting may be considered as such.Joel Rubinfeld, the president of the Belgian League Against Anti-Semitism, said the caricature again shows that Kroll obsessively returns to Jews in his works. The August 7 caricature is subtle in comparison to previous Kroll works, Rubinfeld added, including one of a lavishly dressed Jewish diamond dealer smiling while visiting the tax office amid unhappy and poor visitors.In a 2010 interview for Lavenir, Kroll said he cant stand being accused of anti-Semitism because he isnt anti-Semitic and said he has many Jewish friends.The Orthodox Jewish community of Antwerp has had fewer than 20 deaths from the coronavirus, largely thanks to an early and vigilant adherence to anti-contagion measures. Arabic Newspaper in Canada Falsely Blames Israel for Beirut Explosion82 A Canadian Jewish advocacy group on Friday highlighted the misinformation campaign by an Arabic-language newspaper in Ontario that claimed Israel was to blame for the devastating explosion in Beiruts port area on August 4.In a statement that detailed the false allegation pushed by the Al Meshwar newspaper, Bnai Brith Canada noted that its Aug. 7 edition included a half-page editorial by editor-in-chief Nazih Khatatba titled Who Is Responsible for the Beirut Port Disaster?The group quoted Khatatbas conclusion that the Beirut disaster cannot be anything but the result of a planned Israeli-American act by direct implementation or via their local proxies.The same piece then added that in the event that Israel is responsible for the detonation, Hezbollah can do nothing but respond with attacks at the same level as the crime.Bnai Brith Canada observed, Ironically, Hezbollah itself has told Lebanese media that Israel was not responsible, and its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, did not point the finger at Israel.Group set up by German soccer stars donates 80,000 to Auschwitz museum83 A German organization that two professional soccer players established to fight the coronavirus has donated approximately 80,000 to the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum in Poland.The WeKickCorona Initiative, established this year by Bayern Munich players Leon Goretzka and Joshua Kimmich, gave the money after the museum asked for public contributions in the wake of the pandemic, which has paralyzed tourism.Auschwitz is part of our history and its memory is omnipresent 75 years after the end of the war. We are all challenged to ensure that one of the darkest chapters in human history does not repeat itself. It is a matter close to our hearts to help ensure that the culture of remembrance is upheld even in the corona pandemic, the WeKickCorona Initiative said in a statement.Kimmich and Goretzka, both 25, each play for the German national team as well.More than 1.5 million people, most of them Jews, were murdered at Auschwitz, a concentration and labor camp that the Nazis built in occupied Poland.Pixel inventor, computer scientist Russell Kirsch dies at 9184 Russell Kirsch, a computer scientist credited with inventing the pixel and scanning the worlds first digital photograph, died ust 11 at his home in Portland, Oregon, The Oregonian reported. He was 91.Pixels, the digital dots used to display photos, video and more on phone and computer screens, werent an obvious innovation in 1957, when Kirsch created a small, 2-by-2-inch black-and-white digital image of his son, Walden, as an infant. That was among the first images ever scanned into a computer, using a device created by his research team at the US National Bureau of Standards now the National Institutes of Science and Technology.This work laid the foundations for satellite imagery, CT scans, virtual reality and Facebook, said a 2010 Science News article about Kirsch, subsequently republished by Wired. That first square image, that article said, measured a mere 176 pixels on a side  just shy of 31,000 pixels in total. Today, the digital camera on the iPhone 11 can capture roughly 12 million pixels per image.Though computers have become exponentially more powerful and can now fit in our pockets, science has ever since been coming to terms with the fact that Kirsch made his pixels square. The square shape of the pixels meant that image elements can look blocky, clunky or jagged  just generally not as smooth as real life. Theres even a word for this effect pixelated.Squares was the logical thing to do, Kirsch told the magazine in 2010. Of course, the logical thing was not the only possibility but we used squares.

The surge in fatal opioid overdoses was attributed to the introduction of fentanyl into Oregons unregulated drug supply. Longitudinal studies found no association with Measure 110s implementation. A 2023 study revealed that people using fentanyl were very likely to witness overdoses and administer naloxone.Panel 2 Substance Use Disorder ServicesModerator Christi Hildebran, Vice President of Research and EvaluationComagine Health Senior Research Associate Alexis Cooke presented on the role of peers in expanding services after Measure 110. New certifications for recovery peers have increased with Measure 110 funding - 325 peers were certified in 2020, and 1,269 peers were certified in the first three quarters of 2023.Service gaps persist despite an increase in funding for services, with challenges that include limited access to housing, withdrawal management and residential treatment services.Panel 3 Housing, Harm Reduction and Family ServicesInterviews showed that while many unstable and unhoused Oregonians sought assistance post-Measure 110, only a minority received services. Notably, few people started using drugs after the measure passed, and evidence suggested no migration to Oregon for drug use.Panel 4 Law EnforcementComagine Health Senior Research Associate Danielle Good presented on data from interviews with people who use drugs about law enforcement interactions. Despite reduced drug-related arrests after Measure 110, people who use drugs, especially those who are unhoused, are still heavily policed. Survey data with people who use drugs reveal significant criminal legal engagement after Measure 110.Funded by the Arnold Ventures Foundation, the research shed light on Measure 110s impact, emphasizing the need for ongoing evaluation and targeted interventions to address persisting challenges in Oregons substance use landscape.The recent symposium received national attention as part of an essay in the New York Times, as well as statewide coverage in the Willamette Week.",unhoused

portland,"Daily Media Links 7/24: Millennials at Heart of America 's Free Speech Woes, Expert Tells Judges, San Antonio fire union to sue city over alleged First Amendment violation, and more...",2018-07-24T00:00:00Z,ContentEngine Think Tank Newswire English,Willamette Week,"Second, though the information is supposed to be kept confidential, this has not always been the case. For example, in 2014 the IRS was forced to pay damages to the National Organization for Marriage, which supports traditional marriage, after an employee, whose specific identity was never publicly uncovered, leaked information on NOMs donors to an LGBT rights organization. There is simply no need for the IRS to maintain donor information that might be accidentally released, leaked by a rogue employee, or used by unscrupulous politicians to harass political opponents...Finally, we might ask why, absent a very good reason, the federal government should ever be collecting data on our memberships and donations in the first place. What business of the government is it if you belong to a fishing club or the National Association of Realtors, or want to support Everytown for Gun Safety or the NRA?Free SpeechCourthouse News Service Millennials at Heart of Americas Free Speech Woes, Expert Tells JudgesBy Maria DinzeoJonathan Turley kicked off the Ninth Circuits annual judicial conference Monday by telling a Marriott ballroom full of judges that America has a big free speech problem.Polls indicate that 40 percent of millennials favor speech codes and government sanctions for offensive speech. And what really worries me the most is were losing this coming generation, he said...U.S. Magistrate Judge James Donohue posited that millennials may have lost faith in the system. He pointed to Citizens United v. FEC, a U.S. Supreme Court decision that essentially granted corporations the same free speech rights as people, as a possible cause of generational disillusionment.Millennials are perhaps valuing the rights of free speech less because of the sense that they have little control in light of decisions such as Citizens United. We grew up believing there was a marketplace of ideas and that the answer to bad speech was more speech, Donohue, of the Western District of Washington, said.But theres also this sense a lot of people have that the system is rigged. Congress enacted restrictions on campaign financing to try to even the playing field, and the court dismissed all of the concerns by Congress. And it seems all those concerns are coming true. So theres a lot of disillusion.While Turley said he agreed with the Citizens United decision in terms of free speech, he agreed with Donohues point on disillusionment and corporate involvement in politics.I do think part of the problem were having with millennials is that there is this sense that they are no longer in control of their determination, he said. But there is something much more fundamental with this generation. I think we win them over by convincing them that they can still have a voice.Supreme CourtWashington Post Supreme Court picks remarks on Nixon case open new front in confirmation fightBy Seung Min Kim and Robert BarnesSupreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaughs years-old remarks questioning the landmark ruling that forced President Richard M. Nixon to turn over the Watergate tapes opened a new front in the battle over his confirmation, ensuring his views on executive power will square prominently in Senate hearings.Included in the thousands of pages turned over to the Senate Judiciary Committee this past weekend is a 1999 transcript of a panel discussion in which the future Supreme Court nominee opined whether the tensions of the time led to an erroneous decision in the case United States v. Nixon.Although Kavanaugh has defended the 1974 ruling in other remarks, Democrats have seized on his skepticism from nearly two decades ago to build a key argument against the nominee That he wont be a sufficient check on the president who appointed him...Democrats have also focused on Kavanaughs rulings in favor of broad presidential power and his criticism of the independent counsel law to suggest that he would protect Trump from special counsel Robert S. Mueller IIIs probe. The judge has been outspoken in saying, for instance, that he would put the final nail in the now-defunct independent counsel law.But it is unclear whether Kavanaughs dim view of the independent counsel law extends to separate special-counsel regulations governing Muellers investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Muellers legal battle with Trumps lawyers over his request to interview the president could end up before the Supreme Court.On the Nixon decision, Kavanaughs allies rallied to his defense. They pointed out that he had praised the unanimous ruling in the case - which forced Nixon to turn over the Watergate tapes and ultimately led to his resignation - in other venues, such as a law review article in 1998 and a speech in 2016.The CourtsWashington Examiner Disgraced former New York AG Eric Schneiderman just lost in court in his efforts to persecute pro-lifersBy Becket AdamsA federal judge has ruled that a pro-life group did not harass patients and escorts outside an abortion clinic in Queens, N.Y., rebuking a concerted effort by Schneiderman to frame the demonstrators as violent extremists.U.S. District Judge Carol Bagley Amon also denied a request for an injunction by the state in People v. Griepp et al., arguing that the harassment allegations do not hold up under legal scrutiny...The filed action came after the Schneiderman-run OAG conducted a yearlong undercover investigation that included hidden cameras, female patient decoys, and placing wires on the clinics escorts.Judge Amon responded this weekend in a 103-page opinion saying she could find nothing to back the OAGs specific allegations, dismantling entirely the testimony of the states witnesses as well as the states arguments.The most problematic of the credibility issues discussed ... is the tendency for the Clinic Escort Recaps, Protestor Experience Questionnaires, and OAG witness testimony to exaggerate the impropriety of the defendants conduct and to omit mitigating circumstances, Amon wrote.Though the decision is a victory for the pro-life activists, the federal judge warned that theyre on thin ice.This decision should not embolden the defendants to engage in more aggressive conduct. In a few instances noted, several of the defendants actions came close to crossing the line from activity protected by the First Amendment to conduct prohibited by the New York City Clinic Access Act, she wrote.CongressNBC News Democrats and the GOP finally agree on something How to use PAC loopholes to fund luxury lifestylesBy Adav Noti and Meredith McGeheeThis runaway spending was brought to light in a new report, How Leadership PACs Became Politicians Preferred Ticket to Luxury Living, released on July 20 by our two government reform groups, Campaign Legal Center CLC and Issue One. The report highlights many bipartisan abuses of a source of funds little known beyond the beltway, but widely exploited within it so-called leadership PACs...The kicker Much of this spending would likely be illegal if politicians used their official campaign accounts to pick up the tab. These kinds of expenses cannot be paid with campaign money because campaign donations present a much greater risk of buying access or influence if they are funding the politicians next round of golf, country club membership, clothing purchase, or trip to Disney World.So how are these abuses possible? Because while the Federal Election Commission FEC has long prohibited politicians from spending official campaign funds on personal expenditures, they have failed to apply this personal use prohibition to leadership PACs. And Congress, which has the power to police its own members, has also remained on the sidelines...The FEC should adopt new rules clarifying that the personal use prohibition that already applies to campaign accounts also applies to leadership PACs. This would be an easy step, and the FEC clearly has the authority to take it.For its part, Congress could pass legislation to crack down on leadership PACs, and the ethics committees in the House and Senate could enforce their rules applying a personal use ban to leadership PACs.The Hill Dem senators probe financial links between Butina, NRABy Sylvan LaneDemocratic Sens. Ron Wyden Ore., Bob Menendez N.J. and Sheldon Whitehouse R.I. requested copies of all documents that outline Maria Butinas connections to the NRA in a Monday letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.Butina, a Russian national and gun-rights activist, was arrested and charged last week with secretly acting to advance the Kremlins interests through cultivating connections with powerful groups and individuals close to the Republican Party.Butina is also a former assistant to Alexander Torshin, a deputy governor of the Central Bank of Russia that Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee say potentially funneled Russian money into President Trumps 2016 campaign through the NRA...The senators asked Mnuchin for all records relevant to financial connections between the NRA and Butina, including groups affiliated with the NRA, a pro-gun rights groups Butina opened and a shell corporation Butina created with political operative Paul Erickson.The Democrats also renewed a previous request from Wyden for similar records regarding the NRA and Torshin, who was sanctioned by the Treasury Department for his close relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin...Butina was arrested three days after special counsel Robert Mueller indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers in the 2016 hacking of the Democratic National Committee.Online Speech PlatformsWashington Post On WhatsApp, fake news is fast - and can be fatalBy Elizabeth Dwoskin and Annie GowenAt least two dozen people have been killed in mob lynchings in India since the start of the year, their deaths fueled by rumors that spread on WhatsApp, the Facebook-owned messaging service. In Brazil, messages on WhatsApp falsely claimed a government-mandated yellow-fever vaccine was dangerous, leading people to avoid it. And as Mexico was heading into its presidential election this month, experts there called WhatsApp the ugly underbelly of the countrys news environment, a place where politically misleading stories, memes and messages can spread unchecked...Unlike the largely open forums of Facebook and Twitter, WhatsApp hosts private chats among groups of friends. It is encrypted, or mathematically scrambled, so that no one - not even the services employees - can read the content of messages that were not intended for them...Executives held urgent meetings with political leaders in India last week, and the service is building new technology to promote news literacy. On Thursday, the company announced a major change, limiting the ability to forward messages - a feature that has been blamed for enabling disinformation to go viral.WhatsApps new boss - Chris Daniels, a veteran executive from WhatsApps parent company, Facebook - has vowed to prioritize safety...On his first week on the job in May, Daniels, who declined to be interviewed, assembled WhatsApps 300 employees for a town hall. The commitment to privacy would not change, he told them, but from now on the focus of the service would also include safety - preventing misinformation and the harm it can cause, according to an executive who attended the meeting.FECMcClatchy DC Donations to Nunes improperly used to charter a private jet, says complaint to FECBy Kate IrbyPolitical donations to Rep. Devin Nunes were improperly used to fund 5,518 in private jet travel, says a complaint filed by a nonpartisan watchdog group with the Federal Election Commission on Monday.Nunes, R-Calif., is the sponsor of New PAC, a leadership political action committee which paid 11,036 to Paramount Business Jets on March 7, according to public filings. The PAC was refunded 5,518 May 18, citing overpayment...Its illegal for such leadership PAC money, which members of Congress use for donating money to other political candidates and committees, to be used for non-commercial air travel. Exceptions described in federal law are government-owned planes or planes already owned or leased by the congressman or candidate...Myles Martin, an FEC spokesman, said candidates can use leadership PAC money for chartering private jets in certain cases. It has to be chartered through a company set up for that specific purpose and candidates have to pay the market rate. In those cases, chartering a private jet can fall under commercial air travel according to the FECs interpretation, Martin said.The law concerning this was mainly set up to prevent candidates from using a corporations private jet, or that of a wealthy donor, Martin said, adding leadership PAC complaints are uncommon because candidates get a wide discretion in their use.But Dan Weiner, senior counsel at the nonpartisan Brennan Center and a former senior counsel to an FEC commissioner, said any chartering of private flights by a leadership PAC is a clear illegal use under the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act passed in 2007.HarassmentReason Portland Food Cart Shuts Down Following Harassment by Occupy ICE ProtestersBy Christian BritschgiCo-owned by couple Scott and Julie Hakes, The Happy Camper used to do steady business serving food to the federal agents who worked across the street. The two used the proceeds to help fund their non-profit Off The Grid, which supplies food and clothing to Portlands homeless population.Julie was initially supportive of the Occupy ICE protest when it started, according to comments she made the Willamette Week. But the Hakes attempt to stay neutral and serve all who are hungry, including ICE and other Department of Homeland Security DHS staff who share the Portland office space, provoked anger from some anti-ICE demonstrators, who reportedly threatened staff at the food cart for failing to get on board with the struggle...According to Scott Hakes, the last straw came when protestors threatened his 21-year-old daughter for serving food to a DHS employee. If they catch her outside the cart, theyre going to hurt her. Theyre constantly cussing at her and screaming at her, he told KGW. According to the owners, protestors also threatened to burn down the cart.On July 20, less than a month after protests began, a post went up on the Happy Campers FacebookFacebook page announcing that the food cart would be shutting down. Reads the post We tried repeatedly to try to work out peaceful solutions with the organizations and individuals protesting, but it all came back to being told almost daily to either support the anti DHS agenda or suffer the consequences Quote Unquote.Needless to say, threatening violence against third parties for not being sufficiently in favor of ones chosen cause is inexcusable. Its also remarkably counterproductive.Candidates and CampaignsRoll Call Senate Candidates Mislead When Announcing Fundraising NumbersBy Simone PathéAt least two Republican Senate candidates who kicked their own money into their campaigns issued misleading statements about their second quarter fundraising this month.Press releases that paint a rosier picture of candidates fundraising than their official quarterly reports are a reminder of the anachronistic reporting standards to which only Senate hopefuls are held.Unlike House candidates - or anyone else registered with the Federal Election Commission - Senate contenders do not have to file their reports electronically.They file them on paper, which means theres a lag between when the campaigns try to get good headlines by announcing their numbers to the press and when the press is able to actually review those reports. Local reporters, though, have been picking up on the discrepancies.The StatesChicago Tribune Rauner blasts Chicago mayoral candidate Willie Wilsons cash giveaway, state says he didnt violate campaign rulesBy John Byrne and Rick PearsonMayoral candidate Willie Wilson apparently did not violate election law by handing out more than 200,000 in cash and checks Sunday to people at an event he attended with Gov. Bruce Rauner at a South Side church, according to the state elections board.Wilson campaign spokesman Scott Winslow said the millionaire businessman gave the money to people to help them cover the cost of their property taxes and other expenses as part of his long-standing philanthropic work through the Dr. Willie Wilson Foundation, a registered nonprofit...Illinois State Board of Elections spokesman Matt Dietrich said the fact that the money came from Wilsons foundation seems to allow him to avoid running afoul of campaign finance laws.As far as we can see, it looks like he didnt use campaign funds for this, Dietrich said. And there doesnt appear to have been any quid pro quo, like, Heres some money, vote for me. So from our perspective, it doesnt look like there was anything illegal about this.Chicago Board of Election Commissioners spokesman Jim Allen said the board is monitoring the situation. We havent received a formal complaint, and even if we did, we arent in the municipal campaign yet, so its not clear what our authority would be, other than to refer the situation to law enforcement, Allen said.Las Cruces Sun-News Farmers Market voter registration flap continues to stir debateBy Jacqueline DevineLocal progressive activist Lucas Herndon said his First Amendment rights were violated when he and other voter registration agents were told they could not circulate through the Farmers and Crafts Market of Las Cruces registering new voters.And so, Herndon was back at the market signing up new voters Saturday, one week after a compromise was reached preventing such activity.I dont think that compromise was appropriate. The city still hasnt solved the fundamental problem, Herndon said. By saying this activity, voter registration, has to be restrained is violating the First Amendment in a big way and New Mexico state law as it is interpreted when it comes to voter registration.Herndon said he didnt have any problems Saturday, despite the prohibition from the city and farmers market...Herndon said he understands the Farmers and Crafts Market is a nonprofit, but that doesnt change the fact that it is still on a public street which is available for free speech activities.Their lease does not preclude or change the fact that this a public main street. No matter what they have argued in the past, this is Main Street, Herndon said. Its a street managed by the city, which is us, the citizens, and I have every right to be here walking up and down the street asking people a question. ...Doña Ana County Clerk Scott Krahling said he is working with the farmers market to try and offer a permanent solution to the disagreement.San Antonio Express-News San Antonio fire union to sue city over alleged First Amendment violationBy Josh BaughAt a hastily called press conference Thursday, San Antonio firefighters union boss Chris Steele announced plans to sue the city for violating the First Amendment rights of firefighters gathering signatures on three charter amendment petitions at a public library earlier this year.City spokesman Jeff Coyle, who attended the press conference, said immediately afterward that theres lengthy case law upholding the citys right to regulate free speech, pointing to language within a 2013 memo that the union had distributed, and adding that the announcement was nothing more than a political stunt.What I think this is about today is an effort to distract from the unions own negative publicity. If any of you all have been following the Express-News coverage of the union, its been reported for several days now that the fire union has not been appropriately disclosing or reporting its political activity, he said. I think what youre seeing is the union calling a press conference today about something months ago that case law has long since decided in our favor.",homeless

Standing at the South Lawn, just meters from the Rose Garden where the Oslo Accord were signed 27 years ago on September 13, 1993, the comparison between the two agreements was inescapable. That ceremony was an act of political theater unsurpassed in the history of Israel. Yasser Arafat, chairman of the PLO, and architect of modern terrorism, grinned ear to ear as he received the royal treatment on the White House Lawn. Seeking peace, Israels then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin promised the PLO land, money and weaponry, which Arafat used to build a terror state on the outskirts of Jerusalem. Arafat in turn promised to end terrorism, accept Israels right to exist and resolve all outstanding issues through peaceful negotiations. Arafat was lying. I wanted to believe in the fake peace of 1993. But the grim facts made it impossible. For the past 27 years, first as a member of Israels negotiating team during my service in the IDF and then as a writer and a lecturer, like thousands of other Israelis and friends of Israel in the US and around the world, I devoted myself to exposing the lies and warning about the danger of empowering those who seek Israels destruction. I wrote hundreds of articles, briefed hundreds of politicians and community leaders in the US and worldwide. I wrote a book. And as I sat in the garden at the White House today, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, US President Donald Trump, UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Mahyan and Bahrain Foreign Minister Abdullatif Al Zayani standing in the portico before me, the names of the victims of that previous peace agreement rushed through my head. David Biri, Nachson Waxman, Kochava Biton, Ohad Bachrach, Ori Shachor, the Lapids, the Ungars, the Fogels, the Schijveschuurders, Madhat Yusuf, Shalhevet Pas and on and on and on156157 Russia Responds to Syrias Economic Plea158 by Daniel Davis The Kremlin reaffirmed its vow to support Syria after President Bashar al-Assad requested economic help last week.

President Barack Obama issued an executive order barring US citizens from doing business with the Syrian government in addition to embargoing oil imports. President Donald Trump doubled-down on the hard-line approach to Syria, citing human rights abuses. Much like the Trump administrations maximum pressure campaign against Iran, the US may sanction any individual, anywhere in the world for conducting business deals with Assad. 159 Polands Belarus Plan Gets EU Support160 Poland has managed to get the majority of European Union states to agree with its proposed aid package for Belarus, which would be implemented as long as Belarus agrees to hold free elections. The foreign policy initiative is Polands boldest within the EU since the days of the Ukrainian crisis. It should also help Poland to offset the disputes it has been having with the EU under the present administration in Warsaw. The program for Belarus is modelled on that which Brussels instituted for Poland in the 1990s. The plan is seen as a counter to Russian President Vladimir Putins offer of a credit line of 1.5 billion for Belarus, with the EU offer initiated by Poland seen as more attractive. The EU market that would be opened up for Belarus is 12 times the size of that of Russia.161 Judd Apatow Calls Out Hollywood Censorship in China Theyve Bought Our Silence With Money162 Judd Apatow is refusing to let Hollywood off the hook for allowing itself to be censored in international markets such as China in order to reap financial rewards.

In fact, at the time of his arrival, he is said to have been dressed in the same clothes he wore on the night of the arson.

portland,Climate Disasters Are Leaving Families With Nowhere to Go,2020-09-25T00:00:00Z,The Nation Blogs,OPB,"She didnt see any smoke. But within half an hour it was there, dark and ugly. Carolina was caring for her son in the mobile home where she lived south of Medford, Ore., with her husband, father, and brothers. Carolina and her husband are undocumented immigrants from Mexico, and because they are currently pursuing an asylum claim, we are withholding their last names. The men had left at four that morning for work picking pears, apples, and grapes on a nearby farm. When the smoke got thick, Carolina, who doesnt drive, called her husband to pick her up. By that time, police had arrived in the neighborhood and were telling everyone to leave. Nearby, Carolina recalls, everything was burning. She gathered a few legal documents, took her son by the hand, and fled. There is virtually nothing left now of the mobile home where Carolina lived. Most of her neighborhood, which was home to a number of immigrant families, was swallowed by the Almeda fire, one of more than 2,000 wildfires that ripped across the West Coast in late August and September. In Oregon they consumed a million acres, double the last decades average for a fire season. In California, fires tore through an area almost of the size of Connecticut. The blazes drove tens of thousands of people from their homes, and the smoke trapped everyone else. For a week it felt as if the world had shrunk, the horizon invisible behind layers of smog, the air the color of dirty sherbet. In Portland, which for several days had the worst air quality1 of any city in the world, the haze eventually lifted like a lid off the city. But for people like Carolina the crisis is hardly over. Carolina, her husband, Constantino, and her son, Miguel Angel, who is 11 and has developmental delays, came to the United States last year, and moved into the mobile home that her father owned and had lived in for a decade. Now thats gone, along with the cars that were parked outside and everything else the family had besides the clothes they were wearing, the car the men had taken to work that morning, and the few documents that Carolina managed to grab. The family of seven spent the first night in the parking lot of the Jackson County Expo Center along with thousands of other evacuees2. Then they moved into a small camper on the farm where Constantino works and, recently, into a larger camper purchased with donations from a GoFundMe campaign3. Constantino and the other men kept picking fruit in the choking smoke. Not working wasnt much of an option. No one has gotten sick, thank God, Carolina said. They need to work, because now we dont have a house, and the cars were burned. Carolinas family didnt have any kind of home insurance, she said, nor did most others who lost homes in her neighborhood. Finding a new one wont be easy. Affordable housing was already scarce in the Rogue Valley, an agricultural area home to a significant immigrant community. Before the fires the area had a rental vacancy rate below 2 percent, according to the Los Angeles Times4, one of the lowest in the country. A third5 of the residents of Talent, a town of 6,500 just south of Medford that was substantially demolished by the Almeda fire, were already spending more than half of their income on rent. Homelessness was on the rise6. Now, a longtime real estate agent in Jackson County estimates7 that the vast majority of what low- and moderately priced housing there was in the area has been destroyed. Its like this fire went after the poorest and most vulnerable people in our community, a city councilor in Phoenix, another community wrecked by the flames, told the Times. Septembers fires are likely the most intense wildfire event8 in Oregons history. Thanks to climate change, the conditions that drove the fireincluding a long drought and high windsare becoming a new normal. For a rising number of families, so is the colossal task of starting over. As climate change magnifies ecological riskmaking hurricanes stronger9, wildfires fiercer and less predictable10its also amplifying inequity. Last year, New York Times reporters spent three months reporting11 from one of the largest homeless encampments in Oakland, Calif., and found that many people were there because of natural disasters. One woman lost her home to a 2014 wildfire in California another lost hers to Hurricane Harvey in Texas. Undocumented immigrants are particularly vulnerable, according to a forthcoming paper12 in the journal Geoforum that analyzes the emergency response and recovery effort after a massive 2017 wildfire in California Despite being on the front lines of disaster, the paper reads, explicit exclusion from recovery and relief efforts leaves undocumented immigrants without a safety net in Californias nearly year-round wildfire season. In Oregon now, its easy to see how climate events, overlaid on top of a housing crisis, wage stagnation, and a pandemic, could leave families like Carolinas with nowhere to go. This problem will only get worse, because in a sense the world is shrinking13. Across the globe, coastlines are disappearing. Saltwater is seeping inland, deadening agricultural fields. Deserts are expanding14, as an atmospheric circulation pattern called the Hadley cell, which creates a dry, hot band around the middle of the earth roughly from the top of the Sahara down to the bottom of the Kalahari, shifts northward. Without a dramatic change in global greenhouse gas emissions, extreme heat will become common15 in the South and Southwestern US, as well as a swath through India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and China where a fifth16 of the worlds population lives. According to a recent New York TimesProPublica analysis, 28 million Americans, not just in the West but also in states like Georgia and Florida, are likely to face mega-fires by 2040, while 100 million people live in areas projected to become so hot and humid that working outside will be a health hazard. As more and more people flee from natural disasters, there will be fewer and fewer decent places to go. Carolina went back to see what remained of their home a few days after she evacuated. Everything turned to ashes. Nothing good remained, she said. Her family has gotten some assistance from local organizationsgroups like the Unete Center for Farmworker Advocacy17 and Oregons Latinx farmworker union, Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste18, are distributing aidbut she said that to actually rebuild or find a new home, she and other families will need a lot more help. Carolinas father and brothers, who have legal status, could go back to Mexico for a while and then return, but shes still waiting on a court date for her asylum case, and has had trouble finding legal assistance. My son, my husband and I, it will be more difficult for us because we do not have a work permit, she said. We want to stay here because we are honorable people and we want to work, to have a better future for our child. Asked what about that future she thinks the fire will change, Carolina said, Well, everything.  1  2  3 38utm_campaignp_cpshare-sheetamp38utm_mediumcopy_link_all  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18","homeless, homelessness, housing crisis, affordable housing"
portland,The cities that are already defunding the police,2020-06-27T00:00:00Z,Axios,OPB,"Whats happening In Minneapolis, the Park and Recreation Board, the University of Minnesota, the public school system, and museums and venues have ended or limited their relationship with the police department, the Star Tribune reported. 3 Last week, the Baltimore City Council approved a 22.4 million budget cut 4for the police department. The Portland City Council cut 15 million5 from its police budget earlier this month. 5 million of that would be put toward a new program that sends unarmed first responders to answer homelessness calls.Philadelphia cancelled a planned 19 million increase for the police department and shifted 14 million of the police budget elsewhere  including affordable housing. The city council in Hartford, Connecticut voted to cut or reallocate6 2 million of its police budget.In Seattle, every department budget is being trimmed by around 10, Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan told Axios Dan Primack on the ReCap podcast. We have to reallocate parts of the budget to take things out of the police department that shouldnt be there ... We have to rethink what remains in the police department, Durkan said. Other cities where officials are calling for changes, according to Local Progress, include San Francisco, San Diego, Los Angeles, Oakland, Milwaukee, Denver, Durham, Winston-Salem, Chicago, New York City and D.C. What theyre saying What is really inspiring is really seeing this movement in city after city after city really working to define for those places what public safety looks like, and what our budget should look like, Local Progress director Sarah Johnson told Axios. Its kind of a reflection of our values as a society. Yes, but The defund the police movement is also strongly polarizing 53 of Americans have an unfavorable view of the movement, compared to just 34 who view it favorably, according to an Axios-SurveyMonkey poll7. The split becomes narrower when the words defund the police arent used.What to watch While the mood is ripe for change in Eugene, Ore., our city government is not designed for immediate reaction, said city council member Greg Evans. Similarly, Dallas City Councilman Casey Thomas told Axios that advocates may not get the full reallocation from police this year, due to the short time frame for the budget process.Nevertheless, he said, In the event that you dont get what you want, stay engaged and stay involved.The U.S. Conference of Mayors on Thursday released principles8 to guide a police reform framework that mayor and police chiefs can adopt to deter patterns of racial discrimination. That framework is expected to be announced in the next month. Between the lines Ongoing protests have put pressure on local decision makers to review police programs and policies just as many cities prepare to start the fiscal year on July 1. Many cities also have been in the process of revising their current fiscal year budgets because of financial shortfalls due to COVID-19, experts say. This will force budget cuts across a broad range of city services  including public safety. While the protests could force more budget cuts to come from police budgets, moving those funds to social programs could be difficult. There wont be money for that, said Michael Belsky, Executive Director of the Center for Municipal Finance at the University of Chicagos Harris School of Public Policy.  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8","homelessness, affordable housing"

portland,Low morale hinders Atlanta police recruitment,2021-10-04T00:00:00Z,Axios,OPB,"Why it matters. Police departments say low morale has put a dent in their efforts to recruit for positions that are under intense scrutiny by the public amid high-profile officer-involved shootings in Atlanta and around the country. Details Police departments and sheriffs offices can obtain the bonuses by applying for grant funding through the states Office of Planning and Budget website1 through Dec. 31. Personnel eligible for the bonuses include state, local or school police officers criminal investigators probation and parole officers firefighters EMS sheriffs and their deputies corrections officers bailiffs fish and game wardens and 911 dispatchers. Context Facing whats sure to be a stiff reelection battle from presumed Democratic challenger Stacey Abrams, Kemp has made support for law enforcement  and criticism of Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms for the citys spike in crime  part of his platform2. The governor used 2 million from the states emergency fund to create a crime suppression unit made up of local police, state troopers and other law enforcement officers to address crime in the area, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution3 notes. Yes, but While the bonuses could offer a short-term boost in morale, leaders of local public safety agencies say a lot more needs to be done to help hire new and keep seasoned officers. Axios reached out to the Atlanta Police Department, which declined to participate in this story. However, the agency said on its Facebook page4 that more people are showing an interest in joining its ranks. Fulton County Sheriff Patrick Labat said his department has 124 vacancies, which is down from 171 when he took office in January. While Labat said the bonuses are a magnificent first step in addressing low morale in law enforcement, local departments have to be more creative in keeping current employees and attracting candidates. To attract new hires, Labat says, Fulton County commissioners raised the sheriffs offices starting salary for deputies to 50,000. The department now offers a 9,000 signing bonus to anyone who commits to working for three years at the Fulton County Jail as a deputy. The department, which has just under 1,100 people on staff, is also considering providing a 250 child care stipend for single parents, the sheriff said. To speed up the hiring process, the department conducts on-site physical fitness assessments at job fairs. You have young people who want to fight crime, but we do a poor job of marketing ourselves, Labat says. The other side Some criticism has been lodged at Kemp for using federal coronavirus relief funds to pay for law enforcement bonuses. Hannah Riley, communications director for the Southern Center for Human Rights, said law enforcement agencies have been talking about low morale for at least a decade, even after they get everything they ask for. I think its especially hard to hear that this is coming for COVID relief funds in a state thats been utterly decimated by COVID-19, she said. Riley said instead of providing bonuses to officers, Kemp could use that funding to help provide access to affordable housing, healthcare and educational opportunities supporting people who are at risk of domestic violence and sexual assault and ensuring people housed in correctional facilities are safe and healthy.  1  2  3  4",affordable housing

This recent surge in discussion of neighborhood associations made me wonder what authority do these organizations really have? The City of Portland recognizes5 95 neighborhood associations, grouped into seven district coalitions.",homeless
portland,Portland's Neighborhood Associations Going Strong After 40 Years,2017-11-10T00:00:00Z,JD Supra,OPB,"The Office of Neighborhood Involvement ONI publishes standards6 and guidelines7 to which the associations must adhere. In return, the associations receive funding, assistance, and official recognition read political clout. According to ONIs 2017-18 budget8, coalitions and associations will receive over 2.5 million this fiscal year, amounting to a quarter of ONIs total annual budget. The associations and coalitions do not wield governmental power. By way of voting on resolutions or lobbying the City, they provide community input to the City on decisions such as permitting or law enforcement. But neighborhood resolutions are not laws or ordinances. For example, the recent Montavilla resolution urges the City to stop sweeping homeless camps in the neighborhood, warning that they may be unconstitutional and may constitute human rights violations. Theoretically, a neighborhood association could sue a government on behalf of its members or in its own right, but the neighborhood resolution does not actually prohibit the City from sweeping camps in the neighborhood. Despite not having governmental power, neighborhood associations can make powerful allies or enemies in efforts to influence how, when, and where Portland continues to develop. Some commentators9 have noted that, in a City whose Council is not based on geographic districts, the neighborhood associations can play an outsize role as chief cheerleaders for geographically-centered issues, and have a history of success. Still, others10 have highlighted criticisms that neighborhood associations have failed to represent the breadth of demographics and viewpoints of their residents. Some residents have even accused Portland developers of injecting their agendas through the neighborhood associations, ghostwriting proposals to be presented to the City Council and added to Land Use Board of Appeals records. Other sources11 cite neighborhoods current and historic resistance to rapid development. I dont always agree with some of Portlands neighborhood association resolutions and statements, including from my own neighborhood.

portland,On Strawmen and Racism,2020-06-05T00:00:00Z,Dissident Voice,OPB,"First, as it is worded, it posits that white people are a monolith, that all white people are racist. Second, it posits that the election was decided between being white and black and not between being Democrat and Republican. Third, and most egregiously, the question posits that the white racism, to any significant degree, does not exist. His second question  Are white people racist by nature?  is a strawman. First skin pigmentation does not correlate with an inherited attitude. Obviously any racism is inculcated or otherwise learned. You are not born into the world a racist. Then PCR asserts, based on the false premise, Those who say whites are racist by nature simultaneously claim that hundreds of thousands of Lincolns soldiers died in order to free black people from slavery and that white people in the North carried on a relentless long war against white people in the South for the benefit of black people. PCR claims that the Civil War was simply to free black people from slavery. PBS.org framed3 it otherwise, A common explanation is that the Civil War was fought over the moral issue of slavery. In fact, it was the economics of slavery and political control of that system that was central to the conflict. At the time of the Civil War, PCRs argument must be that northern whites were not racist, at least not by nature, but the southern whites must be racist since they practiced slavery or were insouciant to the practice around them. The argument that whites are not racist is becoming puzzling because whites are being divided up into those who are not racist because they are opposed to slavery and those who support slavery, hence they must be racist based on their behavior. As far as northern whites are concerned, the writer has answered his own question about whether slavery is a part of the white peoples nature. Or is PCR hypothesizing that such a nature can be overcome? Moreover, if slavery equates with racism and data indicates that it does because seldom was slavery imposed by whites on other whites in the US, and never chattel slavery, then PCR must by virtue of his argument agree that, prior to the Civil War when slavery was also practiced in northern states, the slave owners and those who were silent about slavery in their region were racist. PCR continues to try and shoot down the notion of white-on-black racism It is these same racist white people who passed the 1964 Civil Rights Act 56 years ago and permitted the establishment of racial quotas and contract set-asides for blacks that gave blacks rights and privileges that white people do not have. Here PCR cherrypicks points to support his thesis that whites and I maintain this must be understood as some whites are not racist. However, the comparatively preponderant mass incarceration4 of blacks, the comparatively preponderant shootings of blacks5 by police, the comparatively preponderant homelessness of blacks6 and so much more7 points to racism being entrenched and systemic. Since whites rule the roost, these white roosters and the white bystanders bear responsibility. The writer continues to press his viewpoint, If white people are so racist, how can it be that many of them are upset about George Floyds death from police violence and some joined the protests? Either white people are racist by nature or they arent racist by nature. First, it was PCR who came up with the strawman argument that white racism is part of white nature. The premise, as already argued, is fallacious and to argue against ones own fallacious premise is plainly illogical. Second, now the writer points out that many whites are upset about George Floyds death from police violence ergo, there are some whites who are supposedly insouciant or maybe even pleased about the police killing. The conclusion is that not all whites are racist and certainly not by nature racist. The writer asks, So what is police violence against white people? Are white people murdered and brutalized by police because of their skin color? Is this structural violence against white people? The writer wants to look at a multifaceted issue with a black-and-white lens. Obviously that is a wrongheaded way to approach any issue. If one genuinely wants to understand an issue, one should consider all the possible causes related to the outcome in question, and not investigate only as an either-or issue the latter being a path to bias and prejudice. No reasonable thinker denies that there are factors beside racism that predispose police to brutality and killing. Peer pressure, the corrupting influence of power, militarization, media glorification of cops, etc. People know that some police run rackets, engage in the drug trade, sex trade, accept freebies, practice extortion, etc. Cops that do not participate but know of such criminality among their ranks are also bad apples. Although there are a plethora of bad apples in the police orchard, few would argue that all cops are bad apples. However, given the sordid side of policing and the militarization of policing in the USA, becoming a cop might not be the best career choice for a morally centered person. There may be some who enter a career in policing ignorant of the systemic racism and criminality and others who know but vainly hope that they can be part of bringing policing back to the role of serving the public. PCR continues, A multicultural racially diverse society, which the United States has become as a result of illegal immigration and the change in immigration law in 1965, cannot survive if race hatred is a feature of the society. No country can survive if race hatred is a feature of the country. As for illegal immigration, why frame it in terms of legality? Was it legal when Europeans slaughtered the Indigenous peoples of Turtle Island and stole their land? Who is primarily responsible for the emergence of a multicultural racially diverse society which I see as an enrichment of a tolerant society? Was it not white people who violently inserted themselves into a continent of several Indigenous nations? Was it not white people who abducted Africans as chattel? PCR criticizes the protestors None of those screaming racism are interested in stopping police violence. If they are not interested in stopping police violence, then why are people in the streets? As for screaming racism, a random sampling of the placards does not indicate racism as a motif of the protestors. The abundance of signs read8 Black Lives Matter, I cant breathe, Justice 4 George Floyd, and No Peace, No Justice. PCR raises another strawman Of course there are racists, but the assumption that these animosities exist only between skin colors is problematic. In modern times the most extreme manifestitions sic of racial violence are tribal between blacks themselves, such as the Rwandan genocide, the mass slaughter of Tutsi by the Hutu. Who assumes animosities exist only between skin colors? It seems that PCR argues this to attack black-on-black violence. He elides white-on-white extreme violence such as Nazi Germans against other Europeans, Jews, and Communists the British-on-Irish violence etc. PCR also is ignorant of the western read white worlds involvement in the Rwandan genocide.19 PCR raises another point of contention. Indeed, the black slave trade is the product of blacks themselves and has its origin in 1600 in the slave wars fought by the black Kingdom of Dahomey. It is as if it never was written. It is not down the memory hole. This is tu quoque argumentation by PCR. It is elementary morality that we are responsible for our crimes and atoning for those crimes. That blacks also practiced slavery does not make white slavery against blacks or any other peoples any more acceptable. All slavery is abhorrent, but our focus should primarily be on righting our wrongs. PCR asserts, Whites, of course, have committed far more violence against one another than they have against people of color. First, PCR verges on contradicting himself, as he wrote in the same article In modern times the most extreme manifestitions sic of racial violence are tribal between blacks themselves. Second, PCR, too often, does not substantiate what he writes. According to professor David Stannard, The destruction of the Indians of the Americas was, far and away, the most massive act of genocide in the history of the world.210  After 1492, 95 percent of the Indigenous people were wiped out maybe 100 million.311 Third, the logic fails big time because no one denies inter-group violence. Does that mean that one cannot feel prejudice toward an out-group member? During the world wars, blacks and Indigenous peoples joined the military and fought even though still experiencing discrimination and racism within the military against the enemies of the US. Nationalism can often cause a coming together of different groupings within a country. PCR complains, Even white language is said to be racist. The banned n-word is said to be symbolic of white racism. But every white ethnicity has been called names that are slurs dago, polack, frog, limey. The Irish are bog-trotters. White language!? What is white language? Is that English as is spoken by so much of the world that includes African countries, India, Hong Kong, etc? As for slurs, there are words better avoided because of the hurt and offense they can cause to others.412 PCR asserts that his questions do matter to a racially diverse multicultural society.Such a society cannot survive the cultivation of racial enmity. When the goal is revolution, not reform, racial enmity is the weapon. I postulate that a great deal of the protests are because proposed reforms have led nowhere. The system perpetuates itself. It is the system that needs to be overthrown and replaced. That calls for revolution. As Mark Twain once said, I am said to be a revolutionist in my sympathies, by birth, by breeding and by principle. I am always on the side of the revolutionists, because there never was a revolution unless there were some oppressive and intolerable conditions against which to revolute.513PCRs depiction of the Rwandan genocide as against Tutsi by Hutu requires a note. Edward Herman and David Peterson cast doubt on the monopoly media narrative in their book Enduring Lies The Rwandan Genocide in the Propaganda System, 20 Years Later.

It wasnt exactly glad tidings for the holiday, but the workers of the world of Disney cheered loudly in late December as they voted overwhelmingly to reject the companys latest contract offer2 for its thousands of Orlando service employees. The workers chose to demand more negotiations rather than settle for a miserly wage offer, even if it meant heading into the new year with more uncertainty. Ad Policy3 The political climate has raised the stakes for the wage talks, as Floridas massive hospitality workforce has been besieged by a brutal storm season, stagnant wages amid soaring costs of living, and, under Trump, an onslaught of federal immigration crackdowns. Disney, meanwhile, is rounding out a banner year with a deal to take over the Fox News empire. According to the contract schedule, the union can renegotiate wages now as part of a contract renewal in 2019. Disneys last offer for a pay increase fell short of the demand from the union, UNITE HEREs Service Trades Council, for a 15 starting hourly wage. Currently only about one in eight of the 38,000 union workers, including some 10,000 hospitality and housekeeping staffers, along with cast members and ride operators, earns 15 an hour. The last wage hike at Disney inched up starting pay from 8.03 to 10. The companys current proposal would increase raises from 6 to 10 percent over two years, resulting in a boost in the floor wage of about 50 cents annually, and even less for higher-paid workers. The union has been pushing for living wages for months, pointing out that many resort workers are being pushed into homelessness. While Disney previously promised to work toward fair and equitable terms4 in the negotiations, workers drew the line in early December, rejecting Disneys bid by a vote of 9,117 to 643.Related Article While wage negotiations remain in limbo, the situation is even more complex for the Haitian immigrants in Disneys workforce The Trump administration is moving, over the coming months, to end Temporary Protected Status TPS5 for tens of thousands of immigrants from Haiti, El Salvador, Honduras, and other countries who have lived and worked in the United States under special protections following massive environmental and social catastrophes in their homelands. Though the system is highly precarious, over the years many immigrants from the Global South have used the temporary status to gain legal employment and sustain financial ties to disaster-stricken countries. Overall, TPS holders from Haiti have contributed an estimated 2.8 billion to Haitis GDP over a decade. Their remittances provide not only a massive infusion of much-needed cash for Haitis deeply impoverished economystill not recovered from the aftermath of the 2005 earthquakebut also support vital diaspora communities in the United States. Roughly half of the 110,000 Haitian migrants residing in the US are here on TPS.They came as survivors of unprecedented environmental crisis since the early 2000s the country has suffered political conflict, a catastrophic earthquake that destroyed much of the urban core, followed by a ferocious epidemic of cholera, and to this day the country still remains extremely poor and unstable. The Orlando metro area is among the diasporas top host regions, with about 3,000 Haitian TPS migrants. The local tourism sector, which Disney dominates, has provided a steady source of low-wage jobs for Haitian immigrants. Collectively, while their annual wages average only around 18,300 considerably less than Honduran or El Salvadoran TPS workers, Haitian TPS holders contribute nearly 43 million per year6 in Medicare and Social Security funds. At the same time, the TPS population has become a bulwark of diasporic communities in the United States, comprising parents, students, and political activists, including active union members. The administrations announcement that it would cut off TPS triggered a nationwide public outcry from labor and civil-rights groups, who seek an immediate extension, as the Obama administration had regularly done. The TPS end date has officially passed for Haitians, but, under public pressure, the White House is giving migrants until 2019 to officially depart.Current Issue UNITE HERE organizer Wilna Destin helped rally union activists and other migrant-rights groups to push for TPS, as well as an extension of the DACA protections for undocumented youth, on behalf of some 500 Haitian TPS Disney workers. The union has become a leading champion of immigrant workers rights7 under Trump, pressuring both employers and lawmakers to help protect undocumented workers from ICE raids and detention by establishing sanctuary policies in municipalities as well as for workplaces. Many of Destins fellow union members have been on temporary status for years, but are now being uprooted from their new lives and sent back to an extremely unstable homeland. Some migrants are too frightened to risk remaining in the country and have tried to escape across the US-Canada border8seeking asylum in a second country of refuge. Destin herself is supporting family members back in Haiti, where her mother and cousins still live. In communities of extended family networks, she adds, We dont see only brothers and sisters, we see cousins, we see neighbors. If youre here, everybody depends on you. I have a classmate from high school, she has six children, when she calls meI have to send her something. Its not only family, you know, its everybody. The 18-month departure window does buy the workers a bittersweet reprieve, though It gives them just enough time to make it to the next round of contract talks in 2019. In fact, employers in Orlando and other major TPS destination cities are heavily dependent on Haitian migrantsif all these workers were to lose their legal status and employment authorization, according to one projection by the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, it would lead to massive job displacement and business-turnover costs of nearly 60 million. But those massive figures arent the main concern of workers like Nervela Charles, who makes 10.50 an hour cleaning about 18 hotel rooms a day at Disneys All-Star Music Resort. With five children to support, she struggles daily to keep up with the cost of housing and utilities in an area where a living hourly wage is approximately 24 for a one-parent household with a child. For now, the number shes focusing on is 15, as she counts the days she and her coworkers have left to get there. If you dont have the money, she says, then you cant do nothing to fight for a better life. Every day Im working, hard, hard, hardno money. I have my dreams Im fighting for thats why I fight.  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8",homelessness
portland,School mask wars far from over,2022-03-01T00:00:00Z,CalMatters,OPB,"Dr. Mark Ghaly, the states top health official, said California is treating schools differently than other venues because people often cant choose where they send their kids to school in the same way they can decide which businesses to patronize. Ghaly They go to school because thats the school in their neighborhood. Thats the school theyre assigned to. Thats the school where they get essential services, developmental services, access to food. And so we have all along treated schools a little bit differently. Newsom unveiled the changes in a joint press release3 with fellow Democratic Govs. Kate Brown of Oregon and Jay Inslee of Washington  but those states had already announced a timeline for ending their school mask mandates. Oregon health officials on Feb. 7 said the rule would expire4 no later than March 31, and Inslee in a Feb. 17 Medium post5 said face masks would no longer be required in Washington schools and child care facilities starting March 21. Teachers unions on Monday emphasized the importance of local decision-making in any changes to school mask policies. E. Toby Boyd, president of the California Teachers Association6 Simply put, while some students are ready to immediately remove their masks, others remain very afraid. We urge local school districts to continue to work with educators and families and to act cautiously while prioritizing the safety of students, educators and their families. Meanwhile, some parent groups suggested that Newsom and other state leaders could face political repercussions for requiring kids to wear face coverings at school long after they were made optional for most Californians in most locations other than7 health care settings, public transit, homeless shelters and prisons. Megan Bacigalupi, executive director of California Parent Power The public health and state response to the pandemic has destroyed trust between California parents and elected officials regarding whether the public school system is prepared to put children first in a crisis.

State Sen. Mike McGuire, one of the bills co-authors California has unique and remarkable economic power in this circumstance. As the fifth-largest economy in the world, we must use this power for good. We can help stop this autocratic thug, Putin, by enacting our own financial divestments.

Meanwhile, party leaders  who plan to endorse nearly all state lawmakers running for reelection  have responded to the caucus with iron-fisted actions, including essentially blocking it from withholding support for lawmakers who opposed a failed single-payer health care bill18 and watering down its proposal to stop accepting money from oil and gas companies and law enforcement groups.Shergill19 The party uses every advantage it has under the bylaws to ensure there is no democracy in the Democratic Party.Tenoch Flores, a former communications director for the California Democratic Party20 One of the beliefs is that if you have impassioned speeches and you scream truth to power, you can have policy change overnight.

The election process can be slow and voters sometimes deliver surprises, but the current system where voters clearly select one choice works, ODonnell said.

portland,House Financial Services Subcommittee Issues Testimony From National Fair Housing Alliance Senior VP Bailey (Part 1 of 2),2022-04-27T00:00:00Z,Targeted News Service,OPB,"While HOLC institutionalized racial segregation in mortgage lending, it also guaranteed banks and financial institutions profits from the loans being made to White suburban borrowers in developments that emerged during the New Deal. This financial capture allowed banks to transfer private risk to the federal government through FHAs federally backed loans. A benefit of this outcome is that cheaper mortgage credit became more accessible, driving investor demand for more mortgages, because capital was so richly rewarded, it increased banks profits.61 These profits extended to the government sponsored enterprises, and because of the markets manipulation, White homeowners received mortgages with low down payments, reduced interest rates, and extended terms driving segregated affordable housing developments in suburban communities across the nation and limiting prosperity to Whites.62 The ongoing impact is that White individuals typically breathe less toxic air, have a stronger revenue base to fund education and other critical community infrastructure needs such as parks and recreation.",affordable housing

Pastor Jeff Wakeley said the church had not been served the lawsuit papers and therefore did not have comment on the matter. The church is zoned in the citys C-4 central business core. That permits emergency shelter with a conditional use permit, which the church has submitted and is being processed by city staff, according to the release. The application will be presented to the Great Falls Zoning Commission within the next few weeks. The C-4 district does not permit campgrounds, which is the basis of the citys suit in District Court.

This includes something called Ninja Warrior Parkour, which features everything from swinging ropes and monkey bars to obstacle courses. The evening we visited Discipline Wrestling to observe this exercise program, dozens of kids were having a great time while working up a sweat. And the kids parents seemed to be so grateful that their children were having so much fun while embracing physical fitness programs. So, whats not to love?

It is ridiculous that Arab and Islamic countries are angered by Indian politician Nupur Sharma for speaking the truth about Prophet Muhammad who indeed married Aisha when she was six years old and consumed the marriage when she was nine. Why does India apologize? he wrote on Twitter. He also wrote a word of advice to India that it should not be intimidated by Islamic countries and added that appeasement would never work and would make things worse. He also added that the Indians should defend Nupur Sharma.

Since that time, Simmons, who serves as an associate pastor at Hope United Methodist Church in Bloomington, Illinois, has challenged basic theological concepts, projecting a worldview where divinity rests not in God but in queerness. In a church preparing to split over LGBTQ issues, the drag queen pastor, who embraces queer theology while barely attempting to plaster on the basic tenets of Christian theology, has become a lightning rod. Conservatives argue that Simmons role as a celebrated figure among progressive Methodists proves the church has become so radically liberal as to forswear Christ. Progressives promote Simmons and invite him to preach in drag as a way to challenge the conservative position on sexuality that the denomination officially still takes. 207 NFL Team Appoints First Openly Transgender Cheerleader208 Charlotte-based NFL team the Carolina Panthers have added a male cheerleader who identifies as a female to its roster of cheerleaders.

The Democratic leadership has identified seven priorities, including spending money on rural communities, behavioral health, public safety, homelessness, workforce development, energy efficiency, education and help for low-income Oregonians.",homelessness
portland,"Legislative plans could repair roads in rural Oregon , promote energy efficiency, help the homeless",2022-02-22T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,OPB,"If their plans go through, some roads and bridges in rural Oregon are likely to be repaired, sewer systems could be improved and waits to get into residential mental health facilities could shorten. Homeowners who want to install solar systems may get rebates and those who lack job skills are likely to be offered training programs to build careers in health care, construction and manufacturing. People who are homeless may get access to temporary housing while apartment dwellers will get financial help to install air conditioning units and cooling centers will be created to keep people safe during heatwaves. Lawmakers have had more money to spend this session. A state forecast increased the budget by nearly 1 billion from unexpected tax revenue. And in a relatively novel approach, the majority Democrats have handed 100 million to their Republican colleagues to spend as they decide. The impact is expected to be most profound in rural - and Republican - corners of the state. Rural Oregon was an area that we looked at and said this is an area that we wanted to target investment in terms of infrastructure and economic development, Rayfield said during an online news conference with reporters on Monday afternoon. Its a good day when Republicans and Democrats can come together for the good of all Oregonians. This money will help move forward important public projects throughout Oregon. - Sen. Tim Knopp, R-Bend The Democratic majority gave Republicans budget-writing authority to decide how to spend the money. That move, first reported1 by OPB, marks a step towards more civil relations between the two parties, which have been combative and fraught with suspicion and anger in the past. Republican leaders said they were initially suspicious of the offer, wondering what Democrats wanted in return. Rayfield said the budget offer wasnt an olive branch but rather a practical move because Republicans represent many of the rural areas of the state. There are absolutely no strings attached, Rayfield said. This is about making meaningful change in communities across the state. Republican leaders, who reached out to their legislators for priorities, welcomed the opportunity to have a say in the budget. Its a good day when Republicans and Democrats can come together for the good of all Oregonians, Senate Republican leader Tim Knopp, R-Bend, said in a statement. This money will help move forward important public projects throughout Oregon. The group that worked on proposals included lawmakers from the coast, mid-Willamette Valley and the central, southern, eastern and north-eastern areas of the state, according to a news release. These will be transformational investments to improve rural communities for generations and create hundreds of good paying jobs, Rep. David Gomberg, D-Otis, said in the release. He worked with Republicans on spending plans. Rayfield said Republicans, who initially identified more than 100 million in spending, are scaling back some of their proposals. Details are still being worked out, but legislative sources said money will go toward flood prevention, road safety, sewer improvement, wastewater and drinking water treatment and broadband support. Energy efficiency, climate-related projects Fighting climate change is one of the Democrats priorities. Theyre earmarking 100 million for energy efficiency improvements, solar energy, drought relief and helping Oregonians stay cool during heat waves. Drought, fire and other climate disruptions put the most vulnerable Oregonians at great risk, Sen. Kate Lieber, D-Beaverton said in a release. By investing in resilient homes and clean energy, we can build safer and healthier communities, reduce the cost of energy for consumers and create good paying jobs. The package includes bills aimed at keeping Oregonians cool when temperatures rise to life-threatening levels. Proposals expected to pass include money for cooling and warming centers and a provision that would allow renters to put air conditioning units in apartment windows. Part of the 100 million will be used for sewer upgrades, wastewater treatment and drinking water treatment, while other money will go towards helping Oregonians impacted by wildfires and drought. The state - and the West - is heading into its second year of drought, which has left reservoirs low and sparked an early fire season. Weather forecasters expect a wet March and April and the return of hot, dry temperatures in May. The spring rain could help prevent an early fire season this year. The 100 million in climate-related spending includes adding more money to a fund that helps low-income Oregonians repair and renovate their homes to make them safer and more energy efficient, according to a news release. The Healthy Homes Repair fund was established in the 2021 session, and, according to Rep. Zach Hudson, D-Troutdale, is part of a commitment by lawmakers to help people whove been the most affected by the climate crisis while promoting clean energy. Budget writers also plan to set aside money for another program established last year. Lawmakers budgeted 10 million for the Oregon Solar and Storage Rebate Program, which allows low-income homeowners to receive 60 rebates of the cost of a solar system. Other homeowners qualify for a 40 rebate. Legislators also plan to invest in electric vehicles by spending money on charging networks for trucks and provide consumers new incentives to drive electric vehicles. As part of their focus on emission reduction, a task force will look at ways of reducing emissions from homes and buildings, the second main source of climate pollution. A focus on public safety Rayfield said details of plans to spend more than 100 million on public safety will be released later this week. Some of it will be focused on behavioral health support, Rayfield said. There will also be a focus on victim supports. A bill to help behavioral health residential providers recruit and retain staff moved out the House Behavioral Health Committee and is now with the Joint Ways and Means Committee. The bill includes about 200 million, with increased reimbursement rates for Medicaid patients. Its not clear the spending on that has been whittled down. Behavioral health providers have said they need 200 million to stay afloat. Another public safety bill before the Legislature would give money to community groups for intervention and violence prevention. Rayfield said lawmakers realize that they need to focus on that to break the chain of violence, adding that the public safety initiatives had bipartisan support. Were hoping to have a fairly substantial package released on Wednesday, Rayfield said. Homelessness and affordable housing are also Democratic and Republican priorities, and both sides are keen to raise the standard of living. Proposals are in the works to increase tax credits for low-income Oregonians and spend tens of millions of dollars on grants for child care providers to help them hire more staff and expand their programs. Surveys show that Oregonians spend a bigger share of their income on child care than many other Amercians. Overtime for farmworkers One of the most controversial bills this session is a proposal to pay overtime to agriculture workers after a 40 hour workweek. House Bill 40022 passed out of the House Committee on Business and Labor on a party line vote, and is now in the House Revenue Committee. Rayfield said it would soon move out of that committee to the Joint Ways and Means Committee, which works on the budget. He said Democrats hope to get to a point where Republicans can support the proposal. It would phase in time and a half pay for farmworkers after a 40-hour work week over five years, with tax credits to employers for six years. Republicans proposed allowing employers to essentially have a break for paying overtime for 22 weeks, which would cover peak seasons. Rayfield said the Democrats convened listening sessions with Republicans to hear their position on the bill and formed a joint committee in the Senate, with another to be announced on Tuesday that will try to broker a deal. Rayfield said Democratic lawmakers are trying to understand how we can get to a Yes. Farmworkers have been denied overtime since the 1938 federal Fair Labor Standards Act. Their supporters say the law was racist, originally targeting Black farmworkers in the South, and that they deserve to get overtime like other workers. Republicans have insisted that the proposal will put family farms out of business and prompt corporations to scoop them up. Rayfield indicated that Democratic leaders are seeking a better working relationship with Republicans. The philosophy of our office and what weve communicated and what our office believes is to honor and respect the Republicans and their right to be able to protest on the floor by reading bills, Rayfield said, referring to a process requiring a full reading of sometimes lengthy bills.  1  2","homeless, homelessness, affordable housing"

Michael Fuller, who made a last-ditch legal maneuver last week to halt the clearing of tents from Laurelhurst Park, says he surreptitiously attached Apple AirTag tracking devices to 16 personal items with permission from several campers ahead of the clean-up by city contractor Rapid Response Bio Clean. Now, Fuller says, the wireless location signals show some of those possessions  including a pair of gloves, a speaker, two canvas paintings, and a french press  ended up at the Recology Oregon waste transfer station  Under Oregon law, Portland is required to collect and retain all property that is recognizable as belonging to a person and that has apparent use when cleaning up homeless encampments, according to OPB. The confiscated material is stored in a warehouse for 30 days, unless such items are unsanitary or have no obvious use. Fuller says the items were clean and useful. Its an innovative use of the affordable trackers. Since AirTags rely on nearby iPhones for position reporting, theres likely a delicious possibility of poetic justice here The iPhones that reported their presence at the trash facility may well have belonged to the workers who took the possessions there. Fuller says he hopes that the action will stop any repetition of the practice. Via Apple Insider3. Photos Portland Tribune4 and Nikita Ognev5Unsplash6 FTC We use income earning auto affiliate links.

The statement stressed that state leaders would need to see a decline in the rate of the spread of the disease before large-scale reopening and that each state is also building a state-specific plan. California entered a stay-at-home order on March 19.3 Oregon Gov. Kate Brown implemented a statewide order on March 234, as did Washington Gov.

Together--well meet this moment. joint statement also announced that a greater focus would be made on protecting vulnerable populations and disadvantaged communities. Gov. Newsom will announce more details regarding Californias specific reopening plan on Tuesday, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.7 New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo also announced a similar effort8 Monday that is being developed in partnership with New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, and Delaware. The news comes as unemployment rates9 continue to climb across the country as city shutdowns bar nonessential businesses from operating, resulting in layoffs. The state of California is also on week 4 of a stay-at-home order10 to contain the coronavirus disease, which was issued just two days after the San Francisco Bay Area entered its own. The Bay Area region has garnered national attention for its early social distancing measures taken in mid-March. Some health experts say that the region is indeed succeeding11 in flattening the curve, or stalling the spread of the disease by restricting human contact throughout the city to prevent the healthcare system from being overwhelmed. However, California also has a sizeable backlog of pending test results. Other parts of the US followed suit with enforcing stay-at-home orders, and now theyre looking to the Bay Area and the state of California as a whole for guidance on how to respond to the virus and also for some indication of when life could return to normal. Regardless of what some say is a success on behalf of California in keeping case counts down, public health officials and city leaders continue to stress the importance of heeding the stay-at-home order and social distancing measures in keeping the spread of the virus at bay. Relaxing those restrictions prematurely could exacerbate the spread of the disease. There are 24,02912 confirmed cases of the virus in California, with 721 reported deaths.

In contrast, prices continue to slowly increase in more affordable housing markets such as those in Indiana, North Carolina, and Texas. This difference is a result of the amount of rural land-use regulation in these states. All of these urban areas limit low-density development using urban-growth boundaries, concurrency requirements, or similar policies, thus making housing both expensive and volatile. Californias rural regulations are so strict that the 2010 census3 found that 95 percent of the states residents are confined to 5 percent of the states land area, and the urban areas in which they live are twice as dense as the average density of urban areas in the rest of the country. Moreover, under California law, counties cant reduce those restrictions by, for example, expanding urban-growth boundaries unless they spend tens of millions of dollars writing environmental impact reports, which no local government is willing to do. In addition, it can take five years or more to get a permit to build one home, much less the tens of thousands of new homes that California needs each year. This makes it nearly impossible for developers to respond to changes in the demand for new homes. Instead, such changes result in wild shifts in home prices. There are minimal land-use restrictions in the rural lands around these urban areas. These keeps housing affordable and allows builders to meet flucuating demands. In states such as Texas where there is little rural land-use regulation Texas doesnt even allow zoning in unincorporated areas, the supply of housing is fluid and can meet new demands whether the population is growing fast or slow. When demand increases, builders build more homes when it declines, they reduce their rate of production. This minimizes price fluctuations. As Ive explained before4, the seed of the 2008 financial crisis was the decline in housing prices in restricted areas after 2006  a decline that the mortgage bond buyers and ratings companies did not expect. But prices in unrestricted areas didnt decline until after 2008. In other words, the volatility of prices in restricted areas caused the crisis price declines in unrestricted areas, if they happened at all, were a result of the crisis. Contrary to what some may hope5, the recent decline in housing prices wont make housing more affordable and it certainly wont increase homeownership rates. This is partly because declines in home prices are likely to be accompanied by increased unemployment and reduced personal incomes. But, in addition, the very fact that prices are so volatile makes homeownership less desirable. Volatility makes a home purchase a risky investment because people cant predict when they might get a new job elsewhere and need to move. Just as those who bought homes in California in 2006 would be in financial straits if they had to sell in 2012, people who bought in 2018 may be disappointed if they have to sell in 2022. No wonder Californias homeownership rate is lower today than at any time since the 1940s and is the 49th lowest6 of any state in the nation. The War on Homeownership Many of those who do own homes in California sighed in relief with the death7 of Senate Bill 508, which would have eliminated all zoning restrictions9 within a half mile of any rail transit station and a quarter mile of major bus stops. That included nearly all of San Francisco and most of Oakland, Los Angeles, and other major cities. Yet the fight isnt over as homeowners now have to confront Senate Bill 33010, which would mandate increased densities in neighborhoods throughout California cities. Although the details of the two bills are different, SB 330 has been called the evil twin11 of SB 50. Nearly 82 percent12 of occupied single-family homes in this country are occupied by their owners. Nearly 87 percent of occupied multifamily homes are occupied by renters. This is partly due to preference and partly because single-family homes are more conducive to ownership than multifamily. Policies against single-family homes are therefore also policies against homeownership. The dual premises behind these bills, as well as an Oregon bill that would ban single-family zoning13, are that single-family zoning makes housing more expensive and that multifamily housing is more affordable than single-family. Neither of these assumptions are true. Low-Density Housing Is Affordable If single-family zoning made housing expensive, then Dallas and San Antonio, which have single-family zoning, would be significantly more expensive than Houston, which does not. In fact, the median home in the Dallas-Ft. Worth urban area is a little more expensive than in the Houston urban area, but in San Antonio it is less expensive. Most of the differences are attributable to differences in income according to the 2017 American Community Survey, the ratio of median home prices to median family incomes value-to-income ratio in all three regions is about the same. Housing costs are much higher in regions with rural land-use regulation. Source Zillow. Across the nation, the vast majority of cities have single-family zoning, yet most housing in those cities is not significantly more expensive than in San Antonio or Houston. What makes housing expensive in places such as California, Hawaii, Oregon, and Washington is severe restrictions on rural development, which have limited the supply of new homes. Density Is Expensive While single-family housing isnt the cause of housing becoming expensive, neither is multifamily housing the solution to housing affordability problems. The idea that density is more affordable is contradicted by the fact that California urban areas are already the densest in the nation at 7,300 people per square mile in 2017, the Los Angeles-Anaheim urban area is the nations densest, followed by San Francisco-Oakland at 6,800, San Jose at 6,300, with New York only number four at 5,500. The densities of regions with urban-growth boundaries have significantly increased, which has only made housing less affordable. Source 1970 census and 2017 American Community Survey. The rising density of California urban areas since 1970 has been accompanied by rising housing prices, not more affordable housing. The population density of the San Jose urban area has grown by 70 percent since 1970, while the areas value-to-income ratio has grown 235 percent, which means it is less than a third as affordable as it was before the growth-management plans that restricted rural development were put into effect in the mid-1970s. In general, affordability is negatively correlated with density, and large increases in density are always accompanied by large declines in affordability. This is because housing costs are a function of land prices and construction costs, and land prices are higher in denser areas while the costs per square foot of building dense housing are greater than single-family homes.The average price of an acre of land in regions with rural land-use constraints is much greater than in regions without. Source Albouy, Ehrlich, and Shin, 201714. Based on a 2017 study15, land costs in urban areas with restrictions on rural development are typically five to ten times greater than in areas with no such restrictions. This means housing densities have to be five to ten times greater than in single-family neighborhoods in order for the land costs per housing unit to be as affordable as they are in areas with minimal rural restrictions.Because they use more steel, cement, and other expensive materials, construction costs of mid-rise and high-rise buildings are much higher than for low-rise. Arenson actually expressed costs as a percent of the cost of a single-family home, but since basic construction costs start at around 100 a square foot, I converted to dollars. Arenson also said high-rise costs were 5.5 to 7.5 times low-rise, so I averaged to 6.5. But construction of housing at such densities costs far more than construction of single-family homes. According to California developer Nicolas Arenson, building 20 units per acre three-story townhomes costs 50 percent more16 per square foot than one- and two-story single-family homes. Building 26 units per acre four-story townhomes costs twice as much. Building 50 units per acre five-stories, he says, costs three to four times as much, while 100 units per acre in high-rise housing costs 5.5 to 7.5 times as much as single-family homes. So when officials say they want to make housing more affordable by building denser housing, they arent talking about building 2,400-square-foot homes, the average size of new single-family homes17 in 2018. Instead, they are talking about apartments that are less than half that size the average size of new multifamily rental units in 2018 was under 1,100 square feet, and many affordable housing plans call for building apartments that are as small as 660 square feet18. The Planning Conspiracy Although affordable housing is the latest excuse for plans to increase housing densities, urban planners supported densification long before affordable housing became an issue. In the past, they have offered many objections to so-called sprawl, meaning low-density suburban development, but all of those objections have proven specious.Only about a third of the nations agricultural lands are used for growing crops, and little more than half of those lands are used for the food we eat. Ending ethanol subsidies would do far more for protecting rural lands than attempting to control urban growth. They say sprawl threatens farms and open space. But all urban areas in the United States occupy just 3.0 percent of the country. Meanwhile, a third of the nations land, or about 1.1 billion acres, is agricultural lands, and only a third of is actually used for growing crops. Since per-acre yields of most major crops are growing faster19 than the nations population, the need for croplands is actually declining. Sadly, anti-sprawl policies destroyed Hawaiis agricultural industry because they made housing so expensive that farmers couldnt afford to pay workers, so the number of acres used for growing crops has declined by well over 70 percent. Converting marginal agricultural lands to urban lands can greatly increase the nations productivity, especially by making housing more affordable. They say sprawl contributes to congestion, but actually it is density that causes congestion. The most congested urban areas in the United States  Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, and so forth  are also the densest. Low-density development represents employers and families who are escaping from the dense, congested parts of urban areas. They say sprawl leads to too much driving and therefore wastes energy and produces excessive greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, a detailed analysis20 by David Brownstone of the University of California, Irvine concluded that the effects of density and urban form were too small to be useful in saving energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. They say Millennials dont want to live in single-family homes. In fact, all the data show that, not only do most Millennials aspire to live in low-density areas21, most of them actually live in the suburbs22. The hidden agenda of many city officials is increasing their tax revenues. Developments outside of existing cities will not pay taxes to those cities, especially in states that have made it difficult for cities to annex land. Urban-growth boundaries and other rural land-use regulation are merely another way for cities to insure that they get the taxes from new development. Zoning and Property Rights Some people support bills to eliminate single-family zoning because they see them as a restoration of property rights. But people buy homes in single-family neighborhoods expecting that either zoning or protective covenants will insure that the house next to theirs isnt turned into an apartment, shopping center, gravel pit, or crack house. In contrast to farmers who strongly object to their farms being downzoned to prevent future development, it is the homeowners themselves who most strongly object to the elimination of zoning. In his book, Zoning and Property Rights23, libertarian Robert Nelson argues that zoning represents a form of collective property rights, in which everyone agrees to limit the use of their land on the condition that their neighbors do the same. In the absence of zoning, developers have found that protective covenants increase the value of the homesites they sell. Historically, such covenants preceded zoning, and zoning was just a way to gain the same benefits for neighborhoods that were already built. Today, almost everyone living in a single-family neighborhood bought their homes after zoning or covenants were put in place, so no one has actually lost any property rights. To think that eliminating single-family zoning might be one step towards eliminating all zoning betrays a naive view of the politics of urban growth. Housing and Race Proponents of the redevelopment of single-family neighborhoods to higher densities call themselves environmentalists even as they accuse opponents of being racists. In fact, it is the proponents of rural land-use restrictions whose policies are racist. When measured by comparing the actual movement of black people compared with total population growth, the San Francisco-Oakland urban area is the most racist region of the country. Source American Community Survey. Thanks to the high housing prices caused by such restrictions, the number of blacks living in the San Francisco-Oakland urban area has fallen by 10 percent since 2006, while the number living in the Los Angeles-Anaheim urban area has fallen by 3 percent. Meanwhile, the number living in Atlanta, Dallas-Ft. Worth, San Antonio, and other urban areas that lack rural land-use restrictions has grown faster than the over population of those areas. Conclusions People in nearly every age and income class aspire to live in single-family homes. Destroying single-family neighborhoods to make housing affordable not only isnt necessary, it wont work. Urban areas and states with unaffordable housing should instead abolish restrictions on development of lands outside of existing urban areas. Such a change would do far more to make housing affordable and restore property rights than focusing on single-family zoning.

Prices are high in these areas because of urban-growth boundaries or other restrictions on development of rural areas at the urban fringes of these states and regions. Collectively known as growth management, such restrictions increase the price of developable land, allow cities to impose development restrictions without fear that developers will go outside the cities, and increase labor costs as home construction workers fight to find affordable housing along with everyone else. Instead of abolishing these restrictions, the people who imposed and support them want to rezone neighborhoods of single-family homes for higher densities. Oregon and Minneapolis have both abolished single-family zoning. California has proposed to do so in transit corridors. Yet there is no evidence that single-family zoning makes housing expensive or that building multifamily housing will make housing more affordable. Rather than debate the evidence, advocates of density have resorted to calling supporters of single-family zoning names such as NIMBYs not in my backyard and racists. This paper will show that most Americans live in neighborhoods of single-family homes because they want to and that their preferences are both legitimate and not a threat to housing affordability. The Mania for Density A century ago, most urban planners wanted to help people move out of dense, inner-city tenements1 and into lower-density single-family neighborhoods that they thought were safer and healthier. In the 1920s, that goal was being achieved thanks not to urban planners but to affordable, mass-produced automobiles such as the Model T Ford, which gave working-class families affordable mobility to reach affordable housing in the suburbs. Yet the exodus of working-class people from the cities led some planning advocates to question the goal, starting in class-conscious Britain. Socialist C.E.M. Joad2 was upset that people whose tastes in clothing and music were different from his own could be seen cackling insanely in the woods and upon seashores and river banks, lying in every attitude of undress and inelegant squalor. Clearly, thought Joad, the extension of towns must be stopped. English planner Thomas Sharp3 offered a solution in a 1932 book called Town and Countryside4 he proposed that the government build great new blocks of flats which will house a considerable portion of the population. This idea was supported by Swiss architect Le Corbusier, who proposed in 1935 that all urban residents be housed in what he called a Radiant City5 of high-rise housing that allotted an average of 153 square feet of floor space per person or about 600 square feet for a family of four. In 1947, the socialist-leaning British Parliament passed a law inspired by Sharps ideas called the Town ...untry Planning Act6. This law nationalized the development rights to rural land landowners were allowed to keep their land, but they could only develop it with permission from the government and they were required to pay a fee equal to the increase in land value resulting from the new development. Naturally, this greatly dampened rural development. In its place, the government built hundreds of high-rise housing projects. This law has been described as a natural extension7 of the feudal system that prevailed in England after William the Conqueror successfully invaded the country in 1066. Even today, less than half a percent of English families own at least two-thirds8 of the country. To compensate these aristocrats and oligarchs, the Parliament paid them and continues to pay them agricultural subsidies that today average about 150 an acre9 and is actually more10 than landowners earn from farming. The United States followed the international trend of building high-rise housing for low-income people with passage of the Housing Act of 194911, which led to huge urban renewal programs aiming to demolish low-income neighborhoods that planners called slums. When New York City planned to use urban-renewal funds to turn Greenwich Village into high-rise housing, architecture critic Jane Jacobs and her neighbors successfully stopped the project. She subsequently wrote The Death and Life of Great American Cities12, arguing that the mid-rise four- to five-story housing in Greenwich Village wasnt a slum and in fact was a vibrant neighborhood. Jacobs managed to persuade a new generation of planners that trying to house everyone in high-rises was a bad idea. Instead, they want to build mid-rise housing like that found in Greenwich Village to house everyone or, at least, far more people than today. All development13 should be in the form of compact, walkable neighborhoods, argued the Congress for the New Urbanism, which also wants the reconfiguration14 of sprawling suburbs into such compact neighborhoods. Compact is another way of saying high-density, which in New Urbanism terms generally means mid-rise developments. Under their vision, no one would be allowed to live in low-density, single-family neighborhoods. Valid Reasons for Keeping Densities Low Yet there are good reasons why more than 60 percent of occupied homes in the United States are single-family structures detached from other houses. Single-family attached, or rowhouses, make up another 6 percent. The first is less congestion, as low densities mean there arent enough people to create meaningful congestion. Adding multifamily housing to a neighborhood whose street network has been designed to support single-family homes is going to make congestion significantly worse. Second, single-family neighborhoods tend to have less crime, not because criminals are more likely to live in multifamily housing but because multifamily housing tends to be more inviting to burglars and other criminals. After comparing crime rates with architectural features on thousands of city blocks, architect Oscar Newman15 concluded that housing with a preponderance of common areas were more likely to attract crime than housing with lots of private land because its easier to identify and exclude people who dont belong from private land than from the commons. A more recent study16 found that New Urban developments attracted more crime and were several times more expensive to police than areas with more private yards. Newmans book, Creating Defensible Space, is available for free download17 from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Newman also found that alleys attract crime because they offer burglars relatively hidden entrances to homes while cul de sacs deter crime by giving criminals fewer exits from a crime scene. New urbanists support alleys while they oppose cul de sacs. A third reason people like single-family homes is privacy. Homes that dont share a common wall with other houses will be quieter and private yards are mini-parks that people can customize to their own preferences, whether as swimming pools, patios, childrens play areas, gardens, or a combination of several of these. Finally, people prefer low-rise housing because it is affordable, at least on a per-square-foot basis. Theres a good reason why postwar homebuilders such as the Levitt Brothers and Henry J. Kaiser concentrated on building single-family homes to provide affordable housing for returning soldiers and their families. These homes were small by todays standards  typically 750 to 1,200 square feet  but they offered opportunities for expansion that couldnt be found in multifamily housing. For all these reasons, it isnt surprising that even surveys conducted by the Congress for the New Urbanism find that the vast majority of Americans prefer or aspire to live in low-density neighborhoods18 that exclude multifamily housing. For example, a 1995 New Urbanist survey found that 73 percent of Americans prefer suburban developments with large lots and wide streets to residential urban areas, including narrower streets, sidewalks, and shared recreational areas. Other studies found as many as 83 percent preferring single-family homes. The Myth of the Demand for Density Despite these survey results, density advocates have promoted the claim that peoples tastes are changing and that manyspecifically Millennials and retiring Baby Boomersno longer want to live in single-family homes and instead want to live in vibrant inner-city neighborhoods. While there may be some truth to this, the numbers appear small and it isnt clear that there is a shortage of dense neighborhoods to meet this demand. In 2006, a University of Utah planning professor named Arthur Nelson published a paper19 claiming that so many people would want to live in high-density housing by 2025 that the United States would have a surplus of 22 million single-family homes. As reported20 in The Atlantic, the suburbs would become giant slums or ghost towns. Nelson did not say how he reached this conclusion, only that it was based on his interpretation of the same surveys that found that 73 to 83 percent of Americans preferred to live in a single-family home. He did urge urban planners to reshape the landscape by promoting construction of more high-density housing to meet the demand that he fantasized would exist in 2025. Nelson went on to write reports for various cities and regions predicting low demand for single-family homes and a high demand for multifamily. For example, his 2014 report21 for the Minneapolis-St. Paul Metropolitan Council predicted that the demand for rowhouses and multifamily dwellings in the area would rise from 426,000 today to 619,000 in 2040, while the demand for new single-family homes would grow by just 25,000.Because high-density housing costs more to build, the price is generally greater than that of low-density housing even though the demand for high-density is lower. While it is difficult to imagine how even the best supply-and-demand analysis could be accurate enough to predict housing needs 26 years into the future to the nearest 1,000 homes, Nelson didnt even attempt to do such an analysis. In fact, his report betrays no understand of the concepts of supply and demand at all, and instead he cites himself as the sole source for much of his projections. Contrary to his use of the term, demand is not a single quantity, like 619,000, but a relationship between prices and quantities. To say the demand is 619,000 without specifying a price is like saying someone is traveling at 5 miles per without specifying whether that is per hour a fast walker, per minute an airplane, or per second the International Space Station. The fundamental problem with claims that people want to live in dense cities is that they completely ignore price. They ask people, Would you rather live in a walkable neighborhood or one where you have to drive everywhere? when they should ask, Would you rather pay 400,000 for an 1,100-square-foot condo where you can walk to a high-priced limited-selection grocery store or 200,000 for a 2,200-square-foot single-family home where you can drive to several supermarkets that are fiercely competing with each other to get your business? As revealed by where most Americans actually live, most would choose the latter. The Myth that Growth Management Doesnt Increase Housing Prices Even before Nelsons 2006 paper, some metropolitan planners aimed to significantly reduce the share of people in their regions living in single-family homes. In 1996, MetroPortlands regional planning organizationset a target of reducing the share of households in single-family homes from 65 percent, which it had been in 1990, to 41 percent by 2040. The main tools used to achieve this goal were the urban-growth boundary, which made land inside the boundary much more expensive rezoning of several dozen neighborhoods of single-family homes to multifamily housing a minimum density zoning requirement that all new construction had to be at least 80 percent of the maximum density allowed in any zone and subsidies to developers of high-density housing.The cost of an acre of land in a growth-managed region is typically 2 to 15 times greater than an acre in areas without growth management. Portlands cost is lower than Seattles because Portland has at least added some land to its urban-growth boundary as the population has grown, while Seattle and California regions have not. Source National Bureau of Economic Research22. By 2015, Oregons Cascade Policy Institute reported23 that it was almost impossible to buy or build a new house in the Portland area with a decent-sized backyard and that this had nothing to do with demand but was a result of deliberate policies. Meanwhile, median home prices in the Portland area have increased from 2.0 times median family incomes in 1990 to 4.2 times incomes in 2018. However, as of 2018more than halfway to 204059 percent of Portland-area households still lived in single-family homes, well short of the 2040 target of 41 percent. Like Seattle, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, Portland is going through a much-discussed24 housing crisis25. Yet few have proposed to abolish the urban-growth boundary to improve affordability and planners still insist that the boundary didnt make housing expensive. To support this claim, they point to studies26 such as one finding that Portland home prices were no higher than those in Denver and Seattle, claiming those regions lacked urban-growth boundaries. In fact, Seattle has had one since 199227 and Denver since 199728, and both had practiced some form of growth management before those dates. Meanwhile, regions that are growing as fast or faster than Portland but that truly do not have urban-growth boundaries, such as Indianapolis, Orlando, and San Antonio not to mention Atlanta, Dallas, and Houston are far more affordable than Portland.Construction costs are higher in growth-managed areas largely because labor costs are higher as construction workers have to pay more for their own housing. These costs include only construction and not land or permitting costs permitting can easily add 100 per square foot or more to the cost of homes in growth-managed regions. Source BuildingJournal.com29. Prices shown are for a two-story, 2,000-square-foot home with wood siding. Partly because of the efforts of planners in Portland and other regions practicing growth management, the nation is facing a shortage30, not a surplus, of single-family homes. This is forcing people into multifamily housing not because it is their preference but because of the artificial scarcity of more desirable housing. The Myth That Single-Family Zoning Makes Housing Unaffordable Instead of abolishing the urban-growth boundaries that have made housing expensive, planners have demonized single-family zoning, claiming, among other things, that it is racist31. While a few early zoning codes were racist in nature, if we got rid of everything that was ever used by racists, it would mean an end to public schools, churches, restaurants, transit buses, and drinking fountains, and many other things. Until it was abolished in Minneapolis, virtually every major city in America other than Houston had single-family zoning, yet it didnt significantly increase housing prices so long as builders could find vacant land for new housing. It was only when urban-growth boundaries and similar growth-management tools limit the amount of that vacant land that housing becomes unaffordable. The Myth that Density Is AffordableThere is a strong negative correlation between housing affordability and population density. Shown here are the densities and price-to-income ratios for the 59 largest urban areas in the United States the correlation coefficient is 0.82. Source American Community Survey. The corollary to the claim that single-family zoning made housing unaffordable is the claim that increasing densities will make it affordable again. This is belied by a comparison of urban densities with their affordabilities higher densities are almost always less affordable than lower. Hong Kong, one of the densest urban areas32 in the world, is also the one of the least affordable33. In the United States, both the densest cities, such as New York and San Francisco, and the densest urban areas, such as Los Angeles, San Francisco-Oakland, San Jose, Miami, and New York, also tend to be the least affordable. The correlation isnt perfect, but in general density is less affordable both because both land prices in dense areas and the costs of constructing dense housing are higher.BuildingJournal.com34 says the extra cost of building mid-rise compared with low-rise apartments is greater than the extra cost of building a custom vs. an economy home, while the extra cost of building high-rise is greater than the extra cost of building a luxury home. Planners misuse these data to claim that people must value density more because they are paying more to live in it. This shows more ignorance about how supply and demand works due to its higher costs, the supply curve for dense housing is lower to the left of the supply curve for low-density housing, so even if the demand curve for dense housing is lower, the price at the intersection of supply and demand can be higher. The Myth That Single-Family Zoning Takes Away Property Rights Urban planners have persuaded some property-rights advocates to support densification on the claim that single-family zoning violates property rights. Emily Hamilton, of the Mercatus Center, supports state preemptions35 of single-family zoning in California to make housing more affordable. Her work never seems to mention the urban-growth boundaries that have truly made housing unaffordable, and she has even argued that the San Francisco Bay Area has run out of land for housing and therefore can only grow more densely. In fact, only about 17 percent of the region has been developed and most of the rest would be available for development were it not outside of an urban-growth boundary. Property rights have been described as a bundle of sticks. One stick, for example, is whether or not landowners can sell their land. At one time, most land in Europe and even some in the United States was entailed36, meaning the owners couldnt sell it but could only bequeath it to their heirs. Another stick is whether or not the government can take land by eminent domain. Fee simple37 land titles in the United States allow this, but a few people have an allodial title38 that is protected from both eminent domain and property taxes. Given these different sticks, one possible stick could say, I wont develop my property beyond certain limits provided everyone around me is subject to the same limits. That is what single-family zoning is meant to emulate, and opponents of legislation to eliminate such zoning argue39 that doing so would violate their property rights, that is, the stick that limits development to protect the stability of the neighborhood. As I show in American Nightmare40, urban homeownership rates in the United States were very low in the nineteenth century, not because homes were expensivein todays dollars, a modest home with indoor plumbing cost about 25,000 while a large upper-middle-class home might cost 150,000but because people didnt want to put money into a house that might end up having a gravel pit, brickyard, or tenement for a neighbor. By 1890, developers discovered that buyers would pay more for homes or building sites if the lot and its neighbors had protective covenants forbidding anything but single-family homes. Such covenants soon became common. Zoning was developed to provide similar protections for existing neighborhoods of single-family homes and most such zoning merely affirmed whatever land uses already existed in an area. A few early zoning codes zoned areas that were used for industrial purposes for housing. For example, Los Angeles zoned a brickyard for residential uses, and the Supreme Courts decision41 affirming this ordinance was a mistake as it violated the landowners property rights. But these were exceptions. Covenants and zoning led to a rapid increase in homeownership rates. Rates grew by more than 40 percent between the end of World War II and 1960, by which time almost every city in America except Houston and its suburb Pasadena had zoned all the land within their borders. Since 1960, most housing developments on unzoned land outside of cities has been supported by protective covenants. What this means is that almost no one today has lost their property rights because the single-family home they own was zoned for single-family uses after they bought it. To the contrary, most consider the single-family nature of their neighborhood to be a property right itself. Some neighborhoods in Houston dont have protective covenants, either because they were never written for those neighborhoods or because they lapsed due to disuse. In lieu of zoning, Houston allows residents of such neighborhoods to petition their neighbors, and if 75 percent agree, they can write their own covenants. The rule requires 75 percent rather than unanimity to get around the holdout problem42, in which one or a few landowners demands payment from the rest in excess of the true value of potential development on their property. Eliminating single-family zoning wouldnt be a problem if residents were allowed to protect their neighborhoods by writing their own covenants using a process similar to Houstons. But urban planners want to be able to impose higher densities on such neighborhoods, so they would never support that. Conclusions Growth management, not single-family zoning, is what has made housing expensive in some parts of the country. Eliminating single-family zoning wont make housing affordable in such areas because it wont reduce land costs and higher-density housing costs more per square foot than single-family housing. Residents of single-family neighborhoods have good reasons to object to rezoning of their neighborhoods for higher densities. In fact, rather than see such rezoning as a restoration of their property rights, they see it as a taking of their rights.

portland,"Will race, income inequalities trip up Cascadia 's fight against climate change?",2021-03-03T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,OPB,"Then she saw the smoke.Im not going to sit here and wait, said Garcia.She evacuated immediately.It was only in Ashland, a wealthier area five miles down Interstate 5, that residents were told to evacuate, activists said after the fire. Jackson Countys emergency alert system left out2 many communities, they said, including Talent, a community with mobile home parks and other low-income housing and a median household income of 40,400. Ashlands median household income is 56,315.People were clueless and our Spanish-speaking community was left out, said Garcia in a recent interview. Damage would ultimately prove more extensive in Talent than in Ashland.The racial and social disparities exposed by the September fire are emblematic of a broader picture Communities of color, low-income people and other marginalized groups are disproportionately impacted3 by the effects of climate change, according to community activists across Cascadia. From country towns like Talent to the diverse urban landscape of South Seattle, activists say the government is not yet fully hearing from the long-marginalized communities that are feeling the biggest effects of climate change.I really see this as a little microcosm of everything thats going on, said Elib Crist-Dwyer, of Rogue Climate, a grassroots organization in the Talent area working to help ensure that people in marginalized communities have the resources to deal with the effects of climate change, and that they have access to clean energy. Of the issues posed, he said Theres racial justice in here, climate justice and economic justice.People seated outside the Fire Mutual Aid Center in Phoenix, Oregon, in February 2021. The aid center opened after a September 2020 wildfire destroyed more than 2,800 homes and other buildings and left thousands homeless. The center offers food, clothing and assistance in finding new housing. Destructive wildfires are predicted to grow more common across Cascadia with continuing climate change. Photo Denise BarattaInvestigateWest Rogue Climates office a converted greenhouse was burned out during the fire. The last time I drove by, it was just an empty lot, said Crist-Dwyer. Nowadays Crist-Dwyer and others from Rogue Climate work at a rented office space in a strip mall. In the same little strip mall, another storefront was turned into a resource center for displaced residents where, You can get anything from water, to a quick hot meal to a new set of dishes, said Crist-Dwyer. He helps clients seeking donations as well as people who need help resettling.Many of the homes that burned in the September fire were trailer homes4 occupied by5 Latinx residents, low-income people, farm workers, seniors and immigrant community members.Even before the fire, Southern Oregon already was dealing with housing shortages and severe rent burdens6.The livability down here is really challenging, Crist-Dwyer said. In cities like Medford and Eugene, close to 30 of renter households spend more than 50 of their income on rent7.Thats even me with a good-paying job, Crist-Dwyer said.He is noticing two trends. The first is that the continued marginalization of communities in this area is contributing to this crisis. The second is seeing the community become activated around justice and equity. Asheville and Ashland to the south of Talent, and Medford to the north, are more affluent communities that have largely ignored the marginalization of communities of color and low-income communities in Talent and Phoenix, Crist-Dwyer said. So theres these communities that have already been really marginalized, without a safety net of any kind, Crist-Dwyer said. Despite the housing shortage and even before the fire, the population of Rogue Valley and surrounding Jackson County experienced steady population growth.The majority of people who lost their homes in the fire want to come back, said Allie Rosenbluth, campaign director of Rogue Climate.But can they? As climate change engenders more fires, floods and other disasters that disproportionately affect communities of color, Cascadia is wrestling with how to protect these communities after a history of largely failing to do so. Increasingly, people of color are seeking a seat at the decision-making tables. Activists say politicians and others are paying more attention to these issues of equity. But theres still a long way to go.Rebecca Johnson, of Ashland, Oregon, hands out meals donated by Apocalypse Chow of Medford, Oregon, to those in need on Feb. 12, 2021, at the Fire Mutual Aid Center in Phoenix, Oregon. Photo Denise BarattaInvestigateWestCrossed signals in South Seattle Industrial South Seattle is one of the most diverse neighborhoods in Cascadia. And one of the most polluted. Its also an example of how communities of color are struggling to be heard as governments make plans to transition to a zero-carbon economy.With air pollution wafting into many residents homes8 from diesel trucks making their way from the nearby Port of Seattle, and the Duwamish River declared one of the nations largest toxic-pollution Superfund sites, the area anchors a swath of high-pollution, high-health-risk areas. Those risks are identified in a map showing statewide environmental public health data from the Washington State Department of Health. The Washington Environmental Disparities Map9 reveals that both the Duwamish River Valley and Puget Sound rank high in environmental health disparities such as larger proportions of residents exposed to toxic soot.All of that has consequences. Life expectancy in the Duwamish River Valley is 13 years lower10 than in wealthier neighborhoods in North Seattle. The longstanding racial and ethnic inequities exemplified in south Seattle were central to the most significant example to date of the movement to decarbonize Cascadia running headlong into aspirations for people of color to be part of the so-called just transition11 to a carbon-free future.Pollution from trucks and other diesel-powered vehicles serving the Port of Seattle joins air pollution from steamships and nearby highways to drive up air pollution levels in many pockets of South Seattle, one of the most racially diverse areas in Cascadia. Activists working for what they call a just transition to an economy free of fossil fuels say years of inequitably distributed environmental risks demand that people of color and other marginalized communities be protected and even helped by the effort. Photo Paul Joseph BrownInvestigateWest Heres how that happened Progressives in Washington splintered their organizing efforts in two ballot initiatives in2016 and 2018 designe to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by taxing them. At the heart of the disagreement was whether tax revenues raised from levies on, for example, carbon dioxide emissions from an asphalt plant should be returned to taxpayers, as happens with British Columbias carbon tax or whether those revenues should instead be used to invest in clean-energy jobs and other benefits to communities of color, labor groups and others who can provide broad support at the ballot box.Both measures failed by substantial margins. For a detailed look at the standoff, see David Roberts piece for Vox12. And now, grassroots community groups working on climate change and racial-justice issues are vowing to fight13 Gov. Jay Inslees latest effort to pass cap-and-trade legislation in the Washington Legislature, saying it would go too easy on carbon polluters without doing enough to help marginalized communities. Inslee says he would put environmental justice and equity at the center of climate policy, and provide green jobs.The transition to renewable energy offers an opportunity to generate community prosperity, says14 Puget Sound Sage, a grassroots organizing group in South Seattle. Our community needs the benefits of the transition to be reinvested back into our wallets, our neighborhoods, and our infrastructure.Where does that leave decarbonization efforts today? Grassroots groups continue to spotlight the possibilities for this transition to benefit previously marginalized groups.Were really interested in getting to a regenerative economy, said Adrienne Hampton, Climate Policy and Engagement Manager of Duwamish River Cleanup Coalition, one organization that has been fighting for climate resilience, meaning that the community can prepare for, recover from and adapt to the impacts of climate change. The Duwamish coalition works to lay the groundwork for community decision-making, create economic equity and eliminate the communitys disproportionate exposure to environmental hazards.The Duwamish River in South Seattle has been declared one of the nations most-toxic dumping grounds and is one of the larger areas being cleaned up under the federal Superfund program. Pollution is one of the factors in South Seattle thought to be contributing to a life expectancy that is 13 years lower wealthier neighborhoods in North Seattle. Against this backdrop of historic environmental inequity, community groups are calling for explicit corrections as the region transitions to a low-carbon economy, moves that would help bring jobs and vitality to long-marginalized communities. Photo Paul Joseph BrownInvestigateWest The Duwamish Coalition is one of many groups across Cascadia fighting to move the economy away from fossil fuels to renewables without burdening already-marginalized communities, or leaving those communities out of benefits. For example, they want to protect low-income people from rising transportation and energy bills that could result from climate policies. And they want all communities to have affordable access to cleaner options such as public transit and home retrofits, as well as new jobs in the renewable energy sector.Puget Sound Sage surveyed15 the community to try to understand what residents thought an equitable transition to renewable energy would look like. The resulting report16 sought to speak the mind of the community. In her outreach, Yolanda Matthews, climate justice organizer with Puget Sound Sage, noted that community members were primarily interested in having lower energy bills, having energy-efficient appliances, and keeping a roof over their heads.However, the city had its own ideas about what the south Seattle community needed. We constantly needed data to back up everything we said, said Matthews. The needs of the community and plans of the city did not align, she said. Puget Sound Sage was hearing that the community wanted an expansion of public transit, better access to weatherization programs for homes and to build energy-efficient affordable housing. However, the city thought that the South Seattle community wanted solar panels and incentives on electric vehicles, Matthews said. The city tends to think that what works for one community will work for the other, said Matthews. Thats why we needed the report, to really prove what our community was thinking and needing, said Matthews.But will the city listen? Only time will tell. And the scene echoes 300 miles to the south. Hitting the gas in Eugene The NAACP branch in Eugene, Oregon is headquartered in the historic Mims House, where the pioneering Black couple CB and Annie Mims welcomed Black travelers in the 1940s when most lodgings for travelers were restricted to whites only. Today the NAACP is seeking to convert the home into a solar energy installation, supported by checkoff donations when residents pay their utility bills. Here, members of the 2018-2019 Youth Council group pose on the porch. Photo Eric Richardson, NAACP EugeneLane County Nat King Cole, Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong some of the biggest Black luminaries of the mid-20th century music scene number among the Black travelers who stayed at the Historic Mims House17 at 330 High Street in Eugene. Why? In the 1940s, they were not allowed to rent rooms at whites-only motels. Fast-forward to this century and the Mims House is the regional branch office of the NAACP, which is working to convert the building into a solar installation project. There arent a whole lot of examples of that in Eugene right now, saidAimee Okotie-Oyekan, the NAACP EugeneSpringfield branchs environmental and climate justice coordinator. The branch is doing this through a grant program with Eugene Water and Electric Board18 EWEB that allows customers to designate a small portion of their utility payment to support the solar installation. Aligning with the national NAACPs Solar Equity Initiative, the branch aims to conduct a demonstration so that the community can learn about clean energy.The NAACP is also a part of a new campaign, Fossil Free Eugene19, a coalition of environmental organizations including Beyond Toxics, Sunrise Eugene, 350 Eugene and Cascadia Wildlands. Two main demands of the Fossil Free Eugene campaign are to ban the construction of all new fossil fuel infrastructure in Eugene and levy a fee on polluters such as NW Natural, the regions natural-gas utility, to create a fund to help historically marginalized and low-income communities make the switch to renewable energy. This funding mechanism takes inspiration from the Portland Clean Energy Fund, a grant program established by a 2018 ballot initiative. The Portland fund is designed to distribute up to 61 million a year in clean energy funding for job training, energy efficiency, renewable energy infrastructure and innovation. It prioritizes low-income residents and communities of color.In early February, the Fossil Free Eugene Campaign scored a victory when the Eugene City Council rejected NW Naturals proposal to renew a franchise agreement allowing the utility to run its pipes under city rights of way. Backed by the campaign, the city was trying to incorporate our climate action and carbon reduction goals into their franchise agreement with Northwest Natural, said Dylan Plummer, grassroots organizer of Cascadia Wildlands. This renewal would have locked the city into another 20-year contract. What was at stake was the legitimacy of our citys climate recovery goals, Plummer said. Our coalition was directly responsible for providing our city councilors with the support needed to take Northwest Natural to task, said Plummer. Despite this victory, activists like Okotie-Oyekan and Plummer say much work remains. A ray of hope in state solar initiative? Its going to take a lot of lobbying and government action to enable a so-called just transition that focuses on equity, activists say, but some glimmers of progress are evident. Take the example of rooftop solar installations. An interactive tool created at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory20 that combines federal data on solar deployment and census data shows that for Washington and Oregon, the upper half of households by income account over 80 of those states residential solar systems.Similar census-enhanced research by Oregons Department of Energy recently added another layer to the solar gap racial bias. Agency director Janine Benner explained during a presentation of the departments 2020 biennial energy report21 recently that, using census data, agency researchers determined that state tax credits to incentivize solar installations have historically flowed disproportionately to areas with more white residents.The benefits for clean energy were not evenly distributed among Oregonians, said Benner.Oregons long-standing tax credits did achieve their primary goal helping transform solar panels into a cost-effective energy source. Providing equity was not an explicit program goal, and it is not surprising that the credits came up short on that measurement. As Benner put it People with low incomes dont have a lot of tax equity, and so credits dont really work for them.That is no longer acceptable in 2021, the state says. Oregons Department of Energy head said they are now designing programs with equity in mind from the start, as directed by Gov. Kate Brown last year and guided by an Environmental Justice Task Force. Solar and home energy storage incentives offered last year, a one-year 1.5-million program, provided rebates that help everyone and reserved a quarter of the funds for low- and moderate-income households and installers. Benner called it a modest step toward equitable distribution.Advocates for a just transition to a carbon-free economy that does not unduly burden already-marginalized people say that after years of struggle, they are seeing hopeful signs.Said Hampton, of the Duwamish River Cleanup CoalitionOne day I woke up and everyone was finally listening to what I had to say.Robert McClure and Peter Fairley contributed to this report.

portland,Flood the zone,2021-07-24T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,OPB,"History does not repeat, Snyder writes, but it does instruct. The worrying, dangerous signs are all about. Pick through the headlines and youll find, if you care to find, lots of evidence - issues and concerns both small and large - of democratic descent that presages collapse. Yes, it can happen here. Consider A rich friend of the former, and he hopes future, president was indicted this week2 for using his access to the highest officials of our government to advance the interest of a foreign government. Federal prosecutors characterized what Donald Trumps pal Tom Barrack3 did as extremely serious offenses based on conduct that strikes at the very heart of our democracy. Barrack is just one of many4 striking at the heart of democracy. In Albany, Oregon, a community in the Willamette Valley south of Portland, the brand-new majority on a local school board took, as Oregon Public Broadcasting reported5, a dramatic step summarily firing a superintendent who had received positive performance reviews and whose contract had just been renewed. Perhaps more strikingly, most of them wont say why. The action was apparently stimulated by political rifts over COVID-19 and racial equity that have played out nationally. The campaigns of the majority members of the board who engineered the firing were funded largely by money outside the community. In short another local school board has become a hot battleground in the raging culture wars that serve to divide Americans and breed a level of intolerance that can lead to something much worse than a debate over how to teach kinds about history. A variety of indicators tell similar stories. Significant numbers of Americans actually favor breaking the country up. Sixty-six percent of southern Republicans6, according to a new poll, support leaving the U.S. and forming a new country. Those sentiments were shared by 50 of independents and 20 of Democrats. Some eastern and southern Oregonians are advancing the fantasy of a greater Idaho7 that would divide the mostly rural areas of Oregon from the allegedly out of touch radicals west of the Cascades. A climate crisis is upon us that threatens vast disruption of world food supplies and a deepening of global inequality. A pandemic rages8 for which a proven vaccine exists, but millions of Americans refuse to accept the science and logic that can save them from severe illness and even death. But but in the midst of the division, chaos, controversy and cynicism of daily life it pays - believe me it pays - to live with someone who refuses to play the pessimism card, while still recognizing the perils we face. Im lucky. So, taking a page from Professor Snyders rules for resisting tyranny - and with encouragement from the breakfast table - I offer my own six-part mini-survival guide for our troubled times. Refuse to be a victim. Many of the defendants facing charges for the assault on the U.S. Capitol in January9 are invoking the defense that the mob made them do it10. Nonsense. No one is forcing you to be a political victim. Its a choice you make. Knock it off. Democracy doesnt settle disputes by smashing things, but by elections and compromise. You got a grievance, dont nurse it, use the political system to work for change. Anything less is a call for anarchy, the kind that has crippled effective response to real problems in cities like Portland. Being a victim is easy. Real, responsible political change is damn hard work. Act on your frustrations. But do it responsibly. Give your time, treasure and talent to causes and people you agree with, but at all cost resist the comfortable impulse to support the dividers and the haters. Every town in America has a non-profit or ten that exists to feed the hungry, house the homeless, heal the sick or stimulate our souls. Get off the sidelines and get in the real game. Check your priors, or better yet update them. We all come to adulthood with priors, beliefs, notions, ways of seeing things that may or may not be valuable or even correct. Self-awareness is a powerful thing. Most of us are never more certain of what we really dont know much about. Seek truth, not a validation of an opinion. This is a corollary to the previous thought. You really can find factual information if you want to. Sifting through the garbage is tiresome and demanding but remember as you search, historys tyrants always seek to confuse and devalue objective reality. The loathsome Steve Bannon11, a world-class purveyor of misinformation, said the quiet part out loud in 2018. The Democrats dont matter, Bannon said. The real opposition is the media. And the way to deal with them is to flood the zone with shit. Dont believe all the crap out there. Remember that ethics and character count - always. In our tribal society we tend to believe my side can do no wrong and your side is evil. What is commonly missing from this formulation is the fundamental democratic requirement that demands that leaders always operate within widely accepted ethical boundaries, and that they have the character to not lie to your face, enrich themselves in office or abuse their power. Without ethics and character democracy dies. Think about the future. We are all short timers here. What is our responsibility to the next generation and the next beyond that? Most of us wont be remembered beyond family and friends, but let us live so as to not be remembered for making things worse, but for trying to make things better for a next generation of Americans. A great challenge of our times is to prevent political and cultural cynicism from becoming self-fulfilling. If you once believed that everything always turns out well in the end, Timothy Snyder writes, you can be persuaded that nothing turns out well in the end. If you once did nothing because you thought progress is inevitable, then you can continue to do nothing because you think times moves in repeating cycles. History is not destiny. It is a guide. Get off the sofa. Get in the game to preserve American democracy.

Did you know you can support The Nation by drinking wine? On a recent evening in Portland, Oregon, Dr. William Toepper put on a paper surgical mask and made his way down a muddy road toward a row of shelters pitched beneath the fir trees. Smoke drifted up from a small fire tended by two women. One of them stood as he approached. You doing OK? he asked.1 Ad Policy4 Yeah, she said. Got any food?2 Weve got survivor kits, Toepper offered, holding out a ziplock bag packed with socks, snacks, antibiotic ointment, and hand sanitizer. Ill take one, the woman said. I want to survive.3 Toepper, a retired emergency physician, is the medical director of Portland Street Medicine, a group of doctors, nurses, social workers, and other volunteers who provide care to people living on the streets, in camps, or in forests in the Portland area. Volunteers go on rounds three days a week, providing acute care and basic medical supplies and offering to connect people with other services. In the past few weeks PSM volunteers have also been sharing information about Covid-19 as part of a multiorganization effort to protect Portlands homeless population, estimated at 4,000, during the pandemic.4 In the field, Toepper goes by Dr. Bill. Hes known this woman, whom Ill call Hannah, for about two years. Hannah is 40, and she has chronic hypertension. Shes on medication, and shes feeling better, she told usexcept for all this crap going on, she added, waving her hands. She was wearing blue latex gloves. Im just stressed out really bad.5 Nearby, a man with a short gray beard poked his head out of a tent. Hed been following news about the coronavirus on his phone. Earlier in the day Oregons governor issued a stay-home order5, closing some businesses and public spaces that many people without housing rely on. Everythings going to be shut down for two weeks now? the man asked. Probably more like six weeks, yeah, Toepper replied.6 How are we supposed to eat? the man said.7 Current Issue More than half a million people across the United States experience homelessness on any given night, and the population faces acute risks from the respiratory virus. Many have underlying health conditions6, including chronic lung disease, HIVAIDS, and mental illness, as well as higher levels of stress, which can weaken the immune system. Even in the absence of a viral pandemic, people experiencing unsheltered homelessness have a mortality rate almost 10 times the general populations and nearly three times that of people living in shelters. Access to sanitation facilities, limited under ordinary circumstances, has been further complicated as public spaces like libraries close and service providers suspend operations in response to the pandemic.8 The first confirmed death from Covid-19 in the US homeless population occurred on March 16 in Silicon Valley since then, in New York City, at least two others have died, and dozens of people living in shelters have tested positive for the coronavirus. Social distancing is difficult if not impossible in shelter settings, though shelters across the country are taking various measures to try to limit the risk, including opening new temporary facilities to relieve crowding elsewhere. For those living outdoors, survival often depends on social bonds. Its a social cohort of people, Toepper said, culturally and sometimes economically. Its tough to distance when your income depends on sex work or canning collecting cans for the recycling deposit. He continued, My sense is that the overall risk of getting Covid-19 is lower, simply because of the fresh air. But once it hits, its going to be less well tolerated. And if it hits, the virus doesnt stay in the homeless encampments. Its a threat to everyone.9 Farther down the row of campsites, a woman named Julie asked Toepper about the shelter-in-place rules. I was wondering if theyre possibly going to round us up and put us in camps, and if thats the case, whats going to happen to my dog? she said. That is certainly not the plan, he assured her.10 Julie asked about the symptoms of the disease, and Brandon Deyo, a registered nurse and PSM volunteer, told her to watch out for cough, fever, and shortness of breath. The hard part is that hospitals are really busy right now because of this, and there are sick people there, so there are risks, he said. But if youre struggling to breathe, then you should go.11 Earlier, Toepper asked Hannah what her anxiety felt like. He described his own as like a pit in his stomach. Oh, man, she said, it goes right to my heart.12 One of the foundational principles of street medicine is that providers meet people wherever they are. Offering regular care directly can avert unnecessary, expensive trips to the emergency room. It also helps build trust with people who might never visit a hospital or clinic, even if theyre critically ill or injured. When somebody comes into a health care setting, if theyre not clean or they dont communicate well or they cant bring their service dog, it can result in quite traumatic experiences, so they avoid it, Toepper said. Our experience on the streets is that people are underutilizing health care.13 Street Medicine provides acute care and basic medical supplies to people experiencing homelessness in the Portland area.Over the past few weeks, Toepper has been grappling with a question thats both logistical and ethical How best to provide street medicine, which depends on personal contact, during a viral pandemic? The difficult thing about doing the work is that contamination measures, distancing, PPE personal protective equipmentits a little more difficult in some of these chaotic environments, he said. Some of PSMs outreach has been scaled back simply because many of its volunteers work in hospitals and are busier than ever because of the virus. One of us is probably going to get Covid, and I dont know how thats going to affect us, to be honest, he said. That prospect amplifies the need to protect not only PSMs volunteers but also the people they treat.14 Several dozen street medicine programs operate in the US. Recently the Street Medicine Institute, which advises local community groups, released recommendations7 that outreach teams be limited to essential personnel and that they focus on reducing the spread of the pandemic, while still providing the best medical care possible to the rough sleeping population. In Portland, Toepper implemented new protocols for distributing medications and supplies to people, and he and Deyo wore masks.15 While Covid-19 complicates the logistics of providing care, the pandemic also makes the work more necessary. In addition to reaching an at-risk population, street medicine can play an important role in public health more broadly. So much of this work, on a practical level, has always been ER diversion, Deyo said. That mission is much more amplified in its importance now, given the need to focus hospital resources on treating Covid-19.16 Beginning on March 11, PSM worked alongside the Multnomah County Department of Public Health and others in an effort to reach as much of the citys unhoused population as possible with information about Covid-19 and supplies, including hand sanitizer. At first, Toepper said, many of the people they spoke with seemed uninterested or suspicious, but over the course of a week, they became increasingly concerned. Like Julie, many were afraid of being swept up and imprisoned in shelterlike environments.17 Advocates argue8 that Covid-19 should not be used to forcibly move people into shelters. Instead, theyre calling for cities to house people in hotels or other private accommodations during the crisis, and they call for significant increases in funding for housing assistance. It has never been more clear that housing is health care, said Diane Yentel, the president and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, in a statement. Advocates worry not only that the pandemic poses risks to individuals without housing but also that the economic fallout could push others into homelessness. The relief package passed by Congress addressed9 some of these concerns, providing 4billion to assist homeless shelters and outreach workers, 1.25 billion for Section8 housing vouchers, 685 million for public housing, and a limited eviction moratorium. Governors in Oregon, California, and other states have implemented broader moratoriums on residential evictions.18 In response to the pandemic, Portland, along with other cities, decided to limit its regular sweeps of encampments10, in accordance with new guidance11 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which advised that clearing camps could cause people to disperse throughout the community and break connections with service providers. This will be a reprieve for many people living outdoors in Portland, which, like so many other cities, has been embroiled in contentious debates about housing affordability and the encampments. The ask from the people living outside is, If we could just stay put for a little while, wed be better able to clean up, wed do better, we would have less impact on our city, Toepper said. After some initial confusion about whether and how Oregons stay-home order affected people without housing, Governor Kate Brown recently clarified12 that her directive is not intended to serve as an enforcement mechanism against Oregons unsheltered population.19 of Portland Street Medicine prepare to treat people experiencing homelessness in the Portland area.Later in the evening, Toepper pulled up to a street in Southeast Portland where several tents were set up. He and Deyo went from tent to tent, calling out, Portland Street Medicine! You guys doing OK? Anybody need any medical attention? They were greeted by silence. Its eerie, said Toepper.20 They approached a beige RV. A small dog leaped against its windows, barking. The woman who came to the door introduced herself as Dee. She described a long list of past and present health problems, including cancer, multiple sclerosis, and fibromyalgia. Deyo asked if shed been following the news about Covid-19. She said no she didnt have Internet access. Shed heard that there was a virus going around but didnt know the symptoms. It sounds like you might be pretty high risk, Deyo told her. When he explained that she should watch out for fever, coughing, and shortness of breath, she cut in Youre talking about my life.21 Throughout the evening, Toepper and Deyo passed out water, the assembled survival packs, and simple medications, depending on what people said they neededMotrin, antacids, sterile saline for a man whod split his finger open and had been told hed need surgery. With many hospitals postponing nonessential procedures because of the pandemic, it wasnt clear when that could happen.22 The next day, Toepper called me. He wanted to underscore the fundamental point of street medicine. It is, of course, to treat medical ailments, he said. But to explain the work by the minuscule, tiny tasks you see doesnt really capture it. Think about the microbiome, he suggestedthe bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms that keep us alive and sometimes kill us, but mostly keep us alive. Our microbiomes arent ours alone theyre shaped by our environment and who we come in contact with. So are the nonbiological things that make us who we are, he continued. The pandemic illustrates this interdependence in a particularly stark way. You cant keep a community healthy if you dont keep the least-healthy in mind and cared for, said Toepper. We are not all living alone, you know?23  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12 utm_campaignbloxamputm_sourcetwitteramputm_mediumsocial","homeless, homelessness, unhoused"
portland,Transit cops could lead police reforms,2020-06-19T00:00:00Z,Axios,KGW,"Jun 19, 2020 Axios Delivered by Newstex Urban transit agencies are rethinking how they prevent crime and maintain order following nationwide protests over racial bias and police brutality in the death of George Floyd and others.Why it matters Transit police  an often overlooked arm of law enforcement  are the ultimate beat cops. Theyre positioned as potential leaders in the effort to defuse anger and rebuild trust in cities where theres renewed interest in the concept of community policing1.Instead of treating fare evasion or homelessness with arrests and prosecution, some transit agencies are experimenting with more compassionate responses to try to address the root causes of those problems. At the same time, agency officials argue a strong police presence is necessary to prevent serious crime and to boost declining ridership.",homelessness
portland,Transit cops could lead police reforms,2020-06-19T00:00:00Z,Axios,KGW,"Context Even before COVID-19, public transit ridership was falling2, due in part to competition from Uber and Lyft, but also because of safety concerns. Many transit systems have sought to beef up their police presence to soothe passengers worries. New Yorks Metropolitan Transportation Authority, for example, in December voted to boost the police presence in the subway3 by 20 over the next four years. But critics say a crackdown on fare-jumpers and homeless individuals looking for shelter in stations often targets people of color and low-income people. One example In February, Metro Transit Police in Washington, D.C., came under fire for handcuffing and arresting a 13-year-old boy4, renewing complaints that they unnecessarily target black passengers for detainment and questioning.Fare enforcement essentially is criminalizing being low income. And you can say exactly the same thing about transit police who are charged with clearing out homeless passengers, said Hana Creger of the non-profit Greenlining Institute, which focuses on economic and racial justice.These are just Band-Aid solutions for much deeper, much more entrenched problems than policing can actually solve. Whats happening Some transit agencies agree and are taking steps to defund their police budgets or adopt new approaches.TriMet, Portland, Oregons tri-county regional transit agency, announced5 this week it is cutting six police officer positions and shifting 1.8 million of its 16.2 million police budget to other community-based public safety efforts. It will launch community-wide listening sessions and create an expert advisory panel on how to provide bias-free transit security.TriMet will also begin piloting nonpolice solutions, such as mobile crisis intervention teams for mental and behavioral health issues.The changes came after an independent review board recently found a lack of accountability6 by its multi-agency Transit Police and after Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler yanked the citys officers7 from the transit agencys police force. In Philadelphia, transit police have begun using smartphones to stop fare evaders, a common problem that often leads to more serious offenses, Tom Nestel, chief of the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority SEPTA, tells Axios. How it works When someone jumps a turnstile, the cashier alerts a SEPTA officer, who downloads video footage of the offender and blasts it out to the cell phones of other SEPTA officers waiting at stations downstream for the train to arrive.If the accused gets defensive, the officers show them video proof, which Nestel called a tremendous de-escalation tool.Instead of a 300 penalty, fare-jumpers get a 25 fine and another chance. If theyre caught skipping the fare four times, theyre banned from the SEPTA system and funneled into social service agencies to help with underlying problems like poverty or drug addiction. The bottom line As with any beat officer, transit cops daily engagement with the people who pass through their stations can keep more serious problems at bay, says Nestel.  1  2  3  4  5  6  7",homeless
portland,"Oregon high school students to award $550,000 to 81 nonprofits through the CommuniCare grantmaking program",2021-06-14T00:00:00Z,MENAFN - Press Releases (English),KGW,"Student Grant makers distributing checks to nonprofits at the 2019 Grant Award Ceremony.Lillie S. and Violet W. at Grant High School celebrating the end of the year. During the fall and winter months students are challenged to raise up to 1,500, which is matched 101 by The CARE Foundation. Forty-seven grantmaking groups from 27 Oregon schools, totaling 900 students, spent the year becoming independent grantmakers - establishing their own mission statements , reviewing nonprofit applications, conducting interviews, and deciding which nonprofits will receive requested funds. In lieu of traditional in-person ceremonies, The CARE Foundation will host a virtual Grant Awards Ceremony this year to support social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic.The most rewarding part of CommuniCare has been getting to know more about my communitys health and, for once, actually being involved and feeling useful, said Adolfo B., a Creekside Community High School student participant. The grantmaking process has really enlightened me and has furthered my passion for wanting to help others any way I can.My late parents established this program 24 years ago. The idea was to help high school students become grantmakers and encourage them to learn about nonprofits and the needs in their community, said Jordan D. Schnitzer, Director of The Harold amp Arlene Schnitzer CARE Foundation. Giving back to the community is a critical part of life. We care about each other in our community. When you reach out and help others it makes the community a bigger and stronger place.CommuniCare will host a virtual grant awards ceremony on KGW Channel 8 on Thursday, June 17 from 800 p.m. - 830 p.m. with special guest appearances from Astoria High School, Grant High School, David Douglas High School, and Pendleton High School students and local nonprofits, including Latino Network, Ecology in Classrooms amp Outdoors ECO, and Project Pooch.We are so proud that every school rose to the challenge and was able to successfully complete the program remotely, said Kristen Engfors-Boess, CommuniCares Program Manager. The news over this past year has been headline after headline of national and global crises, and it can be easy to feel small compared to the challenges at hand. But CommuniCare is something concrete that students can do to affect change in their own neighborhoods - to make the world the kind of place they want to see.About CommuniCare and The Harold amp Arlene Schnitzer CARE Foundation Started by Harold and Arlene Schnitzer in 1997, the CommuniCare program channels The Harold amp Arlene Schnitzer CARE Foundations commitment to small, community giving into a school-based youth philanthropy program. Stewardship and education are of primary importance to Harold and Arlenes son, Jordan Schnitzer, who is honoring his parents legacy and commitment by expanding the CommuniCare program. The program challenges students to learn about the needs of their communities through grantmaking and emphasizes the importance of empathy, teamwork, problem-solving, and leadership. By challenging students to engage in community service that is both rewarding and educational, we hope to encourage them to become active adult citizens with a lifelong ethic of philanthropy.In its 24-year history, 3709 students have participated in the CommuniCare program, granting over 2,384,000 to 377 nonprofits and school programs. In addition to the Portland area school participants, CommuniCare programs are implemented in schools on Oregons North Coast and in Eastern Oregon.

The New York Times reported Hansjörg Wyss doled out the money from two of his organizations, a nonprofit fund and a foundation, to three other nonprofit funds that gave money to left-wing groups that assisted Democrats in their efforts to take back the White House and control Congress in 2020.

For example, one key recommendation to reduce smoke exposure is to go indoors into spaces that have lower fine particulate matter than outdoors. However, people have unequal access to this sort of space and some populations are particularly challenged to escape the smoke. Many peoples livelihoods depend on them working outdoors, including farmers, forest workers, those working in construction and landscaping, recreation and tourism, and wildland fire response. In addition, people who are unhoused may have little to no access to clean air during smoke events. Even for those who can go indoors, many houses, commercial establishments, and public buildings especially in lower income communities do not provide indoor air quality that is significantly better than outside, due to lack of filtration systems or poor insulation.

Half of all mosques are classified as radical by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution. Why are they allowed to operate? What does Austria gain by their presence, or by the presence of this supremacist and criminal migrant? Why do Austria and other European countries allow more supremacists and criminals among the migrants to enter the country every day?

There were numerous young people, many of whom ran off when the police turned up. The Covid regulations in Mallorca permit social gatherings of no more than six people indoors and eight people outdoors. Illegal parties, it has been said by the islands nightlife sector, are a consequence of restrictions that dont allow clubs to open at present. These parties, the sector has added, are potential sources of infection as there are no controls, whereas clubs are capable of ensuring controls. Last week, the Abone association, which represents nightlife businesses, sat down with the Balearic government and initiated talks designed to bring about a reopening and to establish new protocols for health control. The two sides hadnt talked for months. There is now a new board at Abone, and last weeks meeting was described as positive. 117 Spain New Catalan Leader Vows to Keep Up Independence Fight118 Moderate separatist leader Pere Aragones pledged to keep up Catalonias fight for independence as he was elected Friday president of the northern Spanish region which tried to break away four years ago, plunging the country into turmoil.

As the only Labor leader since 1974, he won parliamentary elections three times in a row 1997, 2001 and 2005. But the reality is different If the British left cannot stand someones name and hates someone to death, it is Blair.

There has been no reformation in Islam for over 1400 years it has become more dangerous today. That is all true, but to prove now that Saraswati was wrong and Islam is a religion of peace, Mohammed Jaan Dar and other Muslims want to behead him. Thatll show him. Repeat Of Kamlesh Tiwari?

portland,"You can work long, hard, or smart, but at Amazon.com you can't choose two out of three",2019-06-30T00:00:00Z,Dissident Voice,KGW,"Bezos acknowledges his high standards for employees every year, telling shareholders that its not easy to work here. In the 24 years since Amazon was founded, CEO Jeff Bezos has seen his company grow from a modest online bookshop to one of the most valuable companies in the world. Back in 1997, Bezos was already expecting big things out of his young company. In his annual letter to Amazon shareholders, Bezos described how much effort he expected from his employees. When I interview people I tell them, You can work long, hard, or smart, but at Amazon.com you cant choose two out of three, Bezos wrote in the 1997 letter. Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, the single most important element of Amazon.coms success. The New York Times4 reported in 2015 exactly how bruising the work environment at Amazon could be. Employees were reportedly expected to routinely work late, were encouraged to criticize coworkers ideas at meetings, and were often found crying at their desks. Amazon disputed many of the claims in the Times investigation, though the newspaper defended its reporting. God forbid we call Amazon Boss Bezos a plantation owner of a different mother, for sure. That Americans  living in small and large cities, far and wide  depend on the Amazon way as if Amazon is sutured into all aspects of American culture sic and hardwired into every new borns head. Same day delivery. A shopping cart that would be the envy of any Rothschild orLeona Mindy Roberts Helmsley5.This essay, first, was going to address those other masters of the Universe  Google Guys and Algorithm Titans. I barely criticized a billionaire in a DV article  Household Income, or Higher Planes of Consciousness?6 I criticized Nick Hanauer for his false balance, contrived bifurcation, and his new wind as a billionaire fighting what he calls the educationalism mindset that says that a good, grounded, deep and holistic education might be a thing of kings, whereas Nick says education backing and financing aint worth diddly squat in capitalism until more people make more money to buy more things, or just to survive in his nihilistic world. Taken with this story line, I embraced education as both a philanthropic cause and a civic mission. I co-founded the League of Education Voters, a nonprofit dedicated to improving public education. I joined Bill Gates, Alice Walton, and Paul Allen in giving more than 1 million each to an effort to pass a ballot measure that established Washington States first charter schools. All told, I have devoted countless hours and millions of dollars to the simple idea that if we improved our schoolsif we modernized our curricula and our teaching methods, substantially increased school funding, rooted out bad teachers, and opened enough charter schoolsAmerican children, especially those in low-income and working-class communities, would start learning again. Graduation rates and wages would increase, poverty and inequality would decrease, and public commitment to democracy would be restored.  Nick Hanauer In my email box, Google, of course, I get an unsolicited email from an organization for which I have never associated with or even pursued. Its the old surveillance state of Google and the internet Stasi, for sure Alas, Neil Postman was correct, in so far as what we say and do as writers really does not count  we are only as smart and deep and truthful as our masters will allow In my college economics class, we were taught that wages depend on productivity. The more productive or skilled workers are, my professors used to argue, the more they will be worth on the labor market and, therefore, the higher their wages will be. Thats bunk. Under this logic, the way to cure our economic woes - whether poverty, inequality, underemployment, or unemployment - is through education. By educating our citizens, we increase their human capital, making them more productive and, therefore, increasing their expected income. It sounds good, right? This seductive myth - of education as an economic cure-all - is something Civic Action founder Nick Hanauer calls educationism. As Nick writes in a recent article for The Atlantic, its a myth he used to believe, and its a myth many wealthy elites still propagate. Its what leads philanthropists to donate billions of dollars to public schools and educational institutions. Theres just one problem Educationism doesnt work. If it did, our middle class would be much better off. In the last 40 years, while the real incomes of most Americans have been stuck, weve gotten a lot more educated. Almost everyone has a high school diploma and the share of Americans with a college degree has more than tripled since 1970. But all that education hasnt translated into higher wages. In fact, if our incomes had done what my college profs told me - gone up with productivity - the average family today would be earning 29,000 more a year. An average of 105,000! Of course, its true that getting an education is likely to increase your own income. But thats not the same as raising incomes throughout the economy. Not when four out of five of the fastest growing jobs pay very low wages - jobs like cashiers and health care assistants. Meanwhile, the pay of most people who do have a college education barely keeps up with inflation. What we do need to do is raise incomes for working families and the middle class throughout the economy. Thats how we build an economy that works for all of us, not just the wealthy few. As Nick writes In short, great public schools are the product of a thriving middle class, not the other way around. Pay people enough to afford dignified middle-class lives, and high-quality public schools will follow. But allow economic inequality to grow, and educational inequality will inevitably grow with it.  Stephen Paolini, Civic Action, email with an ask for  support But then, this essay takes a twist, as they always seem to do when I deploy some ground-truthing. You see, most of us in the USA, the 80 percent of the population  many of which are on the skids, on the near skids, or those of us barely scraping by, and those of us who are unseen but are many short steps away from working for one of those sweatshops like we see with Amazon there are so many warehouse jobs, forklift gigs, sorting careers and finding down time in the back seat of our cars  so-so tire of, really, the prognosticators writing away hard in semi-secure status  even the smartish ones on leftish magazines like The Nation, or digital forums like Truthout or Truthdig or The Intercept. They have NO idea of what is real in the world, and that rarefied realm of citing this study or making this or that prediction, well, it is bombast at best, propaganda at worst, denuded of humanity in many cases. Case in point  tens of millions of men and women wandering the land US, in some warped version of Steinbecks Grapes of Wrath, really, in a society that eats-sleeps-dreams-believes the crap that Huxley warned of, and that which Neil Postman discussed. Oh the irony, those, that billionaire book salesman, Bezos, dead to the world, dead to us, the 80 percent, living, barely, in the middle of their hellish barbecue. I was with three fellows  two literally are sleeping in campgrounds, and one fellow living with his parents. A million miles away from what any social worker or Sheryl Sandberg or Joe Biden or Elizabeth Warren or any of the scions of Holly-dirt or anyone in the Trump Loony Bin Show, or those clamoring around an Obama or Oprah or Rachel Maddow. Its a triple sick experience even thinking about how vapid that so-called debate was yesterday with half of the half-wits of the Democratic Party wanting to play president. So, a life of men truly on the extinction block, in several demographics. These fellows I hired on to help my spouse and I move from a rental to a house we had the temerity to purchase in a Time of Climate Heating, Oceans Rising, Food Wilting, Water Draining, Economies Imploding, Saber Rattling, and ICBM Immolating. Their lives, broken down, seem to hold the familiar life story of many people I have worked with as a non-traditional social worker for the homeless, the just-out-of-prison returnees, and chronically physically and mentally ill. They work jobs, stacking halibut, packing shrimp, pounding two-by-fours, hauling goods, sorting things, cutting trees, landscaping, roofing. Both of these fellows are 50, living in campgrounds, one with false teeth, the other with nubs and rotting teeth. Child support for children they have never seen, or cant see now. Felonies for this or that charge keeping them from even getting to first base on an apartment application. Vagabonds harassed by cops, and living life in a constant move. For my other helper, Brian, hes a former marine, working as a social services provider, has a wonderful child on the spectrum autism and is currently living with aging and sickly parents. All three fit the bill for zero tolerance in this society. Never reflected in the news stories, in the Mass Murdering Media, never on the minds of the One Percent, Point Zero Zero One Percent. I know for a fact, though, that those Little Eichmanns who populate the other 19 percent of the 20 Percenters, well, many of them have one degree of separation when it comes to family members with substance abuse issues, chronic mental or physical illness, depression, suicidal, schizophrenic, and homeless. You get both barrels of human pain and human survival and some human triumphs when talking with real people, albeit, denigrated folk, disenfranchised humans. They are really rough around the edges, but these fellows, Tommy and Devon, they are examples of struggle and defeat and some triumph, as Brian and I note and agree. They are so far from any of the discourse going on around the world  the complete irrelevance of all the trolling, all the internet crap, all the stuff that makes for an echo chamber that sucks humanity and human connection from the ether. You look at Tommy, and you see a man on the skids. Big laughing screwed up face, almost Dickensian, crazy might be one moniker. Hustling and wanting to have people know that there was once a time when he had some normalcy, some sense of being a man in society  not on the skids. Though, Tommy would not see himself on the skids. Brain injury 23 years ago when a van hit him head on as a pedestrian. And he still works, moves heavy furniture, and hammers roofs. Devon, a former truck driver, someone who has a few years in the Marines, and as Brian states  people are only awakened to the level of how they have been able to access those tools necessary to be woken up. Yet, Brian states that hed much rather be in the company of these men than the MSWs and other graduate-level punishers hes worked with, as I have also worked with, in the non-profit arenas as supposed social services workers. They probably know nothing about this movement, which could affect Tommy and Devon When reporters for theInternational Amazon Workers7 Voiceinterviewed part-time Amazon associates a cheap euphemism for employees used to disguise the exploitative relationship between workers and management at the company in Baltimore to discuss their attitude toward Bezos fortune, they were met with a torrent of disgust, calls for sharing the wealth, and social anger. Tell Mr. Bezos and the rest of management to come out of their offices and get on the shop floor said one worker who identified herself as a single mother of two. At the end of the day, they never feel what we go through in a day for 12 an hour. They get to sit down in their offices and get paid more than we will see in a year, she said. Bezos wealth typifies the way an increasingly small number of multi-billionaire CEOs and finance operatives extract ever more obscene sums from the international workforce. This process of ever-increasing wealth for the few and exploitation for the majority is reaching a political breaking point. Explaining her work environment during the holidays, the working mother said, they just had us move 100,000 packages in 5 hours, and at the end we arent even paid enough to take care of our kids. Im a single mother, I dont receive food stamps. My rent is 850 a month. I have to pay for gas, electricity, bus passes, plus raise two kids. If we decided to quit, who would move these packages out of the door? she said, noting the social power of the workers employed by the company. We are the ones making you rich. Brian and I talk about Amazon, and the nefarious nature of how the guy at the Washington Post attacks the fourth grader Trump and others, while he is part of the Military Industrial Complex. From The Intercept8 Amazons extensive relationship with the NSA, FBI, Pentagon and other surveillance agencies in the west is multi-faceted, highly lucrative and rapidly growing. Last March, the Interceptreported on a new app9that Amazon developers and British police forces have jointly developed to use on the public in police work, just the latest example of third partiesaiding10,automating11, and in some cases,replacing12, the functions of law enforcement agencies  and raises privacyquestions13about Amazons role as an intermediary. Then theres the patent Amazon obtained last October,as reported by the Intercept14, that would allow its virtual assistant Alexa to decipher a users physical characteristics and emotional state based on their voice. In particular, it would enable anyone using the product to determine a persons accent and likely place of origin The algorithm would alsoconsider a customers physical location  based on their IP address, primary shipping address, and browser settings  to help determine their accent. All of this is taking place as Amazon vies for, and is the favorite to win, one of the largest Pentagon contracts yet a 10 billion agreement to provide exclusive cloud services to the worlds largest military. CNN reported just last week that the company is now enmeshed in scandal over that effort,specifically aformal investigation15into whether Amazon improperly hired a former Defense Department worker who was involved with a 10 billion government contract for which the tech company iscompeting. Bezos relationship with the military and spying agencies of the U.S. Government, and law enforcement agencies around the world, predates his purchase of the Washington Post and has become a central prong of Amazons business growth. Back in 2014, Amazon secureda massive contract with the CIA16when the spy agency agreed to pay it 600 million for computing cloud software. As the Atlantic noted at the time, Amazons software will begin servicing all 17 agencies that make up the intelligence community. Given how vital the military and spy agencies now are to Amazons business, its unsurprising that the amountAmazon pays to lobbyists17to serve its interests in Washington has exploded quadrupling since 2013from 3 million to almost 15 million last year, according to Open Secrets. What would the house-less Tommy and Devon say about this Byzantine world of hyper billions of dollars and hyper trillions of human hours wasted on the things of capitalism, of power and control, consumption?I know many friends who wonder why we  people like me  still live in the US? Many wonder what it will take young people to stand down the systems of oppression. Some believe the young people have it, as in Greta the Carbon Dioxide Robin Hood, or AOC, the new face sic of American politics. This system we have now is one where a few voices count get read, heard, published, followed, and the majority of voices are just bursts of yelling in the woods, in campgrounds, in ones lovely home in the old sedan, in our own bedlam. People travelling from one insane place to another, but in that realm, a sanity sets in for guys like Tommy and Devon. The world is pretty clear-cut, and on many levels, these people have positive outlooks  toothless, no real estate or swelling investment accounts. Just that hard way forward. Cigarettes and bicycling miles a day. Places to shower. Places to get out of the rain without the bulldozers of misanthropy pushing them further and further into ditches or out on the periphery until they stare us all down, face to face, the coming of a New Brave World. Is it the entertaining ourselves to death cycle, or a little bit of the other  big brother, watching our every move, holding every syllable mouthed in a cloud server, every speck of mole cataloged, and every word penned or typed, collected to hold us at bay, hold us as prisoners of our own faulty beliefs? Needless to say, Charles Dickens18 grew to hate the system and rail against it in his works. In his seminal novella A Christmas Carol, Ebenezer Scrooge is visited by two portly men raising money for the poor. At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge, said the one of the gentlemen, taking up a pen, it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the Poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at the present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir. Are there no prisons? asked Scrooge. Plenty of prisons, said the gentleman, laying down the pen again. And the Union workhouses? demanded Scrooge. Are they still in operation? They are. Still, returned the gentleman, I wish I could say they were not. The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then? said Scrooge. Both very busy, sir. Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had occurred to stop them in their useful course, said Scrooge. Im very glad to hear it. Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude, returned the gentleman, a few of us are endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and means of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time, of all others, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I put you down for? Nothing! Scrooge replied. You wish to be anonymous? I wish to be left alone, said Scrooge. Since you ask me what I wish, gentlemen, that is my answer. I dont make merry myself at Christmas and I cant afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the establishments I have mentioned they cost enough and those who are badly off must go there. Many cant go there and many would rather die. If they would rather die, said Scrooge, they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.  Charles Dickens, 1843, A ChristmasCarol Or, updated for 2020, as illustrated by a commentator on an article about Portland, OR, once the Rose City, now The City of Rocks To disrupt illegal camp sites set up by homeless in Portland, the Oregon Department of Transportation ODOT is moving boulders onto the roadsides. The project will eventually cost about a million dollars, but ODOT argues this cost is less than the cost of dealing with existing campsites. Many have pointed out that this policy does nothing to address the underlying problem or help the people in the camp, but only forces them to move somewhere else.

Dane County Circuit Judge Valerie Bailey-Rihn expressed disbelief that she had to issue such an order but emphasized it was necessary because the inquiry is being led by former state Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman, whose team has said they destroyed unimportant documents. 76 Biden Disinformation Czar Nina Jankowicz Critical Race Theory a Sign of Republicans Weaponizing Emotions77 The Biden administrations disinformation czar dismissed parental concerns about critical race theory in an October speech, saying it was merely the GOP weaponizing peoples emotion. Nina Jankowicz made the comments during an October speech before the City Club of Cleveland in Ohio. Her speech was titled Disinformation and Democracy Civic Discourse in the Digital Age. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas tapped Jankowicz to lead the departments new disinformation board last week, a choice that has led to intense scrutiny. 78 Boeing Moving Corporate Headquarters to Arlington, Va. From Chicago79 Aerospace giant Boeing is moving its global headquarters to Arlington, Virginia, from Chicago and is creating a research and technology hub in the D.C. region, the company announced Thursday. Boeing President and CEO Dave Calhoun said the move will put corporate workers in close proximity to key government and military stakeholders. Itll also better position the company  which is the U.S.s largest exporter employing 140,000 people  to attract world-class engineering and technical talent, Calhoun said in a statement. Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, and Democratic Sen. Mark Warner have been working on the deal for some time. Warner said he started conversations last year and Youngkin has a personal relationship with Calhoun, a Virginia state official said. A large incentive package was not involved in the relocation discussions, this official said. 80 Breaking Andy Ngo Reaches 1 Million Followers on Twitter Despite Antifa Attacks, Censorship81 On Thursday, The Post Millennial editor-at-large Andy Ngo reached 1 million followers on Twitter, reaching the loft the number despite years of attacks for his journalistic endeavors. In a comment regarding the achievement, Ngo told The Post Millennial Those who feel threatened by my journalism have crowd sourced campaigns to intimidate me into silence through mass harassment and death threats. When that failed, they escalated to lawfare, going so far as filing a frivolous federal lawsuit against me for using the retweeting feature. On top of all of this, I have experienced unfair treatment from Twitter itself through being shadowbanned and search banned at various times. 82 Breaking Woke Educators Sued Over Surveillance Dossier on Scottsdale Parents Concerned About Mandates, CRT83 On Thursday, Harmeet Dhillon announced that a lawsuit has been brought against the Scottsdale Unified School District and others within the district that spied on and created a dossier regarding parents that advocated for in-person learning and transparency.

The survey finds that Musk buying the tech giant doesnt matter to 62 of registered voters, including 43 who say it doesnt matter at all. 90 Google Expanded Its Censorship of COVID, Election, And Climate-Related Ads, Demonetizing False Claims91 Google has published its 2021 Ads Safety Report, revealing that in order to prevent malicious use of the ads platform, it last year removed more than 3.4 billion ads, restricted more than 5.7 billion, and suspended in excess of 5.6 million advertiser accounts. Google claims it is user safety that is their top priority when deciding about ads  the very core of the trillion-dollar empire  and monetized content. Some new elements of the policy around ads introduced in 2021 include a multi-strikes system for what Google decides are policy violations, and at the same time, more than 30 policies for advertisers and publishers were either added, or updated last year. 92 Homeland Security Republicans Seek Info on Mayorkas Disinfo Board, Demand List of Social Media Companies93 EXCLUSIVE Republicans on the House Homeland Security Committee are demanding more details on the Biden administrations recently announced Disinformation Governance Board amid concerns about free speech protections. Writing to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas with sincere concern Thursday, the 13 Republican members of the committee demanded Mayorkas provide basic information to the committee including the disinformation boards organization, members, schedule and recommendations. They also scolded Mayorkas for a confusing rollout of the board, according to the letter first obtained by Fox News Digital. 94 Judge Rules Cops Who Arrested Man Over Parody Facebook Page Have Qualified Immunity95 Free speech and whats known as qualified immunity, as well as overcriminalization  expansion of the criminal code in the US to address even minor problems in society  is at the heart of a case that started in 2016 with a short-lived parody page Anthony Novak had set up on Facebook. Novak was subsequently arrested and spent several days in jail  much longer than the lifespan of his page critical of the police in Parma, Ohio  a page that was up only 12 hours. 96 Lawmakers Send Gov.

His wife was treated for her injuries at St. Thomas Rutherford Hospital.. 102 Police Damage Done by Some During Otherwise Peaceful Demonstration103 PORTLAND, Oregon  Damage caused during abortion rights rally in downtown Portland marred an otherwise peaceful event Tuesday evening. The damage was not as widespread as some instances in the past, but any damage is tough for a downtown trying to make a comeback. This time there was graffiti and broken glass, and some burning items thrown at the Mark O. Hatfield federal courthouse in downtown Portland. 104 Ron DeSantis Bests Joe Biden by 11 Points in Prospective Poll of 2024105 Trump led Biden by 14, meanwhile. Gov. Ron DeSantis keeps saying he has no plans to run for President in 2024, but one poll says hed win the popular vote in a landslide against the current incumbent. A survey released Thursday by Rasmussen Reports shows the Florida Governor commanding 46 support against 35 for Democrat Joe Biden. An additional 11 said theyd vote for someone else, and 2 said they wouldnt vote. 106 Shaun King Group Heavily Involved in Efforts to Save Far-Left San Francisco DA Boudin From Recall Election107 A group co-founded by Black Lives Matter activist Shaun King is heavily involved in saving far-left San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin from his June 7 recall election. The Real Justice PAC, co-founded by King, is working overtime to ensure Boudin remains in office as critics seek to oust him over what they say is his lack of criminal enforcement and failure to make San Francisco safe. King and individuals associated with Real Justice have a vested interest in the controversial DA through a separate and little-known group called the Grassroots Law Project, which was co-created by King and houses a criminal justice campaign involving Boudin. 108 Staten Island DA Purchased Controversial Social Media Facial Recognition Software109 Controversy-riddled Clearview AI facial recognition system has been used, and paid for, by Staten Islands district attorney in some also fairly controversial ways, the Intercept claims, basing its report on city records. The information, obtained via the Legal Aid Society and Freedom of Information requests show that despite its notoriety, the use of Clearview by prosecutors in this New York City borough has been largely unsupervised. It is also said that the Staten Island District Attorneys Office stopped using the technology last year. 110 Trump Reacts to Bidens MAGA Criticism, Says Movement Saving America111 EXCLUSIVE Former President Trump on Thursday told Fox News Digital that MAGA is saving America, and slammed President Biden for being divisive when he called MAGA the most extreme political organization thats existed in recent American history. MAGA is saving America, Trump told Fox News. Our country is going to hell. MAGA is saving America. 112 Trumps Endorsement Power Was Evident in Ohio and Indiana  Though There Are Limits113 Republican candidates backed by former President Donald Trump had a good night in Ohio and Indiana primaries Tuesday night. Many of these candidates are younger and likely to make it to Congress  and if more of them win elsewhere this year, this cycle could represent something of a bridge to Trumpism, even post-Trump. They are examples of the potentially lasting effects of how Trump has changed GOP politics  although there are limits to his influence. Pro-Trump candidates continued to do best in rural areas, underscoring where his power is concentrated, but there remains a question of how well Trumpism can do in swing areas. In the more short term  and something worth tracking  there was an indication that Republican enthusiasm is up, while Democrats is down. Thats evident in how much GOP turnout rose, compared with the 2018 primaries. 114 Victims of Communism Day Legislation on Gov. Desantis Desk for Signature115 The legislation sets aside a remembrance day and requires students learn the human cost of communism. Legislation that requires students to learn about the suffering inflicted by communism was one of 17 bills that landed on Gov. Ron DeSantis desk Thursday. With the Governors signature, he and succeeding Governors would declare Nov. 7 Victims of Communism Day. That is the anniversary of the day in 1917 when Vladimir Lenin stormed the Russian capital to overthrow the government. It ignited a worldwide movement. The bill called for honoring the 100 million victims of communist regimes around the world. 116 Video Rand Paul Grills DHS Head on Creepy Ministry of Truth117 Senator Rand Paul grilled Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on the recently announced disinformation governance board Wednesday, noting that there isnt even an agreement of what disinformation is and that the government has a long history of propagating it. Paul questioned Mayorkas on the new board, which has been dubbed a Ministry of Truth by critics, referencing George Orwells 1984. The Senator asked the DHS head Do you think the Steele dossier included Russian disinformation? prompting Mayorkas to answer that he is not equipped to answer that. 118 Canadians Should be Informed if Their Data is Being Collected by Feds Committee119 The House of Commons ethics committee wants the federal government to inform Canadians if theyre being spied on and to give them the option to opt out of data-collection surveillance programs. The recommendations come as parliamentarians probe the Public Health Agency of Canada PHAC secretly spying on the locations of millions of Canadians. Last year it was revealed that the federal department obtained data from 33 million devices to conduct population mobility patterns research during lockdowns. 120 Did a B.C. Elementary School Seriously Just Cancel Mothers Day?121 A child may be confused as to whether there is something wrong with traditional celebrations of honouring mothers this time of year, as schools move to replace Mothers Day with, or celebrate it along with Grown Ups Who Love Us Day. As reported in the Western Standard, parents reported that Centennial Park Elementary had cancelled the schools traditional celebrations of Mothers Day, and replaced it with the new inclusive celebration. When the Western Standard reached out to get more clarification on the decision from Kari Petzold, including inquiring as to whether children will be permitted to make Mothers Day cards in school this year, the Petzold refused to comment, stating like I said, no comment. It has nothing to do with you. 122 Edmonton Pastor Found Guilty of Obstructing Public Health Inspector123 Pastor Tracy Fortin and Church in the Vine were convicted Wednesday of three counts each of breaching Section 71 of the Alberta Public Health Act by obstructing an inspector. Tracy admitted during trial that she prevented a health inspector from disrupting Sunday worship services to inspect for compliance with Alberta government COVID-19 restrictions on places of worship. 124 Federal Government Cracking Down on Freedom of the Press125 Justin Trudeau and the federal government often boast about the level of press freedom in Canada. Taking no responsibility for their own censorship efforts, the Liberal Party of Canada and their media allies have actually aimed the blame at peaceful protesters for making journalists feel uncomfortable. On last nights episode of The Ezra Levant Show, we examined the current state of press freedom in Canada, and looked back at eight examples of the federal governments heavy-handed measures to clamp down on our journalism. 126 Petition Help Us Fight the Digital Surveillance State127 We can see that health restrictions are slowly being dropped and that theres a certain return to normalcy. Unfortunately, a bigger problem is headed our way  one that will allow the government to know everything about us. Im of course talking about digital identities. Oddly enough, at the federal level, the application created to gather your information uses QR codes. Was the vaccine passport just a test to this more complex version? Were launching a petition to send a message to the government that citizens refuse to be tracked and that they want to keep their freedoms and rights as Canadians. Quebec might be one of the first provinces to move forward with this technology, but lets not wait for it to become a national thing. If digital identities come into play, life as weve known it will never be the same again! We must take action! Sign the petition at StopDigitalID.com in large numbers, and we will deliver it to the government to send a message that Canadians are opposed to a digital surveillance state. 128 YouTube Warns Bill C-11 Lets Feds Censor Everyday Content129 YouTube officials have warned that if Prime Minister Justin Trudeaus internet regulation bill goes through, it could give the government unprecedented power over everyday content posted online. According to YouTube Canadas head of government affairs Janette Patell, Bill C-11s wording is so broad that it places home videos within the purview of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission CRTC. Despite claims by the Trudeau government that the law would exclude ordinary videos, several experts have blasted the update to the Broadcasting Act as an affront to freedom of expression. 130 Blackout of Homes, Factories French Prosecutors Find Far-Left Extremists Main Suspects in Power Line Attack131 French prosecutors in Grenoble have identified far-left extremists as the most likely suspects in the sabotage of an electrical line on a bridge that was damaged by arson last month. The arson attack on the Brignoud bridge, which crosses the Isre river near the city of Grenoble, took place last month in April and led to over 5,500 people in the nearby commune of Villard-Bonnot going without power as the bridge contained electrical power lines that were damaged as a result of the fire. 132 Czechia The Children of the Wind Camp Out in Brno133 A group of several dozen Roma camps are situated in front of the railway station in the Czech town of Brno and officials do not know what to do with them. The Roma allegedly refuse the governments offered accommodation, and while a place for them may be found eventually, this group of people often presents a serious problem. They probably speak Hungarian and Romani, perhaps some Ukrainian, and often have dual Hungarian and Ukrainian citizenship. These are people for whom nationality is a strange concept, something that is forced on them or provided by a state. The state, like citizenship, is something beyond their imagination and certainly nothing they desire. They live in their own state, Romastan, which has no borders and is where they decide to go whenever possible. They are, therefore, poetically called the children of the wind. 134 Germany Serious Adverse Jab Reactions 40 Times Higher Than Previously Reported135 A German study has found that the number of serious side effects after Corona vaccines was 40 times higher than previously reported. The Charit, a well-known hospital in Berlin, interviewed 40 000 vaccinated people after they had received their mandated jabs. 136 Germany As Berlin Housing Crisis Grows, One Housing Association Pushes a Dramatic Solution137 The association of Berlin-Brandenburg housing companies BBU has proposed a legal limitation on living space for individuals at a time when the city, just like the rest of Europe, is struggling with a continuing housing crisis. It is not possible for us to complain about shortages while, at the same time, the living space per capita in many places continues to increase, said association leader Maren Kern on Wednesday. What would these proposed restrictions look like? In essence, they would force people who live in bigger spaces to move to smaller spaces or pay an extra tax, at least for those people renting from the various housing companies and cooperatives in the city. 138 Hungary Will Veto EUs Energy Sanctions Against Russia139 Hungary will veto the European Unions planned sixth round of sanctions against Russia, which includes a halt to oil imports by the end of the year, government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said on Wednesday. Asked by the BBC whether Hungary will exercise its veto, Kovacs said, In short, yes, but you also need to know how the European Union works. The proposal comes from Brussels that is, from the administrative, bureaucratic center of the European Union  not from the member states. They know exactly that what they are proposing is contrary to Hungarian interests, and if we support it, we will completely destroy the Hungarian economy.  140 New Information  Sweden Can Become a NATO Member in Just Two Weeks141 According to new information published by a Norwegian source, Swedens and Finlands application to NATO, which is becoming increasingly likely, can take place in a record time of just two weeks. The newspaper Verdens Gang, quoted Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, who confirmed that the application would be handled with the shortest possible lead time. It is about not making that period longer than necessary, said the Norwegian Prime Minister. Over the years, several NATO secretaries have said that Sweden would be able to gain membership in NATO quite easily, something that the current Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has confirmed. 142 Romanias Top Court Bans Hungarian-Language Catholic School143 The Romanian Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that the Roman Catholic School in Marosvasarhely, central Transylvania is functioning under an unconstitutional license, thereby effectively ordering it to be closed.

But every time the IHS worker came by, the homeless people had already moved on, only to come back later. Shes never been able to make contact with them because by the time she comes out, theyre gone, Gonzalez said. It would definitely help if there were someone who could respond quicker. Theyd reach them and be able to have a dialogue. Police are often called on to address complaints about homelessness and mental illness.Cory LumCivil Beat Honolulu lacks a crisis response team that can be dispatched immediately to address mental health crises and behavioral health issues. Instead, the task often falls to a patchwork of social services providers whose work is supported by temporary grants. Or to Honolulu police officers, most of whom are not trained in crisis intervention or de-escalation for the mentally ill. Behavioral health calls make up 10 to 30 of HPDs call volume, the department said. A growing number of American cities are embracing another way sending mental health first responders instead of police. The teams are made up of unarmed crisis workers, such as social workers and health care personnel, who advocates say are better equipped than police to handle cases that dont involve violence or crime. The concept was pioneered in Eugene, Oregon, more than 30 years ago. CAHOOTS - or Crisis Assistance Helping Out On The Streets - is embedded in the areas 911 system. Dispatchers who receive calls about mental health crises, homelessness, substance abuse and other welfare checks direct the information to CAHOOTS. On a fundamental level, the CAHOOTS program is designed to send the right kind of first responders into emergent crisis situations where theres not a crime being committed, theres no medical emergency, no fire to be put out, but where there is still somebody whos in profound need, said Tim Black, the consulting director of the White Bird Clinic, which runs CAHOOTS1. CAHOOTS team members help deescalate conflict, refer individuals to services and even transport them to shelters, stabilization sites or medical clinics - avoiding unnecessary stays in jail or the emergency room, Black said. Outreach workers in Honolulu are not embedded into the 911 system. In Eugene, Oregon, theyre treated like other first responders.Courtesy oF Chad Koyanagi The program handles about 17 of the Eugene Police Departments call volume every year, which saves the police department an estimated 8.5 million annually, according to the White Bird Clinic. CAHOOTS budget is only 2.1 million. The team can always call for backup if workers need police assistance - theyre on the police radio system - but those occasions are rare. Of the 24,000 calls CAHOOTS responded to in 2019, only 360, or 1.5, required police backup, Black said. Half of those cases only required police to conduct an involuntary psychiatric hold. Interaction with CAHOOTS is voluntary, Black said. We enter into our interactions with community members on a foundation of mutual trust and with an objective of the least intervention necessary to find immediate de-escalation and stabilization, Black said. Thats different from an officer who was trained through the academy, and this mentality is ingrained in them as a patrol officer, that they are a warrior and that they need to assume that every interaction they have with a community member could potentially become fatal, and to assumethat it will become violent and potentially fatal. Cities across the country are increasingly adopting the CAHOOTS model2. It has gained particular momentum in the last year as protests nationwide have called for police reform, including shifting police responsibilities and resources toward social services agencies. San Francisco3 recently started sending personnel from its health and fire departments to behavioral health crises in lieu of police. New York City4 announced last week that it plans to pilot the concept in Harlem and East Harlem, areas that produce the most mental-health related emergency calls. Denver5 started a similar program last summer. Around the same time, Albuquerque, New Mexico6created a new city department to pursue the idea. Orlando, Florida7launched its mental health team this month, as did Portland, Oregon8. Theres even federal legislation9 aimed at helping states adopt the CAHOOTS model, introduced by senators from Oregon and Nevada, and legislators are working to include a pared down version of that bill in the upcoming COVID-19 relief package10. Several mental health advocates in Honolulu told Civil Beat its a concept the city should consider. People who are having mental health problems are generally not criminals, said Marya Grambs, a longtime advocate for mental health and people experiencing homelessness. While they may be breaking some kind of misdemeanors, being a nuisance or behaving oddly, theyre generally not committing crimes. But their behavior can be very disconcerting and unpleasant. But thats not the kind of thing police are really trained to handle. Thats not what their job description is.They Have The Skills Honolulu Police Chief Susan Ballard is open to the idea of handing some police responsibilities to social workers. Following Black Lives Matter protests last year, the chief said at a press conference she agreed with activists that society relies too much on the police to address social ills. HPD should not be the primary respondents to matters involving homelessness and mental illness, she said. Honolulu Police Department Chief Susan Ballard has lamented the fact that handling homelessness and mental illness has become a police responsibility.Cory LumCivil Beat Those are all social issues that should be handled elsewhere, she said. Unfortunately when nobody else steps up, and there is nowhere else to turn to, people always turn to the police to take care of whatever the problem is. Ballard said she would much prefer social workers to take homelessness and mental illness off her departments plate. I think it would be fantastic because they have the skills, she said. Ballard declined to be interviewed for this story. In a statement, she said HPD has advocated for the involvement of social services providers and the department is open to finding alternate ways of responding to scenes. While we have looked at the programs being used in other cities and reached out to different agencies, we are not starting our own program at this time due to the pandemic and fiscal constraints, she said. However, replacing police with unarmed crisis responders has the potential to save money, according to CAHOOTS. Beyond reducing the police departments call volume, the White Bird Clinic estimates it saved over 14 million for ambulance rides and emergency room visits in 2018. Honolulu started training officers in crisis intervention11 in recent years, but only 58 officers have completed the training so far, according to the departments latest strategic planning update. The pandemic interrupted an effort to train more officers, the department said. The department also runs the Health Efficiency Long-term Partnerships program, which pairs officers with homeless outreach workers to help connect unsheltered people to services.Could Honolulu Adopt This Model?Police responses to mental and behavioral health callscan sometimes devolve into violence or even death. Mental health cases make up 13 of use-of-force incidents, according to the Honolulu Police Departments latest force report12. And in recent years, incidents in which island police injured or killed a person in mental distress have made headlines. Honolulu lacks stabilization beds and affordable housing.Cory LumCivil Beat That includes a Waipahu man with schizophrenia who was killed by police in 201313, a man on methamphetamine who died in 2015 14after officers pepper-sprayed him and shot him with a Taser and a man who suffered from paranoia killed by police in 201715 after he allegedly threatened officers with a knife. Even in a CAHOOTS model, police would still need to respond to situations involving a weapon or aggressive behavior, but Black said crisis workers do sometimes respond in tandem with police to help with deescalation. In Alameda County, California, which started a modified version of CAHOOTS last year, the crisis workers respond alongside police officers. That collaboration is important for the safety of the mental health responders, according to Karl Sporer, the countys emergency medical services director. My concern is everyone is jumping on the bandwagon of trying to take PD out of this equation, and there will be people who will get hurt who work for me, he said. Some mental health advocates in Honolulu also expressed support for the CAHOOTS concept but were concerned about crisis responder safety. Its definitely a good option to explore, said Alicia Rodriguez, a former HPD psychologist who is now in private practice. The hard thing is it can go from zero to 60 really quick and a crisis worker isnt comfortable with that. Another challenge in Honolulu is the lack of stabilization facilities and affordable housing for people in crisis, according to several advocates. So even if crisis workers were able to calm people down and get them to accept help, there are few places to bring them for long-term care. We dont have anywhere to take them, said Kumi Macdonald, executive director of the National Alliance for Mental Illness Hawaii. There really are no stabilization beds. There really is no place for them to go If we dont have a stabilization center, we cant really do this project. CAHOOTS strength is in being a facilitator for people in crisis, Black said. But without a place to bring people that will address their needs, the program would fail. The only reason that CAHOOTS is as successful as we are keeping folks away from jail or out of the hospital is because we have a network of other resources in our community to rely on, Black said. If we didnt have those other resources available, we would just be helping cycle people through the hospital, and folks would still be going to jail. If a community like Honolulu is really considering mobile crisis response inspired by CAHOOTS, there also really needs to be an evaluation of what resources are lacking in the community for folks in crisis.

Initial reports said the woman did not have life-threatening injuries. However, police said she took a turn for the worse and later died. I have written many articles about Portlands leaders warped perspectives especially anti-cop Mayor Ted Wheeler3, Americas second worst mayor when dealing with many public safety issues for which there are destructive consequences. City leaders tolerance for so-called homeless crimes, including trespassing, which this womanwas doing, is infamous.

There was the man sleeping under a tarp near a trash dumpster in early December 2019 when a garbage truck ran over his legs4. The man was hospitalized with serious injuries but survived. In November 2019, a driver struck a woman5 who was sleeping in a tent, illegally trespassing on a grassy area near a Portland freeway off-ramp. The driver, who police say was not impaired and was cooperative, said shed 8216misjudged the curve8217 and drove off the road and onto the grassy area. The camper was hospitalized with significant leg injuries. She is expected to recover. Police cited the driver for Careless Driving6, a traffic infraction. It seemed lost on the woman camper that shed contributed to the circumstances by sleeping in an area where camping is prohibited by the statebecause of the danger.

Oregon Department of Transportation ODOT spokesman Lou Torres 8216reiterated the agencys longtime stance on keeping campers off highway-adjacent land.

Was it the chant they learned at the city-endorsed Antifa summer camp5 - The whole damn system is guilty as hell!? Or perhaps it was a sing-along to the old chestnut, Im gonna tell all you fascists, you may be surprised! People all over this world are getting organized! No. Considering that protesting is encouraged and rewarded in Portland schools by their Antifa-friendly teachers, the school pandemic protest was, in a word, unexpected. Two hundred Grant High School students bravely and selflessly cut class to attend a rally in favor of forcing vaccination mandates on students. Said one student interviewed by KGW-TV6, This vaccine has been shown to be 95 effective in preventing severe illness, even with the delta variant, even in the present day. And it presents an opportunity for us to be safer in the classroom. Poor little tykes. They apparently dont know that the children their age already have a nearly 100 COVID survival rate according to the CDC.7 ... Students are spoon-fed critical racist training all day long, but statistics and science? Naw. Theyll fit into future Portland protest culture beautifully. Meanwhile, as with other West Coast cities, police are working overtime in Portland  due to defunding and pandemic mandate firings  to solve the 19 shootings over the weekends. ... Its this kind of clueless West Coast leadership which has thrust Portland into a public relations nightmare. You might want to take a seat and brace yourself for this news. It turns out when a city has increasing violence, the aforesaid clueless leadership, Antifa rioters, and suck-up elected officials who are afraid to speak out for common decency, its a real turn-off to tourists. Such is the situation on the entire West Coast, but it is especially true in Portland. KPTV8 reports that the people in charge of the tourism department feel that murdered people, ever-expanding homeless encampments, and riots are costing the city tourist dollars. Heres the problem, said Commissioner Mingus Mapps. Around the world, too many people associate Portland with homelessness and homicide. Today, a significant chunk of humanity is afraid of spending time and money in our city. Perplexing, really. But the following may provide some clues. News surfaced this week that a city councilman from the West Coast Washington city of Olympia, Clark Gilman, who is that fair citys Mayor Pro-tem, wrote a love letter to Antifa during his campaign for office, and its a beaut. ...

Companies will see a 10 increase on their tax rate if the CEO makes 100 times the average employee and a 25 increase if they make 250 times the average salary, The Guardian reports1. The stated goal of the policy is to help decrease the homeless population in Portland, which accounts for roughly 1,800 people sleeping on the street each night.

portland,"Portland, Oregon is raising taxes on companies with CEOs making 100 times employee salaries — and giving the money to the homeless",2016-12-09T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,KGW,"The new law, which passed 3-1 in the city council, is expected to generate between 2.5 million and 3.5 million a year starting in January 2018. Though no specific plans have been announced, every dollar will go toward programs that help rehabilitate the homeless. According to the research on executive pay versus median employee pay, there will be ample chances for Portland to get those funds. In 2014, a study3 conducted by the Economic Policy Institute found executives made about 20 times the average worker in 1965. By 2013, they were making about 300 times the average worker. Steve Novick, the city commissioner who proposed the measure, told the Guardian that 540 publicly traded companies would hit the threshold for the tax. Novick says he drew inspiration for the policy from French economist Thomas Piketty. In speaking to the New York Times, however, Piketty says the terms of the policy were still too lenient. This is certainly part of the solution, Piketty told the Times4 via email, but the tax surcharge needs to be large enough the threshold 100 times should be substantially lowered. Portland officials hope other cities with taxes on business income, such as Columbus, Ohio and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, implement similar policies. California tried its hand at the idea in 2014, with a plan that reduced taxes for CEOs making less than 100 times the average worker, but the bill never passed.

As reported by the Associated Press4, the city will pilot the project this summer with four homeless families in Multnomah County, Oregon. Approximately 200 homeowners have expressed interest in putting pods in their backyards. Those who live in the pods will pay a limited amount of rent, and will receive social services that the county provides to homeless families it houses. Becca and Kelly Love, Portland residents who are considering putting a pod in their backyard, told5 the AP they understand the effects of rising rents in the city. Just because you dont have housing, it doesnt make you a bad person or more likely to be a bad tenant. In fact, youd be a better tenant because youd appreciate it, Becca Love said to the AP.

The problem is apparent along theSpringwater Corridor, a popular biking trail on the east side of Portland thatis cherished as peaceful slice of nature hidden from the urban sprawl.",homeless
portland,Why Portland's Homeless Problem Is the Worst in the Nation,2019-10-18T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,KGW,"In 2016, a shantytown alongside a two-mile stretch of the corridor was the largest homeless encampment in the nation2. It contained nearly 200 tents and an estimated 500 homeless people. In the years since, criminal activity has become a routine occurrence. For example, in August 2018, police arrested a homeless woman for attempting to kidnap a 6-year-old girl playing near the trail. Two months later, a shooting occurred. This year, an assailant stabbed a man in the arm before fleeing back into the sea of tents. Unfortunately, the Springwater Corridor is no exception in Portland it is a microcosm of Oregons largest city. In 2018, Portland was home to an estimated 14,000 chronically homeless people, the vast majority of whom were in Portland, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development3. The Portland Police Department has noofficial policy on clearing out the camps or relocating homeless individuals.Third parties now shoulder the burden of coordinating with the city andobtaining police protection in cleaning up the camps. Local officials claim to be pursuingsolutions, but the solutions offered thus far affordable-housingbonds4 and refusing to enforce prohibitions on camping on public rights of way and in city parks donothing to address the lack of mental-health treatment and drug-abuse problemsat the root of this humanitarian crisis. Nor is this a recent phenomenon. The neglectspans decades. Oregon first opened the doors of DammaschState Hospital in 1961 with the aim of treating those afflicted with mentalillness. The facility was meant to relieve overcrowding at the larger statehospital in Salem. More and more individuals flooded into theasylum, and by the 1980s, the newer hospital had also exceeded capacity. Theovercrowding, combined with widespread abuse toward patients, worsened. Rather than reform the mental-healthtreatment system, the state simply closed Dammasch in 1995, releasing thepatients ill-equipped to function independently onto the streets of Portland. Nearly25 years later, the homeless, many of whom are addicted to drugs, remain on thestreets in the same abhorrent conditions.In 2016 alone, Portland police seized about284 pounds of heroin and meth5. But those who are afflictedby addiction often never have to confront their habit, at least not due tolegal consequences. Oregons drug policy is defined by leniency.Police have neither the resources, nor the backing of their superiors to arrest6an individual for being on drugs in public or for having drugs on their person.In practice, heroin and meth are legal. That isnt humane. Its gross governmental dereliction of duty. Resolving the homelessness crisis requires us to acknowledge the humanity of those afflicted. They are not human refuse they are people, albeit badly broken. But fixing the problem requires more than just a token verbal acknowledgment. Part of recognizing their humanity is understanding that the homeless are not merely victims of circumstance. They need help taking the first steps toward reclaiming their lives. The situation has gotten so bad that it nowdemands aggressive action at both the city and state levels. The police must beempowered to disperse these camps. Courts should require those in violation ofdrug laws to seek treatment. Community detox centers in Portland shouldbecome core to the solution. These centers already offer the homeless trainingin job and social skills. These locally based organizations directly target drugand mental illness issues, but they are underutilized because the city has turneda blind eye to illicit-drug use and continues to tolerate street camping. Another key part of the solution is to give renewed focus to mental health treatment. Sometimes, that may require at least a temporary respite from independent living. Both the general population and the homeless are put at risk by the current situation. To better serve these individuals, we must remove the stigma surrounding mental-health treatment and replace it with understanding. That may be the only hope for these individuals to regain safe, productive lives. The post Why Portlands Homeless Problem Is the Worst in the Nation7 appeared first on The Daily Signal8.

portland,Federal Police Reform Talks Have Failed - But Local Efforts Stand a Better Chance of Success,2021-09-25T00:00:00Z,Naked Capitalism,KGW,"Nevertheless, advocates of police reform have been working to implement lasting reforms, with not much success. This article takes stock and suggests a way forward. By Thaddeus L. Johnson, Assistant Professor of Criminal Justice and Criminology, Georgia State University and Natasha N. Johnson, Clinical Instructor of Criminal Justice and Criminology, Georgia State University. Originally published at The Conversation1 Bipartisan talks over police reform ended with no agreement2 on Sept. 22, 2021, with House Democrats and Republicans blaming each other for the lack of progress. It isnt the first time that reform at a federal level3 has been attempted - nor the first time it has stalled4. The sticking points5 this time appear to be centered around proposed changes to use-of-force procedures and plans to strip officers of qualified immunity6, which shields them from being sued. As scholars of criminal justice7 - one a former police officer of 10 years8 - we were not surprised by the collapse of bipartisan talks. Policing in the U.S. is politicized, making it harder to reach consensus in an age of polarization, even though most Americans believe that major changes9 are needed. In determining the magnitude of this failure, it is important to keep in mind that policing in the U.S. is inherently local. The nearly 18,000 police departments10 in the country face a variety of different issues, ranging from problems recruiting enough officers - and of a sufficient caliber - to a breakdown of trust with the community. Even without legislation from Congress, there is a national blueprint11 for police reform. President Barack Obamas Task Force on 21st Century Policing12 set out six pillars to guide departments toward better practices. Those included strategies to build trust with the community, provide oversight, implement better training and procedures, and improve officer safety and well-being. The federal government can play a clear role in regard to financing reform and addressing nonpolicing issues that contribute to crime, such as underlying poverty and the lack of green spaces. In the years after the 911 attacks, the federal government made funding available13 for local departments to buy military-grade weapons and vehicles through the Defense Logistics Agencys 1033 Program and the Homeland Security Grant Program. The federal government might now be better placed playing a similar role as a funder for local law enforcement reforms. City by City While reform has stalled in Congress, there has been movement14elsewhere. Steps toward reform are underway in many U.S. cities, including Philadelphia15 Oakland, California16 and Portland, Oregon17. Many of these efforts18 are geared toward ending specific practices, including those that tripped up negotiations in Congress, such as the granting of qualified immunity19 and the use of no-knock warrants20. Mayors and city councils nationwide have also pushed reforms emphasizing accountability and transparency21, with many working to create independent oversight commissions22. From Ferguson, Missouri, to Baltimore, Oakland and Chicago, numerous city police departments have undergone transformation efforts following controversial police killings. Not all of the reform movements have lived up to their promises. After the shooting death of unarmed teen Michael Brown23 in 2014, police in Ferguson agreed to a reform program24 that included anti-bias training and an agreement to end stop, search and arrest practices that discriminate on the basis of race. But five years into the process, a report by the nonprofit Forward Through Ferguson25 found the reforms had done little to change policing culture or practice26. This was backed up by a Ferguson Civilian Review Board report in July 202027 that found the disparity in traffic stops between Black and white residents appears to be growing. Similarly, concerns over the quality of Baltimores police services persist28 despite federal oversight and reforms brought on after the death of Freddie Gray29 in police custody in 2015. Commentators have pointed to a resistance to change30 among officers and an inability to garner community buy-in31 as reasons for the slowdown in progress in Baltimore. Part of the problem, as seen with Baltimore, is that federal intervention does not appear to guarantee lasting change32. Research shows33 that Department of Justice regulations aimed at reform only slightly reduce police misconduct. There is also no evidence that national efforts targeting the use of force alone mitigate police killings34. Community-Led Reform One beacon of hope is the Cincinnati Police Department. Twenty years ago, residents in Cincinnati experienced events similar to what many cities have faced in more recent years. An unarmed Black man, Timothy Thomas35, was shot dead by officers in 2001, sparking widespread unrest. It led Cincinnati to enter into a different model of reform a collaborative agreement36. Touted by former U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch as a national model for community-led police reform37, the collaborative agreement saw the police department, civic government, police unions and local civil rights groups act in partnership for a reform program backed by court supervision. The resulting changes to use-of-force policies, a focus on community-based solutions to crime and robust oversight brought about improved policing. A 2009 Rand evaluation38 of the collaborative agreement found that it resulted in a reduction in crime, positive changes in citizens attitudes toward police and fewer racially biased traffic stops. There were also fewer use-of-force incidents and officer and arrestee injuries39. But it isnt perfect. Cincinnatis Black residents continue to be disproportionately arrested - likely owing to the concentration of crime, service calls and police deployments in predominantly Black neighborhoods. Figures from 2018 show Black Cincinnati residents were roughly three times40 as likely to be arrested as their white counterparts. Cincinnatis collaborative agreement contained a number of elements that experts say are needed if police reforms are to be successful strong leadership flexible, goal-oriented approaches effective oversight and externally regulated transparency. Moreover, it depended on police officials ability to cultivate community investment41 and overcome resistance from police officers and police unions. Community confidence is critical to police reform and community safety42. When citizens view police as legitimate and trustworthy, they are more likely to report crimes, cooperate during police investigations, comply with directives and work with police to find solutions to crime. Beyond Collaboration Efforts like those in Cincinnati that put community engagement at the heart of police reforms undoubtedly are strides in the right direction. But they can go only so far. A noticeable shortcoming in most police reform programs is a focus on what is the right thing to do during confrontations with the public, rather than on trying to avert those situations in the first place. Fatal police shootings43 often happen during police stops and arrests - situations that carry increased risks44 of citizen resistance and violent police response. Scaling back low-level enforcement, such as arrests for vagrancy and loitering - much of which has little public safety advantage45- and having police partner with civilian responders for mental health, homelessness and drug-related calls, could mean fewer opportunities for violent police encounters46. Some departments have begun to change their enforcement policies along these lines. The Gwinnett County Police Department in Georgia, for example, stopped making arrests and issuing citations for misdemeanor marijuana possession47. A 2018 study48 of traffic stops in Fayetteville, North Carolina, found that redirecting enforcement away from minor infractions - such as broken taillights and expired tags - and toward the more serious violations of speeding and running traffic lights resulted in reduced crime and a narrowed racial gap in stops and searches. Isolated successes suggest that a localized approach emphasizing community buy-in may be key to police reform. That is not to say that the federal government cant play a role - just that it may be better off looking at ways to help facilitate change at a departmental or citywide level. 38utm_mediumfeedamp38utm_campaignFeednakedcapitalism28nakedcapitalism29This entry was posted in Guest Post49, Income disparity50, Politics51, Social policy52 on September 25, 202153 by Yves Smith54.  1  2  3 38contextflr  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40 stateOhioamp38agencyCincinnati20Police20Departmentamp38categoryall_arrests_totalamp38subcategorytotamp38subsubcategoryRaceamp38ratetrueamp38percentfalseamp38monthlyfalseamp38checkbox_1falseamp38checkbox_2falseamp38checkbox_3falseamp38checkbox_4falseamp38checkbox_1true  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54",homelessness
portland,American Cities Have Long Struggled to Reform Their Police - but Isolated Success Stories Suggest Community and Officer Buy-In Might Be Key,2021-05-01T00:00:00Z,Naked Capitalism,KGW,"The question becomes, Are Black Lives Matter protests having any real effect in terms of generating change? The data show very clearly that where you had Black Lives Matter protests, killing of people by the police decreased. Its inescapable from this study that protest mattersthat it can generate change. However, this change is still from a bad baseline. And the question of what sort of reforms might work is still a very much debated question. You might also be interested in an earlier piece on this topic Five Days Without Cops Could Brooklyn Policing Experiment be a Model for the Future?2 From our overview THE CITY has mentioned trained violence interruptors before in its articles here, they appear as a key element in a police reform experiment. Notice that the intent was to remove cops as the primary means for monitoring and enforcing neighborhood safety people who were closer to the community served as the main eyes and ears, with the police at a remove but ready to step in. Although five days in one district is too limited a trial to declare victory, this test went well and strongly suggests that this approach merits more implementations and refinements. As youll see from the article, some of the elements for success were situation-specific. The Brownsville area had a tense relationship with the police. NYPD moved one cop whod roughed up some locals off the street and also replaced the precinct head with a an officer from the neighborhood. That commanding officer, Terrell Anderson, set out to rebuild relations with the community. By Thaddeus L. Johnson, Assistant Professor of Criminal Justice and Criminology, Georgia State University and Natasha N. Johnson, Clinical Instructor of Criminal Justice and Criminology, Georgia State University. Originally published at The Conversation3 The guilty verdicts delivered against Derek Chauvin4 on April 20, 2021, represented a landmark moment - but courtroom justice cannot deliver the sweeping changes most Americans feel are needed5 to improve policing in the U.S. As America continues to grapple with racism and police killings, federal action over police reform has stalled6 in Congress. But at the state level there is movement7 and steps toward reform are underway in many U.S. cities, including Philadelphia8 Oakland, California9 and Portland, Oregon10. Many of these efforts11 are geared toward ending specific practices, such as the granting of qualified immunity12, through which officers are shielded from civil lawsuits, and the use of certain police neck holds13 and no-knock warrants14. Mayors and city councils nationwide have also pushed reforms emphasizing accountability and transparency15, with many working to create independent oversight commissions16. Its too soon to expect substantial improvement from these recently proposed remedies. But as scholars of criminal justice17 - one a former police officer of 10 years18 - we know America has been here before. From Ferguson to Baltimore and Oakland to Chicago, numerous city police departments have undergone transformation efforts following controversial police killings. But these and other reform movements havent lived up to their promises.

Removing the Trigger Low-level infractions have often been the triggers for police interventions that end in citizen deaths45. Eric Garner - who died in 2014 after a New York police officer put him in a banned chokehold46 - was stopped for selling loose cigarettes47. Devoting less time to policing such activity would also free up officers time to devote to such endeavors as analyzing crime trends, conducting wellness checks on elderly residents and mentoring community youth. I Thaddeus Johnson felt this as a police officer on the street, and I see it as a criminal justice scholar now. The examples of Cincinnati, Ferguson and Baltimore show that getting community buy-in is crucial if attempts to improve policing are to be successful. We believe that evaluating officers performance and rewarding them based on community-oriented activities - rather than just the number of stops and arrests - could foster the support necessary for lasting reform.38utm_mediumfeedamp38utm_campaignFeedNakedCapitalism28nakedcapitalism29 This entry was posted in Banana republic48, Guest Post49, Income disparity50, Politics51, Social policy52 on May 1, 202153 by Yves Smith54.  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36 stateOhioamp38agencyCincinnati20Police20Departmentamp38categoryall_arrests_totalamp38subcategorytotamp38subsubcategoryRaceamp38ratetrueamp38percentfalseamp38monthlyfalseamp38checkbox_1falseamp38checkbox_2falseamp38checkbox_3falseamp38checkbox_4falseamp38checkbox_1true  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54",homelessness

portland,Portland Resumes Homeless Camp Removal As Needles And Trash Pile Up,2021-05-20T00:00:00Z,Conservative Daily News,KOIN,"The size and number of homeless camps in the city increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, according1 to KOIN 6. Officials did not remove any camps from March to July 2020, then picked up operations in a limited capacity, targeting areas where the biggest health and safety risks2 were identified in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local guidelines. Officials removed around 50 campsites a week before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, KOIN 6 reported. With reduced operations over the last year, officials have removed an average of five sites a week. Campsites are targeted if they are causing an excess of trash including needles and other biohazardous waste like untreated sewage scattered across Portland. Despite campsites growing, officials arent sure if more people are homeless than at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to KOIN 6. Officials say it could take more than two years to clean up the encampments and trash to a pre-pandemic level. Around 30 campsite locations have more than 10 structures, up from four or five spots a year ago, KOIN 6 reported. The number of campsites that score higher than 70 on the citys Impact Reduction Programs 100-point risk assessment scale has up by 20 locations. Officials with the Impact Reduction Program reported record-breaking numbers of trash collection from campsites during the pandemic, according to KOIN 6. Over 818,500 pounds of trash was removed from campsites in March 2021, compared with 650,000 pounds during the same time in 2020. We recognize the challenging work done by the Impact Reduction Program to respect individuals experiencing houselessness while also maintaining safe and hygienic conditions, and are extremely grateful for the thoughtfulness and compassion they bring to their work, Democratic Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler said in a joint statement with Portland Commissioners, KOIN 6 reported. Officials are looking into city-owned properties to serve as shelter facilities3 or camp sites for those displaced by the cleanup, according to KOIN 6.

As the following case illustrates, it also garnered the attention of a dozen cops who collected their taxpayer funded salaries to guard the dumpster and make sure the food never made its way to this homeless population. According to reports, the Fred Meyer story on Hollywood in Portland lost power on Tuesday and threw away thousands of food items they say were no longer safe for consumption due to the temperatures the items had reached. The decision was made out of an abundance of caution, according to a Fred Meyer spokesperson. To be clear, the food was not expired and was actually preserved outside due to the cold temperatures and many people were more than willing to take it regardless of the warning from Fred Meyer. When someone spotted the food, they posted it on social media and individuals, hungry and helpful alike, descended on the Fred Meyer dumpster.go snag some free food if you can get to the Hollywood Fred Meyer in Portland yall pic.twitter.comFv86mvNWrB3 The Important Project mr1mportant February 16, 20214On Tuesday afternoon, the group of people around the dumpster collecting the food were quickly met by police officers. According to police, an employee called because they felt the situation was escalating and feared there may be a physical confrontation. A Fred Meyer spokesperson sent the following statement5 in regard to the incident We appreciate people speaking out against hunger. We get it, throwing away food is never a good thing. Unfortunately, some perishable food that requires refrigeration at our Hollywood store was out of temperature for a protracted period of time. This was due to a weather-related power outage and it is not safe for consumption. Out of an abundance of caution, we are disposing of the product to keep people safe. We engaged law enforcement, as the safety of our associates and customers is always our top priority. .comgold-guideActivist-Post-Recommended-Gold-IRA-Dealer-Cerified-Gold-Exchange.htmlBut these folks were hungry and were willing to get food from a dumpster. They know the risks, why not let them have it? People dumpster dive for expired food all the time and no one stops them. This time, however, police stepped in to stop it. After that, other people started showing up and asking them, Why are you guys guarding a dumpster? local resident Morgan Mckniff said to Oregon Live.6 People took to Twitter to criticize the response by police, noting that they often take a very long time to respond to calls if they show up at all, but when it was people trying to feed themselves, they showed up in full force.The times weve called 911 in PDX before, nobody has come. Maybe next time Ill tell them my garbage is being raided. Woode Woode2380 February 17, 20218 Mckniff said many of the people police threatened with arrest and turned away are regular customers of the store, according to Oregon Live. I live in this neighborhood. This neighborhood doesnt have power, Mckniff said. And Fred Meyer is telling people in this immediate community who shop here that they cant have these things theyre throwing away. Cheese, pickles, yogurt things that are intentionally cultured and cured. One person in attendance drew a parallel between the police response to the dumpster and police response to protests over the summer. Here its not broken windows, its tossed away but otherwise completely fine food, that person said. Its not a bad situation or vandalism, its literally the exact opposite feeding hungry people. Yet they still use the same apparatus to prevent anything from being done. Luckily, the police eventually left after realizing that there was no legitimate threat to person or property. The people returned and were able to get the food without incident, illustrating the unnecessary show of force in the first place.

By the numbers In a survey this fall, around 13 of all adults in the country 27 million said their households didnt have enough food during the last week, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities1. Thats nearly four times the number of adults who said they didnt have enough to eat at some point in all of 2019.Latinas and Black women are especially vulnerable. Another survey found that one in six Latinas and one in five Black, non-Hispanic women said they didnt have enough to eat during the last week, per the National Womens Law Center2. The U.S. poverty rate jumped 2.4 percentage points to 11.73, throwing nearly 8 million people into poverty, researchers found in a study last week4. Thats the biggest one-year increase in the 60 years that the government has been tracking poverty, according to the Washington Post5. Renters are in trouble. By next year, roughly 12 million will owe an average of 5,850 in back rent and utilities, per WaPo6.Between 2.4 million and 5 million U.S. households are at risk of eviction in January alone, per the investment bank and financial-advisory firm Stout Risius Ross7.And at a time when so many Americans are turning to food banks for help, many are short of holiday volunteers because of safety concerns, Reuters8 reports. The good news is, Americans rich and not-so-much have stepped up to make the holidays a little less bleak for those in need. Mackenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, announced9 on Dec. 15 that she had donated 4 billion over the past four months to 384 nonprofit organizations focused on basic needs.Bezos himself donated10 100 million to Feeding America, a Chicago-based nonprofit with more than 200 food banks across the U.S.Oprah Winfrey in April donated11 10 million to coronavirus relief efforts, with 1 million going to Americas Food Fund to help alleviate food insecurity.The Bill and Melissa Gates Foundation donated 1.75 billion to the global virus response12.And Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey donated13 28 of his wealth 1 billion to global pandemic relief, putting the money into Start Small14, which funds a variety of programs. Large sums of money are not the only way to help needy communities People across the country started setting up GoFundMe accounts for specific needs, such as these fundraisers for the families of infected Arlington firefighters15 and for living supplies for the less fortunate in San Diego, California16. Check out the GoFundMe17 site to search for others.Food businesses are also helping families put food on the table for the holidays. Staten Island residents are buying holiday dinners for needy families through the Staten Island 4 Staten Island18 effort, and restaurants in Lincoln City, Oregon are offering Merry Meals19 to donate toys and food to their community. What you can do If youre able, give to those who really need your help. Scotts list20 of the 384 charities she donated to is a great place to start. Restaurant Workers Community Foundation21, which has set up an emergency relief fund for restaurant workers, and Children of Restaurant Employees22 are among the groups accepting cash donations to help small businesses. Other nonprofits are also accepting non-financial donations, such as Toys for Tots23, which collects toys and distributes them to children in need, and The Conscious Kid24, which accepts anti-racist childrens books and now has a rent relief fund that has raised over 500,000 since April.Helping Hands25 serves seniors and those who are immunocompromised or have preexisting conditions with grocery and other essential supply deliveries, all done contact-free.  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21 38campaign2amp38testtrue  22  23 38utm_mediumWebsite_DonateAToyamp38utm_campaignToysforTots_from_TFT  24  25",homelessness

So many people that I hear from cant understand why I am so negative about the future, because they are completely convinced that really great days are just around the corner. As odd as this may sound, we are seeing this sort of wild optimism among both Democrats and Republicans, Christians and atheists, capitalists and communists. Of course about half the country will have their optimistic hopes for the future brutally crushed by the results of the upcoming election, but we arent there yet. For now, both sides are absolutely convinced that they are going to win, and both sides are envisioning a wonderful new era for our nation in which their values reign triumphant. If only things were that easy. The truth is that many of our largest problems have been steadily growing for decades, and they arent going to magically disappear just because a particular candidate wins an election. Our debt levels are absolutely exploding, our economy has plunged into a depression, there is widespread civil unrest in our streets, our nation is more divided than it has ever been in my entire lifetime, and our society is literally coming apart at the seams as just about every form of evil that you can possibly imagine is growing rapidly all around us. But there are a whole lot of people out there that want to stick their heads in the sand and pretend that everything is going to be just fine. If you would like to be just like them, the following are 20 things that you must believe in order to convince yourself that everything is going to turn out okay somehow96 21 Scholars Call for Pulitzer Board to Revoke 1619 Project Authors Prize97 Twenty-one distinguished scholars in higher education and research published a letter calling for New York Times editor Nikole Hannah-Jones to lose her 2020 prize for her controversial 1619 Project series that many have deemed revisionist history. In the letter, the scholars assert that the Pulitzer board awarded Hannah-Jones the prize in Literature with a celebration of its alternative view of history, which asserts that Americas true founding was in 1619 with the arrival of African slaves at Jamestown, rather than 1776.98 Airports Begin Testing COVID Passport That Will Record Whether Someone Has Been Vaccinated Before Travel99 Passengers on United Airlines and Cathay Pacific traveling out of Heathrow Airport will begin testing a new COVID passport that in the future will check if someone has been vaccinated before they travel.

And who do you suppose they put on the front cover on the latest issue of Times 100 most influential? None other than the despised Anthony Fauci. You cannot make this up Leviticus 1822 Exodus 2218 1 Kings 1333 Amos 57 Luke 2248. How can anyone with even the smallest sense of morality not see what is taking place here? They are clearly advocating what God clearly condemns. Yet, this is nothing new Deuteronomy 251.

Gates said that the end of 2021 is a best case scenario and that it remains unknown whether a successful vaccine will even be produced. We still dont know whether these vaccines will succeed, said the Microsoft founder. Now the capacity will take time to ramp up. And so the allocation within the US, and between the US and other countries will be a very top point of contention.108 Black Appraisals of Black Lives Matter  Part III109 This multi-part series Part I here, Part II here focuses on the perspectives of blacks  conservative, liberal or libertarian  who appraise BLM and its agenda.

Its 449-page report criticizes these companies for buying competitors, preferencing their own services, and holding outsized power over smaller businesses that use their platforms. Our investigation revealed an alarming pattern of business practices that degrade competition and stifle innovation, said committee member Val Demings D-FL. Competition must reward the best idea, not the biggest corporate account. We will take steps necessary to hold rulebreakers accountable. The majoritys report lays out a number of concrete policy recommendations, which, taken together, would drastically change how the tech industry operates. It urges Congress to consider passing commercial nondiscrimination rules that would make large companies offer equal terms to companies selling products and services on their platforms. It recommends barring certain dominant platforms from competing in adjacent lines of business where theyd have a huge advantage. To put it simply, companies that once were scrappy, underdog startups that challenged the status quo have become the kinds of monopolies we last saw in the era of oil barons and railroad tycoons, the report says. By controlling access to markets, these giants can pick winners and losers throughout our economy. They not only wield tremendous power, but they also abuse it by charging exorbitant fees, imposing oppressive contract terms, and extracting valuable data from the people and businesses that rely on them.122 Correctional Officer Allegedly Pulls Knife on Trump Supporters123 PORTLAND, Ore.

Andrew Cuomo is calling for Mayor Bill de Blasio to get it under control, but city officials say liberal pushes to defund the police have hindered the NYPDs ability to keep the city safe. Defunding the police is perhaps the worst idea in NYC government history, Democrat Councilman Robert Holden told Fox News. We cant legislate using fashionable slogans that fit on protest signs. It hurts every New Yorker. The NYPD are the gold standard for law enforcement around the world. Any issues that need to be addressed require more training, which costs money. The city, however, disagrees, with de Blasio backing a city council vote in July to slash the police budget by 1 billion. Crime has only worsened in recent months and police response times have grown.128 Derek Chauvin, Cop Charged in George Floyds Death, Released on 1 Million Bond129 Derek Chauvin, the Minneapolis ex-cop charged in the death of George Floyd, was released from prison Wednesday on a 1 million bond.

Another common find is lithium, a vital component of electric car batteries. This is one step towards understanding how Earth concentrates lithium in certain places and minerals, said Rice graduate student Patrick Phelps, co-author of a study published online in Nature Communications. If we can understand the basics of pegmatite growth rates, its one step in the direction of understanding the whole picture of how and where they form.134 Elementary School Kids Taught That Objectivity And Perfectionism Are Racist Traits of White Supremacy135 Children at an elementary school in Virginia are being taught that traits such as objectivity and perfectionism are racist characteristics of white supremacy.

These are mostly symptoms of the common cold or flu. So why was he subjected to experimental drugs and procedures? And why was hydroxychloroquine taken off the table? For the record, the CDC says symptoms of a cold usually peak within 2 to 3 days and can include sneezing, stuffy nose, runny nose, sore throat, coughing, mucus dripping down your throat post-nasal drip, watery eyes, and fever although most people with colds do not have fever. The flu can include some of these factors plus fatigue. Based on his own experience with the disease, Trump issued a statement comparing coronavirus to the flu. That was significant. But Big Tech companies Twitter and Facebook immediately censored him. As if we needed more evidence, it should be clear by now that Big Tech and certain political forces are determined to convince the public that COVID-19 is not a flu-like illness. Taking guidance from the World Health Organization, a Chinese puppet, they want people to be scared. By contrast, Trump wanted to reassure people that they can fight and beat the disease, like he did.178 Trump Campaign Reserves Seat at VP Debate for Tupac After Kamala Harris Called Him Her Favorite Rapper Alive179 The Trump campaign has left a ticket for dead rapper Tupac Shakur at Wednesday nights Vice Presidential debate, in reference to Democrat vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris bizarre statement that Tupac is her favorite rapper alive.180 Video Biden Makes Racist Gaffe About Black Women Stocking Grocery Shelves181 Democratic candidate Joe Biden put his foot in his mouth once again recently, this time making a comment that had it come from President Trumps mouth would have sent leftists into a frothing meltdown, given that it was straight up racist.

Why arent good Americans at school board meetings demanding objective teaching in our schools? Why arent parents pouring through textbooks to see what public education is teaching their children and demanding the textbooks be re-written to fit reality and truth. If the parents started reading textbooks they will be shocked and demand change. What price a childs mind? They have taken over our colleges where free thought, new ideas and thoughtful debate are supposed to be the hallmarks of a good education. But instead, college deans, boards, professors and staff limit all ideas and all curriculums to only Progressive socialist ideas while censoring any other ideas, sometimes with violence. Meanwhile, good Americans that send their kids to these dens of socialism seem oblivious to the mindset shift to Progressivism that has been taking place before their very eyes, for several generations. How can public education be any better than the teachers being taught at our liberal colleges? In fact, where did Common Core State Standards come from but from the graduates of our one-sided liberal colleges? Who writes the textbooks for public education but those educated idiots that come out of Americas liberal academia? If only God would spare Americans the utterances and expert advice of over-educated aristocrats of higher education that throw common sense and logic to the far winds. Theyre allowing hordes of illegal aliens to swarm our country, take our jobs and burn up billions of our social service dollars with no consequences and good Americans watch and do nothing. It turns out that the law only applies to the good people of America. Criminals, corrupt politicians, bureaucrats and illegal aliens are exempt from the law. Why arent Hillary Clinton and James Comey in jail? Why do good Americans stand for this injustice?184 Facebook Bans Alternative Media Outlet Radio-Qubec185 Facebook has started deleting pages and groups on the platform that were supporting QAnon.

Regrettably, some member states and the European Parliament try to reopen the July conclusions of the European Council and jeopardize the adoption of the legislative package, Varga wrote. Those who never really supported the economic recovery of Europe are now using rule of law conditionality, completely absent from the European Council conclusions, as a pretext to dismantle the agreement.192 German Power Prices Soar Taxes, Green Fees Make Up 54 of Cost193 Thanks to the Energiewende transition to green energies, which is tantamount to a vegan energy diet, Germanys electricity prices have soared 27 over the past decade to become the most expensive in Europe, if not the world, according to the STROM-REPORT.

Judge Peter Ross officially retired last week after a career presiding over some of the biggest cases at Oxford Crown Court. The 65-year-old well-known figure on the Oxford circuit said he would spend his retirement with his family out of the area. Speaking to the Oxford Mail before his final sitting day he said I had no intention to go on until 70. I have done some major cases over the last three years including the last three Oxford grooming trials. They were exhausting and also emotional because of what you are listening to. And intellectually because the areas are relatively new or novel law is involved, and from a case management perspective particularly they are simply huge. I decided I had had enough, because of their sheer size and because one listens not just to the accounts of what happened, awful though they are, but you also see the terrible consequences upon the lives of the young women who have been the victims. Their lives are destroyed and thats quite distressing to observe at close quarters208 UK Given Chance to Oppose Drastic Curbs on Freedom, Just 12 Tories Rebel209 Just 12 Conservative Members of Parliament rebelled against the Tory government and voted down the controversial rule of six coronavirus social distancing law. While the law is already in force and the motion voted on Tuesday night was purely retrospective, it gave the so-called band of Conservative rebels the opportunity to offer a protest against the governments rule of six, which limits socialising to no more than six people.

Trump tweeted on Wednesday evening, exactly 19 years to the day after the US invasion of the country in 2001.218 Global Perception of China Plunges in Democracies Worldwide, Survey Shows219 The reputation of China and its President Xi Jinping plummeted in democracies across the globe this year  specifically because of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new survey. After interviewing over 14,000 adults in 14 countries with advanced economies  including the US, Canada, Germany, France, Australia, Japan and South Korea  the Pew Research Center found that unfavorable views of the Communist nation and its leader had reached historic highs.

Over 765 Million People Worldwide Contract Coronavirus, More Than 20 Times the Estimated Number223 Breitbart  Over 765 million people, have contracted the Chinese coronavirus. Comment Garbage. These numbers are those who tested as positive using PCR test that is not designed for testing for China virus. All the test does is show you have a fragment of a type of corona virus including common colds in your body. So if you had a cold and recovered you would test positive for China virus. This is the scam. This is what is driving the supposed 2nd wave. The public is being lied to 224 More Melbourne Insanity Mom Arrested at Beach for Traveling Outside Her Permitted 5km Radius225 Aussies are growing sick and tired of essentially being locked indoors and confined to their local areas under tight regulations, even as cases drop and the weather grows better.226 This is Australia, Not a Muslim Country Middle Eastern Security Who Ordered Bikini-Clad Sunbaker to Cover Up at Her Apartment Complexs Private Pool Have Targeted More Women  Leaving Them Beyond Mortified227 Security guards at Emerald Park in Zetland have been telling women to cover up or leave the private pool area because their swimwear is deemed inappropriate for pool standards.228 Three Afghans Are Charged With Forcing Woman, 21, Into an Arranged Marriage Two Months Before Her Uber Driver Husband Stabbed Her to Death and Led Police to Her Body While Covered in Blood229 Uber driver Mohammad Ali Halimi, 25, was in January charged with murdering his 21-year-old wife in Perth after she was allegedly forced to marry him in regional Victoria in November 2019.230 Victoria Records 11 New Cases of Coronavirus Overnight and Zero Deaths  After Dan Andrews Was Forced to Back Down on Plans for Controversial Powers of Detention231 The new cases, confirmed by the Department of Health and Human Services on Thursday, brings Melbournes 14-day case average to 9.7, a slight drop from 9.9 on Wednesday.232 139 Migrant Minors Arrive in Germany, But Government Refuses to Provide Their Age and Gender233 Last week, 139 migrants from Greece arrived in Germany, but the Federal Ministry of the Interior refuses to release data about their ages, nationality and gender despite a press request for that information. The interior ministry did send press release with the title Another flight with sick children and unaccompanied minors from Greece landed in Hanover. In addition to the 51 unaccompanied minors, there were 17 sick children and their core families. What is less clear is the age, gender and nationality of those 51 unaccompanied migrant minors. With underage and unaccompanied asylum seekers costing around 5,000 per month just for accommodation and the German state planning to spend 64.5 billion on migrants over the next four years, some German taxpayers are curious about where their money is going, prompting the German news outlet Junge Freiheit to request the Federal Ministry of the Interior release gender, age, and nationality information.234 France NGO Claims Around Half of Migrants on Paris Streets May be Coronavirus Positive235 According to NGO Doctors without Borders Mdecins Sans FrontiresMSF, 55 per cent of those living on the streets of the Paris region might be infected with the Wuhan coronavirus, the vast majority of them migrants.

Around 65 migrants, mostly Tunisians, threw fire extinguishers, bed structures, broken glass and other objects at police and set light to mattresses. Six of the migrants, who were in COVID-19 quarantine at the reception centre, are thought to have managed to flee the facility, sources said. Valter Mazzetti, the secretary general of the State police union federation, said this was the umpteenth revolt of this kind. These episodes take place with alarming frequency but they are now taken as if they were normal and this is unacceptable, Mazzetti said. The current situation should force a complete revision of the surveillance systems at these centres, which are ticking bombs, above all on the health level due to the coronavirus emergency, but also in terms of public order.240 Italy Cabinet Approves New Security Decree, Rewriting Salvini Legislation241 Package overhauls controversial Salvini-drafted legislation ANSA  ROME, OCT 6  Premier Giuseppe Contes cabinet has approved a new package that overhauls former interior minister and League leader Matteo Salvinis controversial migrant-and-security decrees.

The package also introduces the possibility of people being banned from certain areas if they are involved in violence in night-life zones after the case of Willy Monteiro Duarte, a 21-year-old who was beaten to death at Colleferro, near Rome, last month. These lot spend their time dismantling things, rather than constructing them, Salvini said. From what Ive read, Id call it the illegal immigrants decree. We are going back to the free-for-all of illegal immigration, permits gifted to anyone walking down the streets and thousand-strong migrant landings.242 Jews in Malmo Are Fearful of Migrants and Fleeing the City, Says Swedish Writer at the UN243 Jewish institutions and Jews are being attacked and harassed in Sweden, according to Swedish writer Paulina Neuding.

Neuding believes the Swedish government is blind to the issue.244 Left-Wing Italian Government Relaxes Salvinis Tough Migration Rules Even as Immigration Surges245 The Italian government has approved the relaxation of migration rules implemented by former Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, which he originally introduced to reduce illegal immigration to Italy and remove incentives for human smugglers. The new measures, which will also extend the conditions for granting protection to refugees, were approved by the government late Monday evening, according to Czech news portal Echo24. They will come into force after approval by parliament.

The idea to use boats to house asylum seekers before they land on British shores formed part of leaked Home Office plans last week. Government sources earlier insisted that the ideas were only ever considered in brainstorming sessions, and complained that they are being leaked to damage ministers.254 UK Priti Patel Says Asylum System is Broken As 20 Cross-Channel Migrants Are Taken Off New Deportation Flight to Germany After Last-Minute Legal Challenges255 Priti Patel today branded Britains asylum system broken after 20 migrants were taken off a new deportation flight to Germany.

Yesterday, I wrote an article about how our society is breaking down everywhere we look, and nowhere is this more evident than in our marriages and in our families. But without strong marriages and strong families, no society can thrive for long. Recently, the Social Capital Project of the Joint Economic Committee Republicans released a report entitled The Demise of the Happy Two-Parent Home, but you probably never heard about it until now because it was almost entirely ignored by the mainstream media. I have never seen a congressional report document the collapse of marriage and family in American society to such an extent, and to be honest it is quite surprising to see such a quality piece of work come out of Washington.260 Anti-Lockdown Group the Mirror Project Banned From PayPal261 The lockdown-skeptic group The Mirror Project has recently lost its PayPal account after it was shut down by the company for allegedly spreading false narratives about COVID-19. YouTube did not take down the videos uploaded by the group and said that it hadnt violated any of its platform rules, but PayPal thought otherwise.

And while you might have an intuitive approximation of what these terms mean for America in the 21st century, theres a good chance that you dont know much about the deep theory, where the ideology comes from and what it has planned for America  and the world. The underlying theory here is a variant of Marxism, pioneered by early-20th-century Italian Marxist politician and linguist Antonio Gramsci. Gramscian Marxism is a radical departure from Classical Marxism. One does not need to endorse the Classical Marxism of Marx, Engels and others to appreciate the significant differences between the two. He is easily the most influential thinker that you have never heard of. Whereas Classical Marxism located what has been called the revolutionary subject the people who will overthrow capitalism and usher in socialism within the broad working class, primarily in what is now the First World, Gramscism takes a very different approach. This approach underpins most of the social unrest that is gripping America and the West today. In a sense, we are living through the endgame of a Gramscian revolution. There are two important diversions that Gramscism has from more traditional Marxist thought First, that economics was the base of culture and politics. Second, philosophical materialism in the Marxist sense where reality is effectively formed by the means of economic production. For Gramsci, culture was more important than either economics or politics. This was what needed to be changed for there to be a revolution. As such, the weapon to be used for revolution was not the economic might of an organized working class, but a long march through the institutions a phrase actually coined by German Marxist Rudi Dutschke, whereby every institution in the West would be subverted through penetration and infiltration. Throughout this article, we will use the term Cultural Marxism as a catchall to refer to this phenomenon, because it is the most all-encompassing and does not limit us to discussing any one specific variation Gramsci, the Frankfurt School or what have you. Finally, we should briefly mention that, the claims of Dr. Jordan Peterson notwithstanding, Cultural Marxism is ideologically distinct from postmodernism and deconstruction, both of which are hostile toward Marxism. We will not touch on either postmodernism or deconstruction in this article, though they certainly have been influential on the international left.266 Cuties Goes to Court Netflix Indicted by Texas Grand Jury for Lewd Depiction of Children in Controversial Film267 Netflixs streaming of Cuties led to a boycott campaign and calls by members of Congress for federal prosecutors to investigate the movie as child porn.268 Greta Thunberg, W.H.O.

U.S. President Donald Trumps chances have been dismissed by at least one observer because, he hasnt done anything that is deserving of the prize.270 Over 6000 Scientists, Doctors Sign Anti-Lockdown Petition271 Over six thousand scientists and doctors have signed a petition against coronavirus lockdown measures, urging that those not in the at risk category should be able to get on with their lives as normal, and that lockdown rules in both the US and UK are causing irreparable damage. Those who have signed include professors from the worlds leading universities. Oxford University professor Dr Sunetra Gupta was one of the authors of the open letter that was sent with the petition, along with Harvard Universitys Dr Martin Kulldorff and Stanfords Dr Jay Bhattacharya. It declares that social distancing and mask mandates are causing damaging physical and mental health impacts.272 YouTube and Vimeo Censor Pro-Life Video, Alleging to Show Hospital Refusing Care273 Created Equal, a non-profit organization had uploaded a video on YouTube and Vimeo where newly born twins were allegedly denied treatment in a hospital, resulting in their death. Both of the video-sharing platforms ended up taking the video down, with Vimeo even suspending Created Equals account. YouTube said that the video had violated its community standards, whereas Vimeo stated that it had violated its guidelines. Oddly, Vimeos given reason for the ban was, You cannot upload videos that are hateful, defamatory, or discriminatory.274 Growing Metallic Crystals in Liquid Metal275 Imagine an alien world with oceans of liquid metal If such a world exists, metallic elements are likely the sources of the dissolved materials and particles in these oceans.

Dan Sullivan has won reelection, defeating Democrat Al Gross in widely-watched race that had significant implications on control of the U.S. Senate.69 America is Worse Than Communist Venezuela70 Now we have learned that Diane Feinsteins husband Richard Blum is connected to the computer glitches switching Trump votes to Biden. A report from a neutral source confirms the suspicious nature of this arrangement. We are no better than communist Venezuela. In fact, we are in worse shape, since America is supposed to be the leader of the Free World, an example to other countries. Venezuela has one set of electronic voting machines, and we have another. Thats the difference. Plus, the mail-in voting schemes that President Trump warned about were utilized as well. That makes Americas elections even more suspicious. In America we have an Orwellian Ministry of Truth which serves the Deep State. For example, if you go to this video about the election process, from the point of view of an attorney sympathetic to Trump, you will find this claim inserted by Facebook, Election officials follow strict rules when it comes to ballot counting, handling and reporting. The source is the Bipartisan Policy Center. Sounds impressive. Of course, the claim is false, since there are multiple reports of fraudulent vote counting.71 Americas Divorce Rate Hits 50-Year Low, Likely to Continue Drop During Pandemic72 The U.S. divorce rate hit a 50-year low in 2019, according to recent census data.

This analysis proves that President Trump was spot on where the use of mail-in ballots in elections was concerned. The analysis, provided by Richard Baris, the director of the Big Data Poll company, reveals that more than 10,000 people both confirmed or suspected dead returned mail-in ballots to vote in Michigan this past election.75 Asking for People to be Peaceful is White Supremacy, BLM Protestor Shouts During Protest in Portland76 A group of protesters marched on Portlands streets on election night, reportedly shining lights into peoples apartments and asking them to come out into the streets. One of the BLM supporters even shouted at a White resident that asking for people to be peaceful is white supremacy. As the KATU news portal reported, the rally was hosted by the All Power To The People group.

The right-wing opposition says it is outrageous that the government does nothing about the critical conditions that have developed on the islands, conservative Hungarian daily Magyar Hirlap reports. The occupation of the southern islands of Italy continues even though Sicily has already become an amber zone in terms of the severity of the coronavirus epidemic.

It wants to achieve this by introducing the official identification X to serve people who do not identify with being a man or a woman.

Van Quickenborne announced this through a program statement. Last year, the local Constitutional Court stated that there should be far more benevolent laws for transgender people than before. The Constitutional Court announced that the current law, which has allowed people to change their gender since 2017, unreasonably continues to list only men and women, which is discriminatory according to the courts decision the law must therefore take into account individuals right to self-determination.189 Oxford Dictionary and Google Redefine the Word Bigot To Give it a Looser Meaning190 The way things are going, we may soon need a new term for Orwellian dystopia when it comes to various manner of language distortion and manipulation we have seen of late.

Im on the side of scholars who declare that it is not a science, Czarnek declared in an interview for Polskie Radio 24.193 YouTube Went Down Around the World, But its Now Fixed194 YouTube has recovered from a seemingly worldwide outage that prevented videos from loading for roughly an hour.

Running for re-election in November, Hodges said the city must embrace the discomfort of transformation, a theme of her campaign, and work tirelessly to create One Minneapolis that works for everyone, and where everyone contributes to making the city work for everyone else. She invoked the metaphor of the seed, breaking apart to make way for new life, to describe whats happening in Minnesotas largest city. Minneapolis, our shell is cracked. And from that will come the full flower of our potential, whatever we are destined to be, Hodges said. To some, who can only see this moment, it may indeed look like complete destruction. In reality, it is transformation. In the mayoral campaign, Hodges faces several competitors, including DFL state Rep. Ray Dehn, Nekima Levy-Pounds, Council Member Jacob Frey, Tom Hoch and Aswar Rahman. She made a point of giving the annual speech at Masjid An-Nur Mosque of the Light at 1729 Lyndale Av. N., in an effort to reassure the citys Muslim community that she and the city stand with them despite the antagonism of Muslims by the Trump administration37 More Obama Holdovers Flushed Out of Jeff Sessions Justice Department38 After both the director and deputy director of the Executive Office of Immigration Review EOIR resigned Friday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions named James McHenry acting director. Director Juan Osuna and Deputy Director Ana Kocur, both appointed by former President Barack Obama, announced their resignations Friday in an email to all EOIR employees, according to a report in Politico. No reason appears to be given for their resignations, but the pair reportedly will depart the agency, which oversees all the Department of Justices immigration judges, at the end of the month.39 New 80M Anti-Trump Network Spearheaded by Soros Funded Org With Former ACORN Employees40 A new 80 million anti-Trump network is being led by an organization whose top funder is liberal billionaire George Soros and which employs former members of the controversial and now-defunct Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now ACORN. The Center for Popular Democracy Action Fund, the 501c4 sister organization of the Center for Popular Democracy CPD, a New York-based nonprofit that receives the bulk of its funding from George Soros, announced at their spring gala Tuesday that they will be heading up the new 80 million anti-Trump network that will span 32 states and have 48 local partners, CNN reported.41 Rand Paul Paris Climate Deal Would Kill 6 Million American Jobs42 I think it would be terrible for our country. Sen. Rand Paul R-KY, a leading ally of President Donald Trumps in the U.S. Senate, told Breitbart News exclusively in an interview in his office this week that at least six million U.S. jobs are at risk if President Trump does not pull out of the leftist Paris climate deal.43 Reports Prominent Democratic Leader, Bill De Blasio Staffer Arrested on Child Pornography Charges44 Police arrested a prominent Democratic leader and staff member for New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on child pornography charges, according to the New York Post.45 Richmond Man Arrested After Fatal Virginia State Police Shooting46 WASHINGTON  An arrest has been made after the fatal shooting of a Virginia State Police special agent in Richmond. Travis Ball, 27, was arrested in Virginias Northern Neck just after 6 a.m. Saturday. Virginia State Police said Special Agent Michael Walter, 45, was riding along with a Richmond city police officer around 730 p.m. Friday. Walter and the officer noticed a Chevrolet Cobalt pull up to a curb in the 1900 block of Redd Street in the citys East End, just east of downtown. The Richmond officer spoke with the driver and Walter went to talk to Ball, who was sitting in the passenger side. Police said that within moments, a single shot was fired, and Ball then ran from the car on foot. The Richmond officer immediately called for medical assistance and went to help Walter, who had been injured. The driver of the car stayed at the scene and was detained by Richmond police, officials said. They did not say whether the driver will face any charges. Walter succumbed to his injuries shortly after 5 a.m. Saturday at VCU Medical Center in Richmond. After the shooting, police set up a perimeter in the neighborhood to protect residents, preserve the crime scene and ideally find Ball. Tips eventually led police to find Ball at a home in Northumberland County on Virginias Northern Neck about 11 hours later47 Villains in Upcoming Video Game Are White Christian Right-Wing Extremists FromMontana48 Americans cast as enemies in Far Cry 5 A shocking promotional illustration features a group of flannel-wearing bearded rednecks sat around a table in poses similar to that of Jesus Last Supper. see below The characters are armed and a slew of guns are strewn across the table with apple pie, a bible and red meat nearby. A bound and beaten man with the word SINNER carved into his back sits in front. The image calls to mind the 2016 occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Range, in which armed militants in cowboy hats and rugged button-downs seized the headquarters of the park located in Harney County, Oregon, writes The Verge. Though its likely work began on Far Cry 5 before the incident, as video games takes years to conceptualize, greenlight, and develop. Far Cry 5 stands out as its the first in the series to let gamers mow down Americans albeit fictitious, not mutants or foreigners. Comment Indoctrination disguised as a video game. The hate in the video game will permeate into the players real world view of Americans. This is by design. Seems globalists and their communist buddies seek to politicize everything. Suppose the game demonized muslim or depicted gays as rabidly militant? Imagine the outcry against farcry. 49 White Supremacist Kills Two Good Samaritans by Slitting Their Throats as They Try to Defend Woman in a Hijab After He Started Yelling Anti-Muslim Slurs50 A Portland man known for hate speech is in custody in connection with the stabbings on a light-rail train that left two people dead and another injured after they tried to intervene as the suspect launched anti-Muslim slurs at two young women on Friday night. Jeremy Joseph Christian, 35, has been charged with two counts of aggravated murder, two counts of second-degree intimidation and one count each of aggravated murder and being a felon in possession of a restricted firearm, reported KOIN 6. One of the two victims has been identified by his mother as Taliesin Myrddin in a touching tribute posted to Facebook. Asha Deliverance wrote Taliesin Myrddin Namkai Meche, My dear baby boy passed on yesterday while protecting two young Muslim girls from a racist man on the train in Portland. He was a hero and will remain a hero on the other side of the veil. Shining bright star I love you forever. Christian is known for hate-speech, and is a self-identified white supremacist who was pictured on April 29, referring to himself as the Lizard King and giving Nazi salutes at a free speech rally, with an American Revolutionary War flag tied like a cape around his shoulders5152 Zbigniew Brzezinski, US Cold War National Security Advisor, Dies at 8953 Brzezinski inadvertently helped create Al-Qaeda Zbigniew Brzezinski, one of the most influential US political thinkers at the height of the Cold War, has died aged 89, according to his daughter. The advocate of US hegemony, Brzezinski, authored numerous proposals to bring down the Soviet Union. My father passed away peacefully tonight, his daughter and MSNBC anchor Mika Brzezinski wrote. There was no word of the cause of death. Arming the Mujahideen in Afghanistan to bleed the Soviets, transforming Iran into an anti-Western republic, and the brokering of the Camp David Accords  are among the best known outcomes of his strategies. Brzezinski inadvertently helped create Al-Qaeda, when he convinced President Carter that running a secret CIA program to launch a proxy-war against the USSR-backed Afghan government was going to induce a Soviet military intervention.54 Another Revenue Neutral Carbon Tax Thats Anything But55 Did you really believe them when they said it would be revenue neutral? Last week, the Trudeau government announced a technical paper on its proposed federal carbon tax which suggests it will mimic Albertas carbon tax plan, quashing the optimism of those who believed the federal government when they said their carbon tax would be revenue neutral. The federal government had long insisted its plan would be revenue neutral for the federal government, with any revenue generated staying in the province where the tax is imposed. Last October, Saskatchewan-based federal Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, said publicly of the planned federal carbon tax that every single penny remains in Saskatchewan and under Saskatchewans control. The Saskatchewan government was highly skeptical-as it turns out, for good reason. When Albertas government announced its own multi-billion-dollar carbon tax, Premier Rachel Notley and other ministers tried to spin the tax as revenue neutral. In all previous uses of this term, it meant that every dollar raised by the government would be returned to taxpayers. The Alberta governments new definition was that every dollar they take from Albertans would be spent by the Alberta government. By that definition, every tax in Canadian history would be considered revenue neutral.56 Elites Using Terror Attacks to TraumatizeMind Control Public57 Terrorism being used as excuse for martial law Caller from Germany reminds us what we are dealing with as far as terrorist attacks are concerned and warns us how the elite will use them as mind control to get the public to usher in a draconian authoritarian style government to feel safe.58 Establishment Censoring Commentary on Manchester Bombing59 Thought police blocking public debate over terrorisms root causes Commentary in the wake of Mondays bombing jihad in Manchester is being carefully patrolled, and politically incorrect voices of dissent are being crushed as the UK thought police seek to disguise the root causes of successive terrorist attacks on UK soil. Prominent journalist and talk show host Katie Hopkins has been forced to leave Leading Britains Conversation LBC radio after comments and tweets she made this week were reported to Metropolitan Police, who launched an investigation into the matter. LBC and Katie Hopkins have agreed that Katie will leave LBC effective immediately, said an LBC spokesman. The news of Hopkins departure from LBC comes just days after it was discovered that authorities were actively investigating the Daily Mail columnist for her inflammatory tweets. Hopkins first tweeted, then deleted, about the need for a final solution to the slew of jihadist attacks in the UK, later posting a less implicated call for action from Western men. Hopkins clarified her meaning of final solution in an interview with Tucker Carlson, saying, What I meant was, we need a lasting solution  a resolution to this. Both tweets were forwarded to the Met Contact Center by an authoritarian leftist who threatened Hopkins with a spell behind bars.60 Europe Living the Time Machine61 Like in the H.G. Wells classic, The Time Machine, Europe is living the fictional nightmare of being led to the slaughter, unable or unwilling to grasp the gravity of their predicament. They have opened their borders to millions of immigrants with a vastly different culture and belief system. Many are nothing more than cave-dwelling Morlocks feeding on Europes submissive and compliant citizenry. Numerous other migrants and their offspring demonstrate resistance and downright refusal to assimilate, living in their own little Morlock world of suspicion and hate. The leaders of Europe doggedly assure their people that everything is normal. The mayor of Manchester mutters Its business as usual. Business as usual? Is this what it has come tototal acquiescencethe new normal? Most leaders in Europe, and many in America, have proven themselves to be impotent. People die violent deaths while they strut around as if they have the answers, but they have no answers. They have no solutions. France had the opportunity to confront their situation in their recent presidential election, but chose to take a higher roadthe road of denial, the road of living in the dream world where you confront the people who want to kill you with, as Katy Perry recently said, the greatest thing we can do is just unite and love on each other. No barriers, no borders, we all just need to co-exist. These are people that truly believe the greatest threat we face is not ISIS or al-Qaeda, but climate change. These are not rational people. They refuse to accept and confront what is plainly in front of them, especially the ones who live behind walled mansions. They do not belong in leadership or influential positions. They belong in theoretical think tanks where they can only inspire each other.62 Only 7 of 3,000 Extremists in Britain Are Under Anti-Terror Orders Thanks to Lib Dems63 Only seven extremists have been placed under anti-terror orders watered down at the behest of the LibDems despite there being at least 3,000 fanatics at large in Britain. The so-called T-Pims  Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures  are the toughest tool the security services have to restrict the activities of terror plotters and sympathisers. They replaced the more restrictive Control Orders which were axed in 2011 at the bidding of then Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg following a row over human rights.64 The Dystopian Principles of Real Communism65 A deleterious philosophy based on struggle and destruction In the age of social justice and other progressive creeds in prevailing Western discourse, the tragedies of millions of people in dozens of countries living under communist regimes are too often passed off as not being real communism. While many still view communism as a noble philosophy that may yet be implemented given improvements in technology or human nature, its ideological foundations depict not a utopian dream but a necessarily violent and destructive teaching. Since its emergence, communist ideologies have promoted violent revolution and brutal dictatorships far outstripping the worst excesses of non-communist governments. Today, the five communist regimes that still existChina, North Korea, Vietnam, Cuba, and Laosare among the worlds worst human rights offenders.66 The Dark Origins of Communism Part 1 of 367 How the murderers of Frances Reign of Terror became Karl Marxs inspiration  Built on the ideas of Babeuf, a new secret society known as the League of Outlaws soon emerged in Paris. A German tailor named Wilhelm Weitling joined the society after arriving in Paris in 1835, according to Priestland, and soon became one of the best known communist figures of the 1840s. Weitling took Babeufs ideas of violent revolution, state-enforced equality, and the destruction of ownership and, according to Priestland, infused these with his own ideas of a Christian apocalyptic vision. Under him, the League of Outlaws also changed its name to the League of the Just. Many radical secret societies existed in Europe at the time, and many figures and newspapers were spreading the new ideas of socialism and communism. This held especially true in Paris, which saw many attempted revolutions throughout the 1800s. The League of the Just joined the May 1839 Blanquist rebellion, led by Louis Auguste Blanqui. He would later become leader of what may be regarded as the first communist government, the Paris Commune of 1871, which waged a program of killing and destruction that in just over two months left tens of thousands dead and an estimated quarter of Paris and its cultural relics in ruins.68 The Paris Commune When the Specter Came to Earth69 Like a funnel cloud longing to touch Earth and become a tornado, the specter of Communism was up in the air, with no Earthly home, haunting Europe in early 1871. The Paris Commune, a bloody insurrection covering 73 days, became Communisms first Earthly home, like a tornado touching down. The specter was embodied. There is a specter haunting Europe, wrote Karl Marx in The Communist Manifesto. In Paris, this specter gained the foothold from which it could wreak its own lethal tornado of destruction and killing for decades to come. The Paris Commune was shortly endorsed by Marx as the first proletariat revolution, or dictatorship of the proletariat. Its influence as a model echoed all the way to Lenin and Mao, who studied and learned lessons from it.70 UK Terrorism Threat Reduced After Wave of Police Raids Targeting Jihadi Networks71 British Prime Minister Theresa May reduced the terrorism threat level in the UK from critical to severe Saturday, with armed soldiers patrolling streets across the country to be withdrawn beginning Monday evening.72 UK Open Your Eyes Family of Manchester Bombing Victim Warn Government of Terror Deaths73 In a statement praising 18-year-old Georgina and thanking the emergency services for their response to the horrific incident, her family lashed out at the Governments handling of terror threats. The statement, released via Greater Manchester Police, said I wish I could say that Georgina is one of the last to die in this way but unless our Government opens its eyes we know we are only another in a long line of parents on a list that continues to grow.74 UK Bombers Childhood Friend Became a Gang Rapist Pal is in Jail for Luring a Girl, 16, Into Hotel Room and Raping Her With a Mob of Attackers75 Manchester concert bomber Salman Abedi used to hang around with Bilal Ahmed, who is now serving a nine-year prison sentence for luring a schoolgirl into a hotel room and raping her along with a mob of attackers. Last year the Daily Mail told the harrowing story of the gangs victim, a private schoolgirl who said she kept quiet during the terrifying attack because she feared the consequences of protesting. I just stayed quiet because I thought they would kill me if I screamed, she said. Any one of them could have had a knife. Nobody else knew I was there. I kept thinking they could kill me and nobody would know. The girl, a gifted musician who had little experience with boys, was introduced to the group from South Manchesters Somali community  among them Ahmed plus Muhyadeen Osman and Mowled Yussuf  by a mutual friend in 2013.76 UK Manchester Jihadi Spoke to His Nuclear Scientist Mother, 50, On the Phone Just Before His Deadly Attack77 Bomber Salman Adebi spoke to his nuclear scientist mother on the phone in Tripoli shortly before he detonated the device on Monday night. A Libyan security source told the BBCs Newsnight that Abedi rang his brother in Libya, telling him to get their mother Samia Tabbal to call him. Salman Abedi, the suicide bomber who took the lives of 22 people in Manchester. His mother is a graduate who left Tripoli University at the top of her class News sources in the US, citing intelligence officials, have said Abedis mother was fearful her son had been radicalised. It has also been claimed that she told authorities her son had been radicalised.78 UK Manchester Bomber Accused His Teacher of Islamophobia79 Manchester bomber Salman Abedi was once part of a ring of Muslim students who accused their teacher of being Islamophobic, The Times Of London reported Saturday. The accusation came after the teacher asked the class sometime between 2009 and 2011 what they thought of someone who blow themselves up in a suicide attack. A group went to complain to their RE teacher saying it was Islamophobic, an associate of Abedis told TheTOL.80 UK Police Helicopter Deployed, Karaoke Machine Confiscated After Song Mocking Bin Laden Played at Party81 A British police officer was moved to activate her panic button after taking offence at a parody song making fun of former Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden being played at a garden party, bringing in serious re-enforcements to a small English village. The officer pressed the panic button on her body-mounted camera after being dispatched to a garden party in a picturesque Cambridgeshire village at around 10pm on Thursday and overhearing a song being played that mocked Osama Bin Laden. Responding to the call for help, the local force dispatched another ten officers and a police helicopter, Cambridge News reports. It is alleged that in addition to the parody song making fun of the dead terrorist, party-goers were also shouting anti-Islamic abuse, a suggestion the partygoers deny. Mark Donovan, who attended the party in the Cambridge village  which dates back to the time of the Domesday Book  spoke to the paper after the incident, and said We was having a summers evening in my neighbours garden as we dont have one. We had our karaoke machine on playing music through our phones from YouTube which are all approved songs.8283 Gaddafi Predicted and Tried to Stop This Terror Wave in UK, So the US Murdered Him84 Outspoken critic of Big Government and former U.S. presidential candidate, Dr. Ron Paul, blasted the West for ignoring admonishments from deposed, late, Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi, who asserted prior to his death, the rise of U.S.-supported Islamic extremists would lead to attacks on Europe  years before Salman Abedi detonated an explosive device, killing 22 at a concert in Manchester. Children, adolescents, and adults had gathered for a concert by pop superstar Ariana Grande and had begun to exit the Manchester venue when Abedi exploded a shrapnel-laden device  causing pandemonium, severely injuring scores, and killing 22 people. Could the Manchester attack have been prevented  even long before MI5 also warned an incident may be forthcoming? On the Liberty Report, Daniel McAdams noted, Gaddafi  when the radicals had started rising in Eastern Libya, when the U.S. was supporting them  he said, Im telling you guys, these are radical Islamists, these are terrorists, if you keep supporting them, theres gonna be trouble. McAdams and Dr. Paul cited an article from January, 2016, from the Telegraph, titled, Colonel Gaddafi warned Tony Blair of Islamist attacks on Europe, phone conversations reveal, in which the content of communications between the two leaders revealed how precisely the ill-fated leader of Libya prognosticated future blowback from current Western support of radicals. Apparently lucid enough to grasp the ramifications Western support would effect throughout Europe  in the aiding terrorists to fit its own ends  on February 25, 2011, Gaddafi portended the dark turn in a phone conversation with former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair, cautioning, They jihadists want to control the Mediterranean and then they will attack Europe.85 ISIS Claims Responsibility for Deadly Attack on Coptic Christians in Egypt86 Islamic State terrorists ISIS have claimed responsibility for the attack Friday on a group of Coptic Christians in Egypt that killed at least 29 and left more than 20 others wounded. In a statement following the attack, ISIS leaders claimed its terrorists were responsible for the attack, and Egypts military countered immediately with an attack on what it said were ISIS terrorist camps in eastern Libya.87 Indonesia Makes Arrests as Islamic State Claims Jakarta Attacks88 Indonesian police arrested three people on Friday suspected of being linked to suicide bombings in Jakarta, as the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attacks that killed three police officers at a bus station and wounded 12 others. The attack was the deadliest in Indonesia since January 2016, when eight people were killed, four of them attackers, after bombers and gunmen attacked the capital Jakarta.89 Invasion Officials Confirm Foreigners Fighting for Islamic State in 90 Christian Philippines90 Government officials in the Philippines have confirmed that some terrorists fighting with the Maute group and Abu Sayyaf, both Islamic State affiliates, are foreigners who traveled to the country to help the jihadists establish themselves.91 10,000 Migrants Rescued, Dozens Drown Trying to Reach Italy From Libya This Week92 Nearly 10,000 migrants were rescued off the coasts of Italy and Libya this week, as the leaders of G7 gathered for a summit coincidentally held in Sicily.

He is said to have hung around the Reumannplatz area from November to February in the evenings and at night to find his victims, Die Presse reports.95 Migrant Mass Brawl Turns Quiet Austrian City Into Chaos96 A mass brawl of around 30 migrants from Afghanistan and other Arab countries turned a quiet area in the Austrian city of Linz into chaos, frightening local residents. At 920 am on Thursday morning, residents in the residential area on Böhmerwaldstrasse in the Austrian city of Linz phoned police as around 30 migrants started brawling in the area. One restaurant owner was forced to barricade his establishment to protect his customers from the violence, Kronen Zeitung reports.97 Spain Saves 157 Migrants in 5 Boats Crossing From Africa98 MADRID AP  Spains maritime rescue service has saved 157 migrants from five small boats attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea.

ROCK HILL, S.C.  New warrants released Friday reveal what York County deputies found as they investigated the deadly shooting in Rock Hill earlier in April that left four members of a beloved family dead along with two HVAC technicians, and resulted in deputies discovering the suspect turned the gun on himself afterward. The York County Sheriffs Office released the warrants on April 23, which largely detailed their search of the home where Phillip Adams, the man deputies say carried out the shooting, was living at the time with his parents. Adams, a former NFL football player from Rock Hill, shot and killed six people, including Dr. Robert Lesslie, his wife, Barbara, and their two grandkids, before taking his own life after an hours-long standoff with police earlier this month, officials said. Additionally, the two technicians from Gastonia working at the Lesslie home fell victim to the gunfire James Lewis died on the scene, while Robert Shook passed away from his injuries days later. The warrants revealed York County deputies spoke to a witness who claimed to see Phillip Adams shoot two the HVAC workers outside the home on Marshall Road before going inside, where hes said to have killed the four other family members. The witness claimed to hear multiple gunshots and see the suspect walk into the woods, according to the documentation. A Rock Hill Police officer responding to the scene said he saw a person matching Adams description on an ATV driving away from the scene, according to narratives attached to the warrants. They also revealed Adams left his cell phone at the scene. Adams was later found dead inside the familys home from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. During a search of Adams home, detectives found multiple notebooks with cryptic writing and emblems written in them. Its unclear if these writings are connected to a motive for the shooting, but deputies say they learned he was possibly following a new religion or ideology and had been acting differently recently. Deputies also found numerous weapons, including guns resembling sub-machine guns and rifle-style firearms, along with about two dozen shell casings. The sheriffs office executed a search warrant at Riverview Family Medicine, where Dr. Lesslie practiced, on April 13. However, deputies say they found no indication Adams was a patient, and as of now have not figured out a motive for the killings. Investigators are trying to gain access to a locked safe belonging to Adams. Deputies believe there could be more evidence inside of it.50 Deadly Police Shooting in Hollywood Shuts Down Sunset Boulevard51 The LAPD confirmed a police shooting took place but did not immediately provide any details on what led to the shooting or whether anyone was injured or killed.

The fact that he was able to make that decision based on what he saw and his training so quickly that it possibly saved the lives of other peopleit was pretty unreal, he said.

The seizure of Infidel girls and their use as sex slaves is sanctioned in the Quran. According to Islamic law, Muslim men can take captives of the right hand Quran 43, 424, 3350. The Quran says O Prophet! Lo! We have made lawful for you your wives to whom you have paid their dowries, and those whom your right hand possesses of those whom Allah has given you as spoils of war 3350. 43 and 424 extend this privilege to Muslim men in general. The Quran says that a man may have sex with his wives and with these slave girls The believers must win through, those who humble themselves in their prayers who avoid vain talk who are active in deeds of charity who abstain from sex, except with those joined to them in the marriage bond, or the captives whom their right hands possess, for in their case they are free from blame. Quran 231-6132 Exclusive Interview Remigration is the Only Solution to the Problem Posed by Mass Immigration,  Says Spokesman of Banned Generation Identity133 You were Gnration Identitaires spokesperson, but on March 3 the government banned your organization. What does this mean in practice? Gnration identitaire is no longer active. The ban was pronounced in the Council of Ministers and we have filed two cases against that decision with the Council of State, which is Frances highest administrative court the first one is a petition for suspension with the aim of suspending the ban for the time it will take the Council of State to rule over our second case concerning the legality of the ban. The petition for suspension will be judged on April 30 and we will then know whether Gnration Identitaire will be able to continue its activity during the proceedings, which could last at least six months to a year. Do you have confidence in the Council of State as the highest instance of administrative justice? Many in France believe that the Council of State is not totally independent of the government. That is a pretty hard question to answer. If the judgment is rendered based on the law, we are extremely confident. However, if politics takes precedence over the law, then we have every reason to be concerned. In theory, the Council of State is supposed to base its rulings on the law, and we will have a first look at this on April 30. The ruling on our petition for suspension procedure will be decided on collegially by three judges, which happens extremely rarely since most often there is only one judge to make such a decision. This shows that the case is taken very seriously.134 Amsterdam Man Cleared of Planning Terror Attack on Gay Pride135 A 32-year-old man from Amsterdam has been sentenced to five months in jail to be followed by compulsory psychiatric treatment for making threats against gay people, Jews and the police on social media but was found not guilty of planning a terrorist attack. The prosecution had said Tahsin E was planning to carry out a terrorist attack on last summers Gay Pride boat parade, and had undergone terrorism training. But judges ruled they were not convinced Tahsin E actually had terrorist intent or that he had taken part in a training exercise. Police were alerted to Es plans by the Dutch security service AIVD and the FBI last year and he was arrested on August 7. A search of his home in Amsterdam turned up several telephones, a quantity of hydrogen peroxide and injection needles.136 Sec. of State Allows Flying Rainbow Flag on Same Pole as U.S. Flag at Embassies Worldwide137 Secretary of State Antony Blinken has approved flying the rainbow LGBT pride flag on the same flag pole as the American flag at U.S. embassies and consulates worldwide.138  1 451420  2 451387  3 451388  4 451426  5 451440  6 451424  7 451460  8 451454  9 451476  10 451416  11 451408  12 451400  13 451458  14 451398  15 451412  16 451392  17 451386  18 451452  19 451456  20 451404  21 451394  22 451448  23 451390  24 451472  25 451402  26 451410  27 451468  28 451434  29 451464  30 451474  31 451470  32 451430  33 451466  34 451406  35 451414  36 451396  37 451462  38 451436  39 451432  40 451418  41 451444  42 451446  43 451442  44 451428  45 451438  46 451422  47  48 topheadline  49  50 topheadline  51  52 topheadline  53  54 topheadline  55  56 topheadline  57  58 topheadline  59  60 topheadline  61  62 topheadline  63  64 topheadline  65  66 topheadline  67  68 topheadline  69  70 topheadline  71  72 topheadline  73  74 topheadline  75  76 topheadline  77  78 topheadline  79  80 topheadline  81  82 topheadline  83  84 topheadline  85  86 topheadline  87  88 topheadline  89  90 topheadline  91  92 topheadline  93  94 topheadline  95  96 topheadline  97  98 topheadline  99  100 topheadline  101  102 topheadline  103  104 topheadline  105  106 topheadline  107  108 topheadline  109  110 topheadline  111  112 topheadline  113  114 topheadline  115  116 topheadline  117  118 topheadline  119  120 topheadline  121  122 topheadline  123  124 topheadline  125  126 topheadline  127  128 topheadline  129  130 topheadline  131  132 topheadline  133  134 topheadline  135  136 topheadline  137  138 topheadline",homeless

Destatis said that the German public debt rose by 11.1, or 210.1 billion euros, compared with the end of 2019. The former record high of 2,068.3 billion euros was measured on 31 December 2012. The increase is mainly due to the fact that the public budgets borrowed funds for the purpose of financing measures to overcome the coronavirus crisis, Destatis noted. The data on public debt refers to the debts of the overall public budget Federation, regions, municipalitiesassociations of municipalities and social security funds including all extra budgets to the non-public sector credit institutions and the remaining domestic and non-domestic sector.117 U.S. Adds 661,000 Jobs in September and Unemployment Rate Falls to 7.9118 The numbers The U.S. created 661,000 new jobs in September and the unemployment rate fell again to 7.9 to the lowest level of the pandemic, but the gain in hiring was the smallest since the economy reopened and pointed to deceleration in the recovery.119 11 Children Recovered in New Orleans During U.S. Marshals Operation Summer Rescue120 Eleven children were recovered by the U.S. Marshals in a two-month rescue operation in New Orleans called Operation Summer Rescue 2020, which focused on missing and endangered runaways. U.S. Marshals said several arrests were made during the childrens recoveries over the operation, which ran from August 1 to September 30.121 A Swarm of Nearly 600 Earthquakes Rattles Southern California as Speculation About The Big One Starts to Rise Again122 Over the last few days, a swarm of almost 600 earthquakes has shaken southern California, and a lot of people are becoming extremely concerned about what will happen next. In fact, if you go on Twitter right now you will find a tremendous amount of speculation that the Big One could be coming. The experts are trying to calm the general public by assuring them that it is probably not likely that the Big One is imminent, but they dont know for sure. Forecasting earthquakes is not like forecasting the weather, and experts will continue to tell us that a major event is not likely until the day when one finally happens. But what everyone can agree upon is that earthquake swarms cause the probability of a major event to rise. Of course that doesnt mean that there will be a major event associated with this current earthquake swarm, and there may not be a major event if an earthquake swarm occurs next month. But without a doubt what is going on in southern California right now is worth watching.123 America and Freedom Hangs in the Balance124 The Crossroads of American History Have you looked around America lately? Do you even recognize the nation that you grew up in? How could a nation founded on Christian principles so easily yield to the forces of darkness? How has THE CHURCH become so oblivious to what is going on around us? How can we not understand that the Devil is trying to destroy everything that is good? How can we not understand that what we are facing is a war for the very soul of this nation? The battle is not POLITICALbut it involves politics. This is the most consequential moment in American historyat least since the signing of the Declaration of Independence. AMERICA IS AT WAR!125 Anti-Defamation League Circulates Petition Urging Jews to Denounce Trump126 The Anti-Defamation League ADL is circulating a petition among Jewish organizations urging them to criticize President Donald Trump for failing to denounce white supremacy during the first presidential debate on Tuesday  though he did so then, and has done so, often, before.127 AP Style Guide Warns Reporters Not to Describe Democrat Riots as Riots128 Left-leaning news org coordinates reporting to cover for radical leftist violence.129 As Many as 50 of NYCs Bars, Restaurants May Close Permanently Amid Continued COVID-19 Restrictions130 As many as half of New York Citys bars and restaurants may close for good in the next six months, according to a newly released report by the states comptroller. The citys restaurant industry has been operating under severe restrictions for months and were allowed to resume indoor dining just this week at a maximum capacity of 25.131 Black Proud Boys Destroy Left-Wing Lies, Denounce White Supremacy132 We are not a white supremacist group.133 California Gov. Newsom Changes Reopening Rules Again, Adds Racial Equity Measures134 Californias Governor Gavin Newsom, who is Nancy Pelosis nephew, is once again moving the goalposts in order to keep his state shut down, imposing irrelevant criteria to delay recovery. He has become an economic troll. With his state accounting for almost 15 of the national GDP, hobbling his states economy, even as counties are already starting to meet the criteria he set for relaxation of restrictions, depresses national output and employment statistics and thereby contributes to defeating President Trump.135 Caroline Glick Democrats and the Politics of Projection136 The set-up at the Presidential debate Tuesday night was so predictable that it hurt to watch. Moderator Chris Wallace made no effort to hide where he was going. He noted that President Donald Trump had repeatedly demanded that his opponent, Democratic nominee and former vice president Joe Biden condemn Antifa, the violent leftist group behind much of the ongoing destruction of Americas cities. Wallace failed to note that Biden refused to condemn Antifa and instead claimed, crazily that the organization is an idea not a group. Wallace then asked Trump to condemn white supremacists and militia groups, and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities. Sure, Im willing to do that, Trump replied. He then added, Almost everything I see is from the left wing, not the right wing. Trump was right, of course. The rioting, looting, arson the attacks on police, on business owners and on citizens sitting in their homes from Los Angeles to Kenosha to Washington, DC is the provenance of Antifa, BlackLivesMatter and related left-wing groups. Then, going back to Wallaces question, Trump added, Im willing to do anything. I want to see peace. That didnt satisfy Wallace, or Biden, who were tag-teaming the issue. The two demanded that Trump condemn. Trump asked who specifically they wanted him to condemn. Wallace said, White supremacists and militias. Biden  who wouldnt condemn the leftist terrorists laying waste to Americas urban centers  said, Proud Boys. So Trump, trying to resonate Wallaces request that he tell them to stand down, said, Proud Boys, stand back and stand by. And the progressive media and Jewish progressive activists clapped their hands in glee. Here was the definitive proof that Trump is a white supremacist137138 CNN Says Were Never Getting Back to Normal139 CNN has published an article asserting that people need to accept that things are never getting back to normal and that mandatory coronavirus restrictions such as wearing face masks will become permanent. In a piece titled There is no getting back to normal, experts say. The sooner we accept that, the better  CNN international security editor Nick Paton Walsh writes, Things are most likely never going back to normal. Walsh says that the pre-corona world is now mere nostalgia and that the public needs to come to terms with it.140 CNNs Don Lemon Suggests Trump Said Coronavirus Was a Hoax141 CNNs Don Lemon reacted to President Trumps announcement that he had tested positive for coronavirus by suggesting it was payback for Trump calling the virus a hoax, something that never happened. The remark was made during Lemons discussion with the networks chief medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta.142 Could Trumps Coronavirus Test be a False Positive?143 Despite numerous reports from respected public health bodies acknowledging that up to 90 of those testing positive for coronavirus may be wrongly diagnosed, no one is asking whether that could be case when it comes to President Trumps COVID-19 infection. Trump announced via Twitter that he and Melania had tested positive for the virus, prompting a wave of celebration and gloating from leftists who believe it will harm his re-election chances.144 Court Nicholas Sandmann Lawsuits Against NY Times, ABC, CBS, And Rolling Stone Can Go Forward145 Nicholas Sandmann filed suit against numerous media entities after the false and misleading portrayals of him and his interaction with a Native American activist who banged a drum inches from Sandmanns face. Sandmann settled with CNN and WaPo for undisclosed amounts, his suit against NBC survived a motion to dismiss, and there is a pending motion to dismiss in his suit against Gannett. In an important series of rulings, the federal judge handling the cases just entered orders denying motions to dismiss his cases against the NY Times, ABC, CBS, and Rolling Stone. So those cases will move forward.146 COVID-19 Case Number Lies Continue147 A record number of COVID-19 cases were reported on September 24 in Alabama. Just two labs reported that there were 2,451 positive test results, but those included old numbers. The lies continue as those who seek ultimate power and control try to lie their way through this scamdemic. At this point, no numbers from any mainstream media source or government agency should be trusted. Theres more than enough evidence to prove this is all manipulated in order to push fear on the public.148 Declassified Intelligence Report Reveals Hillary Clinton Hatched the Russia Hoax149 According to a report obtained by the National Association of Chiefs of Police NACOP, in response to Grahams request for oversight of the reliability of the Steele dossier, the Justice Department recently declassified a key footnote in Inspector General Horowitzs report. The footnote states Christopher Steeles Primary Sub-source was the subject of an FBI counterintelligence investigation from 2009 to 2011 that assessed hisher documented contacts with suspected Russian intelligence officers. To me, failure of the FBI to inform the court that the Primary Sub-source was suspected of being a Russian agent is a breach of every duty owed by law enforcement to the judicial system, said Ratcliffe. The FBI summary provided to the committee reveals that the Crossfire Hurricane team was aware of this information in December 2016, yet failed to inform the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in their affidavits for surveillance warrants on four occasions.150 Downtown Portland Jewelry Store Intends to Sue City for Handling of Protests151 PORTLAND, Ore.  A downtown Portland jewelry store owner intends to sue the City of Portland for its handling of protests in late May. Noha Kassab, CEO of Kassab Jewelers, said her family-owned store was was broken into and looted early in the morning on May 30. This was during the beginning stages of what would lead to more than 100 days of protest in Portland. I started looking on my phone to see who was in my store, it was bunch of people going into the store, broke glass, it was the most painful, disheartening experience I ever faced, said Kassab. The store owner said they are still calculating the costs, but estimates 2.5 million in damages.152 Downtown Portland Businesses How Many Open, Closed or Empty153 PORTLAND, Ore. KOIN  Amid the pandemic, protests and a homeless crisis, downtown Portlands reputation has been the center of some controversy over the last few months. The Downtown Portland Clean amp38 Safe recently conducted a survey of businesses within the 213 blocksthat make up the area. They said they surveyed 718 retail and restaurants throughout the month of September. Their survey found there were over 430 businesses still open, some by appointment only or with adjusted hours. 170 businesses were temporarily closed, or only doing online shopping. Over 20 businesses had permanently closed, and there were over 80 retail locations that were not occupied.154 Federal Affidavit Details Accused New York Rioters Ties to Antifa155 An upstate New York suspect is facing federal charges for instructing their comrades to make firebombs to harm police in one of the few known cases where federal prosecutors explicitly detail the accuseds ties to Antifa. The U.S. Attorneys Office for the Western District of New York charged 27-year-old Ryan Howe, of Rochester, last week with using a facility of interstate and foreign commerce to incite, promote and encourage a riot. Howewho uses the pronouns theythem and sheheris also known as Rylea Autumn.156 Flashback Chris Wallace Mocked Trump in 1988 Interview157 For those wondering whether Chris Wallaces disastrous moderator performance during Tuesday nights debate had anything to do with his personal beef with President Trump, a 1988 interview provides some context. As we previously highlighted, Wallace constantly interrupted the president while interjecting while Biden was speaking 5 times less frequently.158 Florida Man Friday In Which Colorado, New Jersey, And Especially Louisiana All Outdo Florida159 We have never needed Florida Man Friday more than right now. There hasnt been much we could count on in 2020, between infectious disease, poisonous politics, a deliberately tanked economy, and a universe that has become practically mirthful  not to mention merciless  in its unpredictability. But there is one thing you can depend upon, week in and week out. And thats Floridas glorious sunshine law, shining its bright light on the very people who let you say At least it wasnt me. So chins up, people, and join me on another Florida Man Friday!160 Former Twitter CEO Says Some Capitalists Going to be the First To be Shot in the Revolution161 Twitter has not flagged or removed the tweet Former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo said some capitalists are going to be the first to be shot in the revolution in a tweet Wednesday.162 Former Twitter CEO Calls for Political Enemies to be Lined Up Against the Wall and Shot163 Former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo has publicly called for people who disagree with him to be lined up against the wall and shot. But theres no Big Tech bias, honest! Me-first capitalists who think you can separate society from business are going to be the first people lined up against the wall and shot in the revolution. Ill happily provide video commentary, tweeted Costolo. Mike Cernovich pointed out that Costolo was in violation of Twitters own rules regarding the glorification of violence.164 Gov.

According to the Associated Press, the audio includes officers testimony that they knocked on Taylors door multiple times and announced the police presence before entering.170 If Democrats Take the White House and Congress in November, It Will All be Over for the Republican Party171 This is not a normal election, because if Democrats are able to win the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives in November, they will end the two party system as we know it today. Yes, there will still be two major political parties, but one will essentially be in permanent control. In recent weeks, there has been so much chatter on the left about ending the filibuster in the Senate permanently, about granting statehood to Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, and about packing the Supreme Court. Collectively, these three moves would basically make it exceedingly difficult for Republicans to ever become the majority party again. I know that this is an extreme statement to make, but I think that you will agree with me by the time this article is over. Lets talk about the filibuster in the Senate and statehood for D.C. and Puerto Rico first. When Joy Reid of MSNBC asked Chuck Schumer about these potential moves if Democrats win the Senate, Schumer said that everything is on the table172 L.A. Ordered to Pay NRA Six Figures After Losing First Amendment Case173 A federal court ordered Los Angeles to hand over more than 100,000 to the National Rifle Association after ruling that the city had violated the gun-rights groups First Amendment rights.

On Tuesday, he ordered city officials to pay for the Second Amendment groups attorney fees, which totaled nearly 150,000.174 Leftists Claim Trump Faked His Coronavirus Infection175 After it was announced that President Trump had contracted coronavirus, numerous leftists took to Twitter to vehemently argue that Trump had staged the infection in order to help his re-election chances. The consensus opinion appears to be that Trump being diagnosed with COVID-19 will harm his campaign because it will stop him traveling for 2 weeks and also highlight his supposed hypocrisy over the severity of coronavirus. However, a vocal minority reacted to the news by insisting that the opposite was true, and that Trump staged the whole thing in order to recover quickly from the infection and bolster support for his argument that the threat of COVID-19 has been exaggerated for political reasons.176 Leftists Celebrate Trump COVID Diagnosis177 In news that will come as no surprise to anyone, but needs to be highlighted, leftists everywhere are hyperventilating and celebrating at President Trumps announcement that he and the First Lady have tested positive for Covid-19. Trump broke the news late Thursday.178 Madison Police, Federal Law Enforcement Find No Evidence Biracial Woman Was Attacked179 Madison police announced Friday they have not been able to corroborate allegations made by a biracial Monona woman that she was burned by four white men in Downtown Madison in June in what was initially reported as a hate crime and garnered national and international attention. Althea Bernstein, 18, told police someone sprayed lighter fluid on her and set her on fire in the early morning hours of June 24 after one of the men yelled a racial epithet. But on Friday, the police department said it was closing the case because after an exhaustive probe, detectives were unable to corroborate or locate evidence consistent with what was reported.180 Medical Journal Calls for Mandatory COVID Vaccine Noncompliance Should Incur a Penalty181 A paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine has called for mandating a coronavirus vaccine, and outlined strategies for how Americans could be FORCED to take it. The paper warns that an immediate mandate for the vaccine would spark too much resistance and backlash, so the writers suggest that at first it should be voluntary. However, it suggests that if not enough people are willing to get the vaccine within the first few weeks of its availability, it should be transformed into an obligation, with penalties put into place for refusal.182 Michael Moore Evil Genius Trump Could be Lying About Having COVID to Postpone the Election183 Film maker Michael Moore says that Trump is an evil genius who could be lying about being infected with coronavirus in order to justify postponing the election. In a lengthy Facebook post, Moore outlines why he thinks the White House could be deliberately misleading the American public in announcing that Trump and the First Lady were diagnosed with COVID-19. After claiming that Trump has lied roughly 25,000 times in the last four years, Moore asks, Why on earth would we believe him today? Has he earned your trust now? No Why would Trump all of a sudden just start telling the truth?184 Michigan Police Rescue 25 Missing Children in Sweep185 Michigan State Police announced on Wednesday that it had located 25 missing children from across the Greater Detroit area, including Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb counties. In Operation MISafeKid II, police cross-referenced photos, last known locations, and other identifying information to locate the children, many of whom were at risk for sex trafficking.186 MSNBCs Giridharadas Trump Supporters Are People Who Like Fascism187 MSNBC contributor Anand Giridharadas on Thursday sounded off on his concerns for the 2020 presidential election.

Comment Another communist talking head.188 NBA Finals Ratings Hit Record Low for Lakers-Heat Game 1189 One of the most iconic franchises with one of the leagues all-time great players may be playing in the NBA Finals, but it still wasnt enough for the series opener to avoid the recent trend of rough sports television ratings.

The World Health Organization has long encouraged mass tourism and said closing borders wouldnt stop the spread of Covid-19. A New York Times investigation found this policy was never based on science, but instead on politics and economics, tweeted the NY Times with a link to an article detailing the issue.194 Pennsylvania Union Bosses Struggling to Convince Members to Vote Against Donald Trump195 Union bosses in the swing state of Pennsylvania admit they are struggling to convince their rank-and-file members to vote against President Donald Trump in the upcoming presidential election. As Democrat presidential candidate Joe Biden visited Pennsylvania this week, local reports indicate union bosses are having a difficult time convincing their members to vote against Trump this election cycle. Comment Commies infiltrate unions and, while pretending to fight hard for members, seek to get in a position to run unions.196 Portland on Course to Have Most Deadly Spate of Violence in at Least Six Years197 Four fatal shootings in Portland this week bring the total for the year to 39 homicides  putting the city on a trajectory to have its most deadly spate of violence in six years and prompting an outcry from community leaders who work directly with victims and families affected by the gunfire.

Grand Valley State University GVSU professor Joel Wendland-Liu has written multiple articles for China Global Television Network CGTN, which is owned and operated by the Chinese government. According to detailed reports from the Guardian, Beijing has purchased several media outlets to tell Chinas story well as part of a larger worldwide propaganda campaign. CGTN is one of them.

Gretchen Whitmer violated her constitutional authority by continuing to issue orders to combat COVID-19 without the approval of state lawmakers. The court, in its 71-page ruling, found that Whitmer did not have authority after April 30 to issue or renew any executive orders related to the pandemic under the 1976 Emergency Management Act. The justices also found Whitmer did not possess the authority to exercise emergency powers under the 1945 Emergency Powers of the Governor Act because the act violates the Michigan Constitution.210 Ted Cruz Tells CNN Trump Broke You Guys211 During an appearance on Chris Cuomos show, Senator Ted Cruz lambasted CNN for being obsessed with hating President Trump, telling the host, Donald Trump broke you guys. Speaking about the fallout from Tuesday nights debate, the Texas Senator said Americans were sick of the medias wall to wall fixation with bashing the commander in chief. Chris, there was a time when CNN actually cared about being journalistic and talking about facts  Donald Trump broke you guys, said Cruz.212 The Coming Break Up of America, Part 2213 Thomas W. Chittum, author of, CIVIL WAR II THE COMING BREAKUP OF AMERICA, brings concrete historical evidence to the impending conflicts in America. By looking around, you, the average American, can see this tragedy building. If youre not living in California, Arizona, Colorado, Texas, Miami, Florida, Georgia, New York, Detroit, Michigan and Chicago, Illinois-you might not see it-but its coming and its coming fast. Chittum states, Street gangs will doubtless form the core of future black and Hispanic urban militiasconsider the followingthey are well financed by drug tradethey are ethnically orientedare heavily armedorganized and disciplinedand numerous beyond belief. That statement is born out by latest statistics whereby 29 percent of our state and federal prisons are filled with legal and illegal immigrants. Chittum states, Their leadership is composed of courageous, industrious and intelligent men because promotion is based on leadership, business acumen and application of ruthless violence. When you look at the massive 120 billion annual drug trade infecting this country, its evident. These urban gangs are evolving into serious armies, armies hostile to the established government. Its why 800,000 Californians fled their state last year. In Miami, American citizens fled north. Detroit is fast becoming Arabic exclusively. Fremont, California known as Little Kabul tips toward an exclusive Middle Eastern in population. Los Angeles is no longer an American city. As their numbers grow, police cant touch them because of Special Order 40 which gives them immunity from arrest and deportation. Such Governors as in Maine and Arizonas Governor directly break immigration laws by passing ordinances encouraging more illegal aliens and giving them sanctuary. The governor of Minnesota openly encourages massive illegal alien importation. Hes pushed by meatpacking plant owners who openly hire illegal aliens. Austin, Minnesota suffers from over 3,000 illegal aliens working in the meatpacking plants. Citizens are left without jobs while a few people make millions at the top.214 Threat of Critical Race Theory215 President Trump recently issued an executive order prohibiting federal agencies from using critical race theory as part of their personnel-training programs. The president acted in response to my reporting exposing the use of diversity, equity, and inclusion training courses in federal agencies. These programs, based on a neo-Marxist ideology that originated in law schools a generation ago, purport to expose and correct unconscious racial bias and white privilege among their employees. Critical race theory treats whiteness as a moral blight and maligns all members of that racial group as complicit in oppression. Critical race theory now forms the basis of personnel-training programs around the country, from corporate America and universities to churches and nonprofits. One can trace a direct line from the critical race theory trainings in government, education, and universities to the recent violence and destruction in the streets of so many American cities. Many committed to the cultural Marxist narrative are now entrenched in vital American institutions. The recent riots have exposed the extent to which leaders in the Democratic Party have embraced the ideology of the woke Left. With such widespread penetration of that ideology, the crisis is unlikely to fade away. The riots of the last three months could open the door to a radical transformation of our constitutional system, including an end to colorblind application of the rule of law-especially if the political coalition that has permitted, and even encouraged, violent protesters regains power at the national level. If leftists merely accuse others of racism, without these accusations being subject to scrutiny from conservative political leaders, they will retain their political momentum-and millions of Americans will continue to face the threat of accusation and cancellation. Whether it comes to racism or any other sin, few Americans believe that all members of any group are inherently innocent while all those of another are inherently guilty. Adherents of critical race theory do believe this, though-and theyre aggressively teaching it. Our leaders must expose critical race theory as the destructive ideology that it is.216 Top Trump Aide Hope Hicks Tests Positive for COVID-19 After Traveling With the President Tuesday and Wednesday217 Update President Trump tweeted that he and the first lady will quarantine until they get their test results back Hope Hicks, one of President Trumps closest aides, has tested positive for COVID-19 after traveling with the president aboard Air Force One to the presidential debate on Tuesday as well as the Trump rally in Minnesota on Wednesday.218 Trump Testing Positive for Coronavirus Could Actually Help His Chances of Re-Election219 Despite the media consensus that President Trump testing positive for coronavirus is a huge negative for his presidential campaign, data shows it could actually help him. Leftists reacted to the news that Trump and the First Lady had contracted COVID-19 with a mixture of gloating and glee, suggesting it was payback for the president not taking the virus seriously enough while also partly derailing his re-election campaign. However, if what happened after two other populist world leaders were infected with COVID repeats for a third time, it could actually boost Trumps poll numbers.220 Trump to Biden on Antifa Ideas Dont Burn Down Buildings221 During a Campaign rally in Duluth, Minnesota Wednesday, President Trump mocked Joe Bidens declaration during the Presidential debate that Antifa is just an idea. Joe Biden says Antifa is just an idea, Trump announced, adding Well, ideas dont assault cops and they dont burn down buildings. Antifa is a domestic terrorist organization.222 UK Plans Massive COVID Testing amp38 Digital Passport Regime223 Operation Moonshot is the name of the UK governments newly proposed COVID-19 mass testing scheme. The plan, revealed by The BMJ,1 involves an expansion of testing from the current hundreds of thousands of tests each day to 10 million a day by early 2021. But how does the government propose to do this? How will testing increase between now and early 2021? The documents show a proposed three-stage rollout. They state that the UK will carry out between 200,000 to 800,000 tests a day between September and December 2020. This might break down to 200,000 tests a day on people with symptoms, 100,000 a day on people without symptoms in local areas to suppress outbreaks, 250,000 a day on people without symptoms in the NHS and care homes, and 100,000 a day through national prevalence studies. From December the plans propose increasing daily capacity to between two and four million. This would involve mass testing of all homes in local areas or whole cities when prevalence rises 430,000 tests a day, testing high contact professions such as teachers every week 100,000 a day, and testing people to allow them to enter high risk settings, such as visitors to the hospital and care homes. The plan then states that there would be full rollout in early 2021 to 10 million tests a day, to enable people to return to and maintain a normal life. At this stage, weekly testing would be made available progressively to the whole population to allow people to go to high-risk events by using a digital passport to show they have tested negative for the virus. Comment There is no test for COVID-19, the test only shows that you may have had one of the family of corona virus in the past  so, a common cold would give a positive reading. Authorities know this  they are ramping up testing to generate massive numbers of positives which are really just false positives. This provides the pretext for Orwells boot stamping on the face forever.224 USB-C Was Supposed to Simplify Our Lives. Instead, Its a Total Mess.225 A mix of hidden standards make the ubiquitous cable a pain to deal with Techies hailed USB-C as the future of cables when it hit the mainstream market with Apples single-port MacBook in 2015. It was a huge improvement over the previous generation of USB, allowing for many different types of functionality  charging, connecting to an external display, etc.  in one simple cord, all without having a right side up like its predecessor. Five years later, USB-C is near-ubiquitous Almost every modern laptop and smartphone has at least one USB-C port, with the exception of the iPhone, which still uses Apples proprietary Lightning port. For all its improvements, USB-C has become a mess of tangled standards  a nightmare for consumers to navigate despite the initial promise of simplicity. Anyone going all-in on USB-C will run into problems with an optional standard called Power Delivery. The standard allows devices to charge at a much higher wattage relative to older connectors, therefore allowing them to charge faster. But it requires the right combination of charger, cables, and device to actually achieve this.226 Video Democratic Ad Compares 2020 America to Nazi Germany227 The Jewish Democratic Council of America is facing backlash after it produced a campaign ad that compared America under President Trump to Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler. The video, titled Hate doesnt stop itself, it must be stopped, features a split screen with footage of Trump rallies, and by its side footage of nazi rallies from the 1930s. For good measure, the Democrats threw in images of white supremacists from Charlottesville in 2017, as well as images from the 2018 Pittsburgh synagogue attack.228 Washington Post Tweets Imagine What it Will be Like Never to Have to Think About Trump Again After Coronavirus Announcement229 Despite being apparently unconnected to Trumps announcement that he had contracted coronavirus, the Washington Post was forced to delete a tweet that stated, Opinion Imagine what it will be like to never have to think about Trump again. Trump tweeted that he and Melania had tested positive for COVID-19 last night, prompting a wave of gloating and celebration from leftists and the media. 39 minutes later, the Washington Post tweeted a link to the story, with many believing it to be a reaction to the news.230 Watch BLM Chastises Hotel Guests for Closing Blinds During Vigil for Man Who Pointed Gun at Police231 Black Lives Matter BLM activists chastised hotel guests in downtown Portland on Wednesday night for closing their blinds during a vigil for a black man who was shot by police two years ago  A grand jury determined that the officers involved in the fatal incident were justified in their use of deadly force. It is incredibly disrespectful for all of you to be up here. And you are so privileged. There is a memorial for a man who was killed and you think its more important to watch TV, a protester said. That is their priority. So get your priorities straight. This isnt a joke.232 Woman Charged With Using Minors to Steal Trump, Stefanik Campaign Signs233 AMSTERDAM, NY WRGB The Montgomery County Sheriffs Office say they have arrested a Schenectady woman, accused of using minors to steal campaign signs.

The defense responded the rape as a youthful sin in response.236 Corbyn, The PMs Dad, And a Scottish Separatist A Week of High-Profile COVID Rule Breaking237 Margaret Ferrier MP has admitted to travelling back and forth from Scotland to London despite awaiting a coronavirus diagnosis that later proved positive. Ferrier, a member of the leftist, separatist Scottish National Party SNP, had said she had taken a COVID-19 test on Saturday after experiencing mild symptoms, but made the journey south on Monday because she said she was feeling much better. Potentially risking infection to other MPs in Parliament, she then entered the chamber and used her time to praise the NHS for its handling of the pandemic, according to the Metro. It was after her appearance in the House of Commons that evening she received the news she had coronavirus. Rather than self-isolating at her London home as legally mandated, she took the train back to Scotland on Tuesday morning, failing to inform the Speaker of the House of Commons until Wednesday afternoon. The MP apologised for her actions, and the SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford announced on Thursday that he would be suspending the whip for Ferrier, effectively suspending her from the party. On Friday, party leader Nicola Sturgeon called for Ferrier to do the right thing and resign as MP.238 Czechia to Reintroduce a State of Emergency on Monday239 On Monday, Oct. 5, the Czech Republic will declare a state of emergency once again after the government approved the proposal of the Minister of Health Roman Prymula, who suggested to make this move to stop the rapid spread of coronavirus.

Its a scam. A swindle. Its high time we understood that were in the midst of a global crime. This large group of medical experts publishes a medical newspaper on 500,000 copies every week, to inform the public about the massive misinformation in the mainstream media. They also organize mass protests in Europe, like the one on August 29, 2020 where 12 million people signed up and several millions actually showed up. Why do these 500 medical doctors say the pandemic is a global crime? What do they know, that we dont?248 Most Czechs Would Refuse COVID-19 Vaccine, Do Not Trust Vaccines in General249 Most Czechs would refuse to be vaccinated against COVID-19 when the vaccine is available, according to the survey by the STEM  MARK agency, with respondents mostly explaining their reluctance by saying that they generally did not trust any vaccination.

Vaccines against a new type of coronavirus are currently being developed and tested in several countries, including the Czech Republic. Russian researchers have also introduced the first officially completed vaccine named Sputnik. So far, Czechia has a prototype of its own vaccine, which will now be assessed by experts from the Czech Vaccinological Society.

Hungary is at the same time suspending all bilateral political contacts with her. According to Orban, Jourovas recent statements are incompatible with her current mandate. In the letter, Orban claimed that Jourova said that in Hungary a sick democracy is being built, a political attack against the democratically elected Government of Hungary and a humiliation to Hungary and the Hungarian people. Moreover, Orban recalled that the Commissions role is neutral and Jourovas wording are a blatant violation of the principle of sincere cooperation.252 Poland Hears Echoes of Nazi Rhetoric After German Politician Urges EU to Starve Poland and Hungary253 Deputy Head of the European Parliament, Katarina Barley, has caused massive outrage due to her appeal to starve Poland and Hungary of EU funds. According to the website of radio Deutschlandfunk, Barley called for increased pressure against Poland and Hungary to maintain so-called rule of law in those countries.

Falk Similarities between Germanys left and the right-wing AfD may seem hard to find, however when it comes to Russia and President Putin, both appear to possess shared ideas and sentiments. Are the AfD and the Left Really Polar Opposites? Germanys right-wing party Alternative für Deutschland AfD and The Left are easy to distinguish in daily politics. Both sides make sure of it by slandering one another on an almost daily basis by calling each other Nazis and Communists. And those are just the friendlier exchanges. The recent assassination attempt on Aleksej Navalny, however, once again displayed how the contours of German politics are blurred when Russia is involved. The latest example of this was provided by the AfDs foreign policy spokesman Hansjörg Müller. Asked about the Navalny case and Russias involvement he stated that the US could have committed the crime because of Nord Stream 2. 262 UK Softens Negotiating Stance, Offers EU Three-Year Fishing Transition Period Report263 The United Kingdom has reportedly softened its position on one of its Brexit red lines, by offering the European Union a three-year transition period for European fishermen to access British fishing waters.

His wife Anne stood behind the tow-truck so it couldnt reverse and escape.272 UK The NHS Needs to Stop Being Hysterical. Taking Steps to Shield the Vulnerable Elderly From COVID is Not Age-Based Apartheid273 There are practical ways to protect the vulnerable elderly without going as far as age-based apartheid. For example, special efforts have been made to ensure older people can get shopping delivered rather than having to go out themselves. Older people themselves are now much more aware of the risks than before, but at least have choices now about how much risk they are willing to accept. Those choices should not be taken away from them. That seems to be the opposite of current government policy  to impose sweeping restrictions on everyone and isolate the most vulnerable, whatever their personal wishes. So area after area of the UK is now under specific local restrictions. Scotland now bans members of one household entering another home. In the north-east of England, the rules will go even further this week, banning households from meeting each other in any enclosed space and strongly advising against mixing outdoors. Its getting to the point where talk of local lockdowns is becoming meaningless, since so many areas now face restrictions that they are, in effect, national restrictions. There seems to be a misguided sense of fairness going on. Rather than be seen to discriminate against older people  which is what the virus itself does  the medical establishment seems to want to make everyone suffer equally. So we end up with the farce of university students being forcibly confined to their halls of residence and told not to go home to their families, despite the fact that the illness poses little risk of serious illness to them.274 UK Watch Prince Harry and Meghan Speaks to London Newspaper on Race Awakening, Black History Month275 LONDON AP  Prince Harry has spoken about his awakening to race issues as he and his wife, Meghan, launched an anti-racism campaign to mark Black History Month in the U.K. In a video interview with the Evening Standard newspaper published Thursday, Harry said London sometimes doesnt feel as diverse as it actually is and that he wanted to use his celebrity to raise awareness about the Black community and the challenges it faces.276 Vatican Chief Denounces Intolerance of the Politically Correct277 ROME  The Vaticans Secretary of State decried the intolerance of political correctness Wednesday as an insidious attack on religious freedom present in many Western democracies.

The list of 40 officials who are responsible for election manipulation and the violent suppression of protests in Belarus, was ready in the middle of September, however, Lukashenkos name is missing from the list. Those sanctions should be imposed on him, especially, as he is the one who is the cause of violence in Belarus, Babis said before the meeting of the EU representatives.282 Report Dozens of Greeks Travel to Caucasus in Defense of Armenia283 The Greek City Times GCT reported on Thursday that roughly 80 volunteers from Greece are traveling to Armenia to support the country against Turkey and Azerbaijan in the contested Nagorno-Karabakh region.

The populations trust in the rule of law has declined. There are areas where people feel unsafe, and there are corners in Berlin, for example in Neukölln and Kreuzberg, where even police officers only move in groups because they are exposed to attacks, Knispel said. Knispel, chairman of the Association of Berlin Public Prosecutors, has for a long time been warning politicians for ignoring the growth of migrant clans.310 Germany is Failing to Fight Child Marriages in Migrant Communities311 Although Germany has a law to protect minors from forced marriages, it does not apply in practice, and the number of child marriages in Germany is rapidly rising, with 98 percent of those affected with a migration background.

Their presence had attracted the attention of the Italian coastguard, which set to sea to investigate and found three boats pretending to fish in Italian waters.316 Largest Texas County Adds Noncitizens to Voter Rolls317 Harris County, which includes Houston, had more than four million people in the last census318 Lawyer Linked to Swedish Migrant Clan Gangs Threatened With Expulsion From Bar Association319 Gothenburg lawyer Edip Samuelsson, who has represented local migrant clan gangs, has been threatened with expulsion from the Bar Association after allegedly leaking restricted information from detainees. Samuelsson, who has represented members of Gothenburgs notorious Ali Khan clan in several cases, was fined 50,000 Swedish kronor 4,3245,580 and given a warning after being found to have violated legal practice rules for leaking information.320 Salvini Looks to Head Off Migrant Trial, Seeks Political Gain321 CATANIA, Italy Reuters  Italys far-right leader Matteo Salvini goes to court on Saturday to try to persuade a judge not to charge him with illegally detaining migrants at sea  a crime that carries a maximum 15-year prison term. The high profile case centres on an incident in July 2019, when Salvini, the then interior minister, blocked more than 100 migrants aboard a coastguard sharp for six days as he waited for European allies to agree to take them in. Salvini has looked to leverage maximum political gain from the legal battle, saying he had been acting in the national interest by slowing the flow of undocumented migrants.322 The DOJ Forced a New Jersey Town to Accept a Mosque, A Chinese Immigrant Familys Son Joined Hamas323 When federal investigators showed up at the Xie family home in Basking Ridge, there was a courtesy Porsche loaner in the driveway. The pleasant New Jersey community has become the place where successful Chinese immigrants move after theyve outgrown places like Fort Lee. Like the earlier generation of Jewish residents, they came for the schools and suburban living. The neighbors of the Xie family on the tree-lined street are mostly Jewish and Asian upper middle class professionals employed by Fortune 500 companies and living the American dream. The Xie home with its soaring gables, its two car garage, and the Porsche out front, signaled that they had made it. And with access to good schools, their children would outdo them. Jonathan Xie probably never will. His guilty plea to one count of concealing attempts to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization puts an end to the case against him, and likely to the future his parents might have planned for him a degree from an Ivy League college, a prestigious profession, and another big house like theirs in a leafy suburb. Two years after Jonathan graduated from high school, federal investigators were going through the familiar and humiliating process of carting boxes past the loaner Porsche and the two car garage. Something had gone very wrong. Like a surprisingly diverse number of American teens, Jonathan had decided to convert to Islam, become an Islamic terrorist and kill lots of people. Especially Jews. And possibly anyone in Trump Tower. Including President Trump324 UK Considering Floating Asylum Centres in Old Ferries, Sending Migrants to Remote Islands Reports325 The British government is said to be considering off-shore asylum centres on old ferries, or even sending claimants to remote islands in the South Atlantic. The government is reportedly considering turning retired ferries into floating asylum centres off of the British coast to hold would-be refugees until their claims are assessed, according to documents seen by The Times.326 UK More Than 9,000 Asylum Seekers Are Now Living in 91 Hotels Across the Country Amid Record Number of Channel Crossings327 More than 9,000 asylum seekers are living in 91 hotels across the country after a record year for Channel crossings, MPs have been told. Home Office officials told the Public Accounts Committee 9,500 people have been put up in almost a hundred hotels in around 50 local authority areas. And the departments permanent secretary Matthew Rycroft told the committee There are more people coming into the aylum system at the moment than are leaving it and that is because of Covid.328 UN Insists Record Boat Migrant Numbers Not a Threat To Britain329 Record numbers of illegal immigrants crossing the English Channel are not a threat to Britain, and could even be a boon for taxpayers, the United Nations UN has claimed. Speaking to the Commons Home Affairs Committee on Wednesday, representatives from the international body argued that Britain should open new channels that would allow many more low and no-skilled third world migrants to enter the country legally in order to deter individuals from paying people traffickers.330 Athletics Great Jane Flemming Says Transgender Athletes Shouldnt be Allowed to Compete in Womens Sport as Their Physical Advantages Make Them a Danger to Female Competitors331 Jane Flemming, who competed in three Commonwealth and two Olympic games during the late 1980s and early 1990s, said transgender athletes were a safety risk to female competitors.332 Satanic Temple Sues Advertising Company for Refusing to Put Up Billboards Claiming Abortion is a Ritual333 The Satanic Temple is suing an advertising company after it refused to display billboards that said abortion is a ritual.

The creed and ethos were both recently changed to be gender-neutral, removing words like men and man in favor of warrior and SEALS.336 UK Teachers Banned From Encouraging Children to Change Their Gender According to New Breakthrough Guidelines337 New British legislation is being hailed as a breakthrough that discourages teachers from suggesting that children should change their gender based on what they choose to wear or personality traits. The new British guidelines concern interpersonal, sexual and sexual health education in primary and secondary schools, and come at a time when gender transition surgeries are surging in the United Kingdom. Transsexuality is only one of the many topics mentioned, but it already suggests a significant change in the approach of the British government to the issue, according to Polish outlet Niezalezna.338  1  2 422283  3 422086  4 422195  5 422225  6 422138  7 422116  8 422146  9 422130  10 422231  11 422122  12 422142  13 422084  14 422181  15 422171  16 422165  17 422209  18 422152  19 422120  20 422305  21 422303  22 422297  23 422187  24 422193  25 422106  26 422191  27 422132  28 422229  29 422215  30 422140  31 422207  32 422163  33 422177  34 422205  35 422175  36 422159  37 422221  38 422148  39 422213  40 422233  41 422183  42 422156  43 422301  44 422211  45 422203  46 422124  47 422299  48 422199  49 422197  50 422179  51 422118  52 422110  53 422223  54 422161  55 422189  56 422136  57 422114  58 422169  59 422173  60 422150  61 422201  62 422239  63 422263  64 422243  65 422269  66 422261  67 422088  68 422108  69 422249  70 422087  71 422241  72 422102  73 422253  74 422104  75 422089  76 422271  77 422273  78 422267  79 422281  80 422154  81 422112  82 422279  83 422275  84 422128  85 422235  86 422277  87 422144  88 422185  89 422167  90 422227  91 422091  92 422097  93 422093  94 422099  95 422289  96 422237  97 422293  98 422257  99 422251  100 422245  101 422287  102 422259  103 422126  104 422255  105 422295  106 422085  107 422265  108 422291  109 422285  110 422095  111 422217  112 422219  113 422247  114  115 topheadline  116  117 topheadline  118  119 topheadline  120  121 topheadline  122  123 topheadline  124  125 topheadline  126  127 topheadline  128  129 topheadline  130  131 topheadline  132  133 topheadline  134 rzerohedgefeed391-D7EVrCBocalifornia-gov-newsom-changes-reopening-rules-again-adds-racial-equity-measures  135 topheadline  136  137  138 topheadline  139  140 topheadline  141  142 topheadline  143  144 topheadline  145  146 topheadline  147  148 topheadline  149  150 topheadline  151  152 topheadline  153  154 topheadline  155  156 topheadline  157  158 topheadline  159  160 topheadline  161  162 topheadline  163  164 topheadline  165  166 topheadline  167  168 topheadline  169  170 topheadline  171  172 topheadline  173  174 topheadline  175  176 topheadline  177  178 topheadline  179  180 topheadline  181  182 topheadline  183  184 topheadline  185  186 topheadline  187  188 topheadline  189  190 topheadline  191  192 topheadline  193  194 topheadline  195  196 topheadline  197  198 topheadline  199  200 topheadline  201  202 topheadline  203  204 topheadline  205  206 topheadline  207  208 topheadline  209  210 topheadline  211  212 topheadline  213  214 topheadline  215  216 topheadline  217  218 topheadline  219  220 topheadline  221  222 topheadline  223  224 topheadline  225  226 topheadline  227  228 topheadline  229  230 topheadline  231  232 topheadline  233  234 topheadline  235  236 topheadline  237  238 topheadline  239  240 topheadline  241  242 topheadline  243  244 topheadline  245  246 topheadline  247  248 topheadline  249  250 topheadline  251  252 topheadline  253  254 topheadline  255 rblacklistednewshKxa3A3scfuQi3Z8covid-police-crash-10yearold-girls-birthday-party-after-neighbors-snitch-on.html  256 topheadline  257  258 topheadline  259 rblacklistednewshKxa3S1C8KumQxJsthe-hidden-epidemic-childabuse-underreported-during-uk.html  260 topheadline  261  262 topheadline  263  264 topheadline  265  266 topheadline  267  268 topheadline  269  270 topheadline  271  272 topheadline  273  274 topheadline  275  276 topheadline  277  278 topheadline  279  280 topheadline  281  282 topheadline  283  284 topheadline  285  286 topheadline  287  288 topheadline  289  290 topheadline  291  292 topheadline  293  294 topheadline  295  296 topheadline  297  298 topheadline  299  300 topheadline  301  302 topheadline  303  304 topheadline  305  306 topheadline  307  308 topheadline  309  310 topheadline  311  312 topheadline  313  314 topheadline  315  316 topheadline  317  318 topheadline  319  320 topheadline  321  322 topheadline  323  324 topheadline  325  326 topheadline  327  328 topheadline  329  330 topheadline  331  332 topheadline  333  334 topheadline  335  336 topheadline  337  338 topheadline","homeless, homelessness"

Glapinski underlined that Poland is leaving each crisis stronger, without losses or with barely any and as a result, each time we are lessening the gap towards the damaged leaders. We are overtaking more and more countries which are falling into disarray, such as Portugal, Greece and soon Spain. He added that in less than 10 years, Poland may overtake Italys powerful economy.85 Anyone Know Any Hackers? Anti-Racist Facebook Group Targets Parents Who Questioned Schools Critical Race Theory Curriculum86 A group of parents and teachers in Loudoun County, Virginia, are working to compile a list of parents in the county who are suspected of disagreeing with the school district adding Critical Race Theory to its curriculum. The 624-member private Facebook group called Anti-Racist Parents of Loudoun County issued a call to members to provide information about parents who they felt disagreed with school curriculum or were neutral on it.87 He Doesnt Know Anything  and Id Say it to His Face  Nobel Prize Winning Inventor of PCR Test Unloads on Dr. Fauci in Earlier Video88 Kary Mullis, who won a 1993 Nobel Prize for inventing the polymerase chain reaction PCR testing procedure that is currently used to diagnose Coronavirus cases unloaded on Dr. Anthony Fauci in a video that went viral over the weekend. In the resurfaced video Kary Mullis accused Fauci of not knowing anything really about anything but going on TV anyway and lying to the American public. Some things never change. The interview was originally recorded back during the AIDS crisis in 1993 when Dr. Fauci was spouting off to the cameras.89 As Left-Wing Anarchism Stalks His City, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler Warns of White Supremacy90 In responding to the ongoing left-wing violence in his city, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler raised eyebrows Monday by suggesting white supremacists share blame with the anarchists populating the streets.91 Atlanta Shootings Spa Shooting Victims Identified After Arrest92 Police in the US state of Georgia have identified four of the eight people who were killed in mass shootings at three massage parlours in the Atlanta area. Officials say it is still too early to know whether the attack, in which six Asian women were killed, was racially motivated. Cherokee County Sheriff Frank Reynolds said the suspect may have been a patron and claimed to have a sex addiction. The attack comes amid a sharp uptick in crimes against Asian-Americans. Four of the victims have been identified as Ashley Yaun, 33 Paul Andre Michels, 54 Xiaojie Yan, 49 and Daoyou Feng, 44. Elcias R Hernandez-Ortiz was identified as having been injured. In a news conference on Wednesday, investigators said suspect Robert Aaron Long admitted to the shooting spree, and said that he denied that the attack was motivated by race. He apparently has an issue, what he considers a sex addiction, and sees these locations as a temptation for him that he wanted to eliminate, said Capt Jay Baker, adding that Mr Long was caught with a 9mm handgun and did not resist arrest. Massage parlours are known to sometimes provide prostitution services, but authorities say there is no indication yet that this is the case at the targeted locations93 Biden Goes to War Against the American People as the Globalists Unleash Sinister and Deadly Measures in Their War Against Freedom and Liberty94 Offering America a glimpse of what life might be like in the country by this Summer, Biden declared that much of America re-opening depends upon Americans getting vaccinated in huge numbers I need you to get vaccinated when its your turn and you can find an opportunity Biden babbled. Also telling the public that IF the nation can reach its vaccination goals, it will be possible for Americans to gather in small groups to celebrate July 4, as we had also reported on March 12th after his speech to the nation and big pharma busting out their ex-presidents propaganda machine, Americans across the country were having nothing to do with Biden dictating what freedoms Americans can or cannot have. With talk by the left of mandatory injections of the Covid-19 kill shot in order for Americans to have certain rights, such as the right to travel or the right to go to the grocery store helping to show how an entire generation of young Americans is being indoctrinated to being treated like slaves, well be taking an extended look at Bidens recent speech and the hidden messages within it which show America is being herded towards disaster.95 Biden Says Masks Should be Worn Until Everyone is Vaccinated96 President Joe Biden has said that people should continue wearing face masks until everyone has been vaccinated. Taking questions at the White House about whether former President Trump should promote the vaccine to Republican skeptics, Biden argued it was more important what local doctors and preachers say about it.97 Breaking Dem Michigan AG Says She Wont Investigate Whitmers Nursing Home Policy, Claims it Would be a Political Attack98 Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a fellow Democrat, says she wont investigate Governor Whitmers nursing home policy despite controversy, claiming to do so would be a political attack. Nessel said her office cant investigate whether decisions made quickly to contain COVID-19 constituted bad public policy if other alternatives were available. She said the Attorney Generals Office is limited to investigating criminal allegations, but there are none with the nursing home policies.99 California Teachers Unions Discuss Using COVID-Relief Cash for Bonuses, Trips to Hawaii100 Throw billions of dollars at school districts in California, and what do you expect? A group called Reopen California Schools got access to online memos from teachers unions in California and discovered that in some districts, enriching their members weighs heavier on their priorities than, say, PPE equipment or programs to help children recover from their prolonged absence from the classrooms. Here is what the teachers union in Dublin, CA, a well-to-do suburb east of San Francisco is discussing101 California Restaurant Uses Generator to Stay Open After City Cuts Off Power for Violating COVID-19 Restrictions102 A restaurant in California is defying local coronavirus orders by using a generator after a Los Angeles County judge ruled that the city could cut off power to the restaurant for not following health orders. Tinhorn Flats Saloon amp38 Grill in Burbank, California, has said it plans to stay open despite coronavirus restrictions.103 Candace Owens Says She Will Sue Cardi B for Defamation104 Conservative personality Candace Owens said Tuesday that she would sue pop star Cardi B over slander involving a photoshopped tweet that the singer was promoting on Twitter. The two individuals have had public Twitter arguments before, with the most recent spat beginning after Owens appeared on the show of Fox Newss Tucker Carlson on Monday evening. Owens talked about her upcoming talk show through conservative media outlet The Daily Wire and criticized Cardi B for her sexually explicit performance at the 2021 Grammy awards.105 Capitol Investigation Seeks to Criminalize Political Dissent106 The governments response to the January 6 melee isnt about justice. Its about partisan retribution and revenge. And the consequences will be disastrous. Ginning Up Domestic Terrorism Worrells arrest is the latest in what the U.S. Department of Justice warned would be an unprecedented investigation leading to sedition charges filed against American citizens. Attorney General Merrick Garland pledged to make the Capitol Breach manhunt his top priority on his first day in office, he received an update on the investigation from FBI Director Christopher Wray. Garland has compared January 6 to the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people, including 15 children. Roughly 300 people have been arrested so far, many of them transported to Washington, D.C. to await trial and dozens denied bail after federal prosecutors argued the defendants, including a high school senior from Georgia, pose a threat to the nation. The Capitol Breach probe, the departments official title, is a flagrant political prosecution targeting Trump supporters. Every display-from heavy-handed FBI raids to a militarized Washington, D.C.-is designed to portray the President Trumps allies as domestic terrorists. The differences between how the government is handling the January 6 defendants and other so-called protestors could not be more stark. For example, a Portland investigative reporter found the Justice Department has dropped more than one-third of the federal cases related to last summers riots in that city, with more to come. Only about a dozen people have been arrested for last weeks rioting in Portland, which included attacks on a federal courthouse.107 Desantis Florida Will Exclude Critical Race Theory From Its Curriculum108 Florida Gov. Ron. DeSantis announced the Florida curriculum will not include critical race theory. DeSantis said Floridas civics curriculum will incorporate foundational concepts with the best materials and it will expressly exclude unsanctioned narratives like critical race theory and other unsubstantiated theories. Let me be clear, theres no room in our classrooms for things like critical race theory, teaching kids to hate their country and to hate each other is not worth one red cent of taxpayer money.109 Digital Anti-Hate Group Puts Dr. Mercola on Hit List110 Story at-a-glance One of the frontrunners in the comprehensive attack on freedom of speech online is a U.K.-based group with opaque funding called the Centre for Countering Digital Hate CCDH The CCDH has been one of the most vocal organizations calling for the deplatforming of anyone who might have the ability to influence public opinion about vaccines The CCDH recently posted a hit list on Twitter, listing the Top 10 anti-vaxxers it wants digital platforms to eradicate, including yours truly and the National Vaccine Information Center NVIC, which worked with the U.S. Congress to establish the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act in 1986 March 2, 2021, Facebook complied with CCDHs request, removing NVICs account. CCDH is also calling on Facebook to eliminate NVIC from Instagram, which Facebook owns While you wait for a decentralized, censorship-free internet, consider ditching all social media networks that erode our civil liberties, and to join those that promote freedom of speech instead111 Facebooks Popularity is Significantly Waning112 Facebook is considered the most dominant social media platform, with about 2.8 billion monthly active users globally. However, over the past few years, after mass privacy invasions and censorship practices, it has been losing its dominance in a few important demographics and all social media users in general. Research conducted by Edison Research revealed some unsurprising facts regarding Facebook. First, Facebook is no longer the preferred social media platform for people between the ages of 12 and 34 millennials and gen Z. Losing people in this demographic is bad news for Facebook as this is the demographic preferred by most advertisers. Only 21 of people aged 12 to 34 said their preferred social media platform is Facebook.113 Family Kicked Off Flight for Not Forcing 4-Year-Old Autistic Son to Wear Mask114 Spirit Airlines kicked a family off a flight home to Little Rock, Arkansas because they refused to force their four-year-old autistic son to wear a face mask. THV11 reports that the family even had a doctors note exempting their son owing to his condition, which is recognised under the American Disability Act.115 GoFundMe to Pay Off Meghan Markle and Prince Harrys Mortgage Goes Bust116 A GoFundMe page set up to pay off the mortgage on Meghan Markle and Prince Harrys 14.6 million California estate has gone bust  after raising a measly 110, a report says.117 Guns, Knives and Other Weapons Confiscated From Suspects at Portland Antifa Riot118 After dozens of armed Antifa militants smashed up an apartment building in downtown Portland on Friday night, police made 13 arrests. The masked suspects were found to be carrying guns, knives, crow bars, hammers and other weapons. At around 9 p.m., officers from the Portland Police Bureau rushed after the Antifa rioting in Portlands wealthy Pearl District and created a manned perimeter. So-called legal observers, reporters, and anyone with medical conditions were given the opportunity to leave the enclosed area after identifying themselves to law enforcement.119 Iowa West Liberty School District Cancels Classes Monday After 90 of Staff Got Sick After Moderna Shots120 A small town school district was forced to cancel all classes today after nearly all of its staff got sick after mRNA shots. All 120 staff members for the school district received their second Moderna mRNA shots this past Saturday. The district announced on Sunday that classes would be cancelled today due to lack of staff.121 Mainstream Media Losing Their Minds Over Florida122 Consider the following. Florida has a larger number of people over the age of 65 4.4 million compared to only 1.8 million in California. We know that the age group most likely to succumb to Covid are the senior set, i.e., 65 and up. You would expect more people would die in Florida given that dramatically larger number of senior citizens running around, especially given that Florida is open for business. But that did not happen. Total deaths in California as of this writing is 54,892 dead compared to Floridas 32,285. What separates Ron DeSantis from the Governors of New York, California, Michigan, New Jersey and Massachusetts is that our Governor protected the seniors inhabiting nursing homes and assisted living facilities. The Governors of those blue states allowed Covid infected people to be housed in senior facilities. Cuomo reportedly has the blood of more than 13,000 on his hands as a result of his insane policy.123 MIT amp38 Harvard Study Suggests mRNA Vaccine Might Permanently Alter DNA After All124 If our cells become permanent rather than temporary Spike Protein producing factories due to permanent alteration of our genomic DNA, this could lead to serious autoimmune problems Comment Recommended reading.125 Moderna Now Dosing Children as Young as Six Months Old With Experimental mRNA Vaccine as Part of Study126 Today, vaccine firm Moderna Inc. announced that they will be testing their new experimental mRNA vaccine on young children. The pharmaceutical firm claims that this new phase of human testing is merely to gauge the safety and effectiveness of their new COVID-19 vaccine. However, this is an unprecedented corporate practice  never before have Government regulators allowed an experimental technology to forego years of animal testing and human trials and careful follow-up studies all normally conducted before a new vaccine product is released into the general population. Moreover, Moderna will be taking otherwise perfectly healthy young children who are at zero risk of ever becoming ill from the COVID-19 disease and then exposing them to an experimental gene-based mRNA vaccine technology. According to the companys press release, the large scale vaccine experiment is the second phase of their Kid COVE Study is expected to enroll no less than 6,750 healthy children in the US and Canada ranging between six months and 11 years old.127 News Media Calls on Amazon to Censor More Books128 Under the guise of concern for the book readers ability to navigate available information about the coronavirus pandemic, more media pressure is mounting on Amazon, that controls a huge chunk of the online market  to start banning more books. And while Amazon is already, and very controversially from the point of view of free speech supporters, banning some books, other types of activists and their media outlets clearly think that should only be the beginning.129 Newsom Says Origin of Recall Effort Has Ties to Right-Wing Militia Groups, QAnon Conspiracy Theories, Three Percenters, Proud Boys Video130 Embattled California Governor Gavin Newsom D said right-wing groups like QAnon supporters and Proud Boys are behind efforts to boot him from office on Tuesday during an appearance on The View. Republicans launched a robust effort to recall Gavin Newsom and gathered more than 2 million of the 1.5 million signatures needed by the March 17 deadline.

It was in January of that year that they decided not to sue Google after conducting a probe, launched in 2011, into the giants monopolistic behavior. To make matters worse, the FTC of the time neither disclosed the details of its probe, nor explained the reasons behind the decision. Eight years later, Politico said it obtained 312 pages of FTCs confidential internal memos of the era, that the website says show people President Obama entrusted with recognizing the way the tech industry was going and proposing adequate action to protect competition and customers in many cases abjectly failed, as revealed in the documents.137 Portland Protest Arrests by the Numbers Through Feb 2021138 PORTLAND, Ore.

Joe Biden stood in front of the cameras Thursday night, March 11, and heaped lies upon lies, doing his best but failing miserably to make it sound like he actually cared about our health and wellbeing. His actions, along with his stone-cold black eyes, speak louder than his words. The U.S. government, under this mans leadership, has become the biggest human trafficker in the world. His policies in just 51 days have created a humanitarian crisis at the U.S. Mexican border that is devastating tens of thousands of lives. My sources inside the Department of Homeland Security tell me that upwards of 5,000 migrants a day are now crossing illegally into the United States. Most give themselves up to the border agents and repeat over and over the one word they have been trained to utter in English, asylum. At this rate, we are looking at 140,000 migrants per month flooding into American cities. That would add up to a staggering 1.7 million per year. We have evidence that the U.S. government is communicating with American leftist NGOs on the ground and working with the cartels leading the caravans on the other side of the border.

Now is the Time to Put a Stop to It148 It takes a long time for nations to fall, even when they are dead on their feet. A look back in history will show that in 1913 America took its fatal blow, and we are now seeing the results of that horrible year. Feb. 3, 1913 the 16th Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified, authorizing the federal government to impose income taxes on individuals. An amendment to a tariff act in 1894 had attempted to do this, but since it was clearly unconstitutional, the Supreme Court struck it down. As a result, and mostly under the banner of bleeding the rich, the 16th Amendment was promoted and passed. Woodrow Wilson signed it into law and in 1914 income taxes began. Then the other horrible acts of 1913. The 17th Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified, taking the powers of the states and transferring them to Washington, by mandating the popular election of senators. Previously, senators were appointed by state legislatures, restraining the power of the national government. This change gave political parties immediate and massive power, nearly all of which was consolidated in the city of Washington. Woodrow Wilson also signed the Federal Reserve Act, which had passed Congress just the previous day. This system called the Aldrich Plan, and promoted by Sen. Nelson Aldrich of Rhode Island gave a monopoly on the creation of dollars to a consortium of large banks. Here is why I say these three things is the blow that killed America. 1. They robbed every producer in America of their money and handed it to politicians. 2. They consolidated all power in Washington, D.C. 3. They created a money empire that took over almost everything.149 Young Florida Man Reaches Out for Help After His Parents Were Taken Away by FBI  Family Fears They Will Lose Their Farm and Desperately Need Help150 On Monday Zack Meggs reached out to The Gateway Pundit.

If someone on the left says the Great Replacement, that is us, the response is very good, but if someone on the right like Renuad Camus says there is a Great Replacement, they immediately cry fascism, Onfray said. The Great Replacement is a term coined by French author Renaud Camus in his 2010 book The Great Replacement, in which he proposes the theory that indigenous French people are being demographically replaced by non-European peoples at a time when France was the subject of repeated terrorist attacks by Islamists. That book is part of a larger wave of Euroepan cultural pessimism whose other proponents include Thilo Sarrazin in Germany, who wrote Germany Abolishes Itself, along with ric Zemmour The French Suicide and Michel Houllebecq Submission.159 Dutch Security Agency Says 1,200 Vulnerable Microsoft Servers Affected by Security Loophole as Data Stolen, Emails Sold Online160 Some 1,200 Microsoft email servers in the Netherlands are almost certainly infected, the countrys National Cyber ??Security Center NCSC said on Tuesday, as it urged companies to update their software and assess the damage.

Women do not belong in physical combat. Not because they are not competent, and there are many positions within the military that women are highly qualified for. On the ground combat is not one of them. Contrary to what folks on the left seem to believe, men and women are different, as men have thicker bone density and are generally physically stronger. Of course there are exceptions but as a general rule, men are more fit for combat than women. The proof is shown in recent reports which find that women in the military cannot keep up with the men in physical testing, so rather than acknowledge the differences between the two genders, the U.S. military is considering lowering the physical standards for women by rethinking about reversing their gender neutral physical testing. Research showed that the Army Combat Fitness Test ACFT, which is the same for male and female soldiers, was leading to lower results for women with a knock-on effect for promotions, The Telegraph reported. An early Pentagon study showed that women were failing the ACFT at a rate of 65 per cent, while only 10 percent of men did. So rather than say, okay, there are plenty of critical military jobs that women can and do perform without weakening the U.S. military by lowering the physical standards required for combat, the U.S. military under Joe Biden has decided weakening the testing standards, therefore weakening the military as a whole, is better becausechecks notesyes, DIVERSITY!!!!!241 Facebook Introduces New Censorship and Punishment Measures for Groups and Their Members242 Facebook has announced new rules surrounding groups, including putting members who repeatedly violate its policies on probation and limiting the reach of problematic groups. The rules are part of the platforms continued efforts to tackle misinformation and harmful content. The group feature on Facebook allows people with common interests to come together and discuss issues. However, left to their own devices, Facebook suggests that groups have become one of the greatest tools in spreading misinformation and so it wants to get involved in policing what people talk about.243 Meet Sports Illustrated Swimsuits First Ever Black and Asian Transgender Star Model Leyna Bloom Makes History in Stunning Beach Shoot as She Reveals How She Overcame Homelessness to Achieve Her Fashion Dream244 Sports Illustrated has revealed the first ever black and Asian transgender model to grace the pages of its annual Swimsuit Issue. Though the iconic magazine doesnt launch until July, the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue Instagram account has been unveiling one model a day throughout the month of March  and this morning, they made waves with the announcement that Chicago-born model, dancer, actor, and activist Leyna Bloom, 27, is joining the likes of Lais Ribeiro and Josephine Skriver in the 2021 edition. Leyna, who is the second trans model to pose for SI Swim, opened up to Good Morning America about her boundary-breaking accomplishment, gushing I never imagined that I would be born in a time when something like this would happen for someone with my skin tone and for someone with my background.245 Polling Firm Characterizes Asking a Woman Out as a Form of Sexual Harassment246 As a debate over misogyny rages in the UK, polling firm YouGov recently released a survey that characterized asking a woman out for a drink as a form of sexual harassment. Yes, really. After the tragic abduction and murder of 33-year-old Sarah Everard in London, protesters demanded all manner of new measures, including a 6pm curfew for men. Others are now pushing for misogyny to be made a hate crime, as if murderers would have second thoughts about abducting and killing a woman because of a law that primarily targets speech. Absolutely none of these professional activists demanded that the law be changed so women who carry pepper spray arent hit with the same legal penalty as they would be for carrying a gun, which is currently the law in the UK.247 Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam Signs Law to Expand Abortion Coverage Without Limits248 Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam signed a law on Friday that requires state taxpayers to fund abortion in any circumstance. The law ends a ban on abortion coverage for insurance plans. The ban was originally enacted by former Republican Gov. Robert McDonnell in 2011 and allowed the Affordable Care Act to only cover abortions in cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother.249  1 446594  2 446578  3 446493  4 446566  5 446658  6 446497  7 446576  8 446511  9 446503  10 446568  11 446570  12 446501  13 446656  14 446529  15 446634  16 446556  17 446507  18 446652  19 446527  20 446513  21 446521  22 446519  23 446632  24 446509  25 446572  26 446610  27 446630  28 446540  29 446626  30 446654  31 446499  32 446491  33 446505  34 446515  35 446614  36 446564  37 446586  38 446584  39 446525  40 446580  41 446487  42 446588  43 446536  44 446560  45 446562  46 446582  47 446538  48 446640  49 446590  50 446648  51 446546  52 446554  53 446650  54 446638  55 446517  56 446602  57 446598  58 446542  59 446600  60 446604  61 446628  62 446523  63 446606  64 446608  65 446636  66 446533  67 446622  68 446620  69 446484  70 446489  71 446558  72 446548  73 446642  74 446612  75 446592  76 446644  77 446552  78 446646  79 446495  80 446616  81 446544  82 446550  83 446574  84  85 topheadline  86  87 topheadline  88  89 topheadline  90  91 topheadline  92  93 topheadline  94  95 topheadline  96  97 topheadline  98  99 topheadline  100  101 topheadline  102  103 topheadline  104  105 topheadline  106  107 topheadline  108  109 topheadline  110  111 topheadline  112  113 topheadline  114  115 topheadline  116  117 topheadline  118  119 topheadline  120  121 topheadline  122  123 topheadline  124  125 topheadline  126  127 topheadline  128  129 topheadline  130  131 topheadline  132  133 topheadline  134  135 topheadline  136  137 topheadline  138  139 topheadline  140  141 topheadline  142  143 topheadline  144  145 topheadline  146  147 topheadline  148  149 topheadline  150  151 topheadline  152  153 topheadline  154  155 topheadline  156  157 topheadline  158  159 topheadline  160  161 topheadline  162  163 topheadline  164  165 topheadline  166  167 topheadline  168  169 topheadline  170  171 topheadline  172  173 topheadline  174  175 topheadline  176  177 topheadline  178  179 topheadline  180  181 topheadline  182  183 topheadline  184  185 topheadline  186  187 topheadline  188  189 topheadline  190  191 topheadline  192  193 topheadline  194  195 topheadline  196  197 topheadline  198  199 topheadline  200  201 topheadline  202  203 topheadline  204  205 topheadline  206  207 topheadline  208  209 topheadline  210  211 topheadline  212  213 topheadline  214  215 topheadline  216  217 topheadline  218  219 topheadline  220  221 topheadline  222  223 topheadline  224  225 topheadline  226  227 topheadline  228  229 topheadline  230  231 topheadline  232  233 topheadline  234  235 topheadline  236  237 topheadline  238  239 topheadline  240  241 topheadline  242  243 topheadline  244  245 topheadline  246  247 topheadline  248  249 topheadline","homeless, homelessness"

If it makes you wonder why Gates, who isnt an elected official, would have anything to do with the stimulus, youre probably not alone. But he is, and he told Andy Serwer of Yahoo Finances All Market Summit virtual event that he is working to get billions of dollars added into the stimulus package to give to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. If hes successful, that money would not go to struggling Americans but, rather, outside of America for vaccines in developing countries. Gates admitted that he wants billions for Gavi, evidently beyond the 1.6 billion that the current administration has already pledged to Gavi for the fiscal years 2020-2023.85 U.S. GDP for Q3 Increased at 33.1 Annualized Rate, Beating Expectations86 U.S. gross domestic product increased at an annualized rate of 33.1 in the third quarter of 2020, surpassing the 32 estimate produced by a Dow Jones survey of economists. The economic boom was a record for the U.S. in the post World War II era. Previously, the record was 16.7 growth in the first quarter of 1950.87 14 DC Police Officers Injured During Wednesday Riots  One Lost Eyesight88 Rioters in Washington, D.C., injured 14 police officers in the chaos that ensued during the citys second night of protests over the death of Karon Hylton. The injuries include one officer losing eyesight after being targeted with a laser. DC Metropolitan Police Chief Peter Newsham told reporters on Thursday that 14 of his officers sustained injuries during overnight protests, according to a tweet from Associated Press reporter Mike Balsamo. The injures included eight officers being struck by incendiary devices, one eye injury from a laser, four struck by rocks or bricks, and one sprained ankle, the chief stated.89 79 of Americans Think the News Media is Politically Biased90 A survey published by the Pew Research Center, from data collected earlier in the year, shows that Americans have little faith that they are receiving fair and balanced reporting from their media outlets. The poll, conducted in February and March, shows that as many as 79 percent of Americans think news organizations are biased toward one side in the political and ideological schism. This is an increase of 7 percentage points compared to just a year before.91 After Peddling Trump-Russia Hit-Pieces Before 2016 Election  MSM Totally Ignores Bobulinski Bombshells on Bidens92 The mainstream media is silent following an explosive Tuesday night interview with Tony Bobulinski, a former Naval veteran of 20 years who provided text, email, and anecdotal evidence that he was brought in by the Biden family to manage a venture with a CCP-linked Chinese entity, and that they concealed Joe Bidens involvement.93 AIER Hosts Top Epidemiologists, Authors of the Great Barrington Declaration94 From October 1-4, 2020, the American Institute for Economic Research hosted a remarkable meeting of top epidemiologists, economists, and journalists, to discuss the global emergency created by the unprecedented use of state compulsion in the management of the Covid-19 pandemic. The result is The Great Barrington Declaration, which urges a Focused Protection strategy. After a brief explanation of the strategy, and a discussion of the astonishing costs of lockdown, the Declaration concludes Schools and universities should be open for in-person teaching. Extracurricular activities, such as sports, should be resumed. Young low-risk adults should work normally, rather than from home. Restaurants and other businesses should open. Arts, music, sport and other cultural activities should resume. The primary authors and signers of the document are Dr. Martin Kulldorff, Professor, Medicine, Harvard Medical School. Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, Professor, Medicine, Stanford University. Dr. Sunetra Gupta, Professor, Theoretical Epidemiology, University of Oxford.The co-signers include95 Anonymous Never Trumper Miles Taylor Now Works for Google96 Miles Taylor, the anti-Trump staffer who published an anonymous op-ed for the New York Times in 2018 declaring himself a part of the deep state resistance against the President before serving as chief of staff to former DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, went to work for Google after leaving the government.97 Anti-American Orders Project Is Encouraging Military to Stand Down to Leftist Terrorists After the Election98 This is another aspect of the color revolution coup against Trump. An organization of attorneys, calling themselves The Orders Project, is effectively encouraging military personnel to refuse orders to keep peace in the streets following the election if left-wing ANTIFA and Black Lives Matter terrorists lay waste to cities. Washington D.C. National Guard Major Adam DeMarco, a Democrat operative who ran unsuccessfully for U.S. Senate in Maryland in 2018, is exploiting his military bona fides to push his left-wing partisan agenda against President Trump with the help of the fake news media. He is complaining that the National Guard did too much to prevent rioting terrorists from spreading their orgy of destruction following the death of crackhead serial felon George Floyd in Minneapolis. DeMarco is a posterchild for The Orders Project, a left-wing lawfare group that is attempting to convince U.S. troops to stand down and allow the country to be decimated by anarchists who want President Trump removed from office following the election.99 BLM Mob Violently Chases Jewish Men Showing Solidarity At Philadelphia Protest100 Jewish men who said they were trying to show solidarity with Black Lives Matter protesters were violently chased away by the mob and ridiculed as being part of the synagogue of Satan, according to disturbing video posted online. The minute-long clip circulating on social media shows three men standing in the street during the protests sparked by the deadly police shooting of troubled local black man Walter Wallace.101 College Undergrads America is Racist, Looting Justified,  Reparations Required102 Americas next generation of college students, markedly liberal and who support Joe Biden nearly 3-to-1 over President Trump, have strongly adopted the positions of the Black Lives Matter movement, according to a sweeping new survey conducted for Yale Universitys William F. Buckley Program.103 Damning Hunter Biden Documents Mysteriously Vanish in Transit to Los Angeles, Tucker Says104 An employee at a sorting facility noticed that the package had been opened and arrived empty. There is always a lot going on that we dont have time to get to on the air, the Tucker Carlson Tonight host told his audience, but there is something specific going on behind the screens that we did feel like we should tell you about. On Monday of this week, we received from a source a collection of confidential documents related to the Biden family, Carlson went on. We believe they are authentic, theyre real and theyre damning. Carlson added he was contacted by the source while in Los Angeles preparing to interview Tony Bobulinski, a former business associate of Hunter Biden, who detailed Joes purported knowledge of his sons foreign dealings on the Fox News show Tuesday night. We texted a producer in New York and asked him to send those documents to us in L.A,  Carlson explained. And he did that, so Monday afternoon of this week, he shipped the documents overnight to California with a large national carrier, a brand-name company that weve used, youve used, countless times with never a single problem. But the documents never arrived in Los Angeles, Carlson said. Tuesday morning we received word from the shipping company that our package had been opened and the contents were missing. The documents had disappeared.105 Disney Considers Suing Newsom as California Governor Doubles Down on Closures106 When California public health officials announced guidelines for reopening theme parks that essentially guarantee that parks in Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego counties wont be able to open until perhaps mid-2021, heads of the respective theme parks rightfully blasted Gavin Newsom, citing their successes in reopening in other states and countries and alleging that his guidelines have no scientific basis. The next day, the Executive Director of the California Attractions and Parks Association, of which Disney is a member, said that a lawsuit was under consideration and all options are open at this point. By Thursday, sources within the industry and within Disney, speaking on condition of anonymity, stated that one option Disney was looking into was was moving as many jobs as possible out of California. Obviously the company cant pick Disneyland up and move, but the company has a massive footprint in California, both in Los Angeles and Orange counties. WDW Pro alluded to that potential in a Thursday evening blog post.107 Facebook Bans Veteran-Owned Political Merchandise Store108 Facebook is being accused of deliberately targeting a US veteran-owned business that has a page on the platform because the merchandise they sell features images of President Donald Trump, even though they sell merchandise around politicians on both sides of the aisle. The apparel company, American AF, had 1.6 million followers when it was permanently banned earlier this month.109 Fox News Host Tucker Carlsons Hunter Biden Documents Reportedly Located110 A package containing documents relating to Democratic presidential nominee Joe Bidens scandal-plagued son Hunter Biden that went missing while being shipped to Fox News host Tucker Carlson in California has been located, according to a report. The package was first brought up on Wednesday evening by Carlson on his program Tucker Carlson Tonight. Carlson said a source had sent his team a collection of confidential documents related to the Biden family that he believed to be authentic and damning.111 Girl Scouts Delete Justice Amy Coney Barrett Tweet After Severe Backlash and Boycott Threats112 The Girl Scouts stepped out of line when they posted messages on Twitter and Facebook congratulating Judge Amy Barrett on her new job as a member of the US Supreme Court. The backlash against the message was so strong and vicious that they deleted the post.113 Glenn Greenwald Quits the Intercept Over Censorship Of Hunter Biden Article114 Prominent journalist Glenn Greenwald on Thursday resigned from The Intercept, a news organization he co-founded, after editors sought to censor an article he wrote about The Posts expos on documents retrieved from a Hunter Biden laptop. Greenwald is best known for his 2013 reporting on leaked mass-surveillance documents from former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. His work for The Guardian won the Pulitzer Prize. The Intercepts editors, in violation of my contractual right of editorial freedom, censored an article I wrote this week, refusing to publish it unless I remove all sections critical of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, Greenwald wrote in a blog post. The brute censorship this week of my article  about the Hunter Biden materials and Joe Bidens conduct regarding Ukraine and China, as well my critique of the medias rank-closing attempt, in a deeply unholy union with Silicon Valley and the intelligence community, to suppress its revelations  eroded the last justification I could cling to for staying.115 Gov. Cuomo Criticism of New York Nursing Home Deaths a Conspiracy116 Governor Andrew Cuomo D-NY said Thursday on ABCs The View that New York States more than 6,000 nursing home deaths allegedly caused by his order to put patients infected with coronavirus back in facilities was a conspiracy theory. Comment Cuomo should be indicted on multiple murder charges. Note how Cuomo thinks he can pin this on Trump. 117 Gun Violence, Fatalities Reach 10-Year High in Rochester118 Rochester WHAM  Ten months into the year, 31 people have been shot and killed in the City of Rochester, the highest number of gun-related deaths since at least 2010. In total, 275 people have been victims of gun violence this year  also a record since at least 2010, which is when information on the Rochester Open Data Portal dates back to.119 Iannarones Tweet of Violent Despots Stirs Portland Mayors Race120 PORTLAND, Ore. KOIN  Just a week before the 2020 election, Portlands mayoral race is scrutinizing a tweet from the 2016 primary campaign. Last Friday, Mayor Ted Wheelers campaign released a statement taking challenger Sarah Iannarone to task for writing in violent despots like Ho Chi Minh and Joseph Stalin on her 2016 ballot. The tweet, from May 1, 2016, also includes write-in votes for Mao Zedong, Che Guevara, Fidel Castro, Vladimir Lenin, plus others. Most are figures on the global stage responsible for the deaths of millions of people over multiple decades.121 Irresponsible State Leadership Caused Many COVID-19 Deaths122 Another major error that drove up the death toll was state leaderships decision to place infected patients into nursing homes, against federal guidelines.9 According to an analysis10,11 by the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, which included data reported by May 22, 2020, an average of 42 of all COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. had occurred in nursing homes, assisted living and other long-term care facilities. This is extraordinary, considering this group accounts for just 0.62 of the population. By and large, nursing homes are ill equipped to care for COVID-19 infected patients.12 While theyre set up to care for elderly patients  whether they are generally healthy or have chronic health problems  these facilities are rarely equipped to quarantine and care for people with highly infectious disease. Its logical to assume that comingling infected patients with noninfected ones in a nursing home would result in exaggerated death rates, as the elderly are far more prone to die from any infection, including the common cold. We also learned, early on, that the elderly were disproportionately vulnerable to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Yet ordering infected patients into nursing homes with the most vulnerable population of all is exactly what several Democrat governors decided to do, including New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo,13 Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and California Gov. Gavin Newsom. ProPublica published an investigation14 June 16, 2020, comparing a New York nursing home that followed Cuomos misguided order with one that refused, opting to follow the federal guidelines instead. The difference was stark. By June 18, the Diamond Hill nursing home  which followed Cuomos directive  had lost 18 residents to COVID-19, thanks to lack of isolation and inadequate infection control. Half the staff about 50 people and 58 patients were infected and fell ill. In comparison, Van Rensselaer Manor, a 320-bed nursing home located in the same county as Diamond Hill, which refused to follow the states directive and did not admit any patient suspected of having COVID-19, did not have a single COVID-19 death. A similar trend has been observed in other areas. Comment Wilful murder, not irresponsible leaders. Akin to the old days of tossing an infected body into the fort that was under seige.123 Joe Rogan Debunks Claims He Spread Anti-Vaxxer Conspiracy Theories124 Joe Rogan responded to criticism that he was spreading anti-covid vaccine conspiracy theories during his podcast with Alex Jones by posting a CBS News clip in which Bill Gates admitted that in one COVID vaccine trial, 80 of participants suffered side-effects. Following a failed outrage campaign to have Rogans podcast with Jones deplatformed altogether, critics then turned to the content itself, accusing Rogan of facilitating dangerous conspiracy theories about COVID-19 vaccines.125 Looking Back on 35 Years as an Amiga User126 I had owned the Mac for just one week when I went to a different local computer store, Chaney Computer in Newport News, Virginia, to purchase a 45 10-count box of 3.5-inch floppy disks. My mother waited in the car while I ran in. And there on the table I saw it. The Amiga  the first one I had ever encountered. It was sitting there, fired up and running an animation demo of some sort. All of the things that made me so excited about the system before flooded back to me right there. I bought the box of floppies, but they never made it into that Macintosh. Later that night at the dinner table, I started off a conversation I had been frenziedly honing in my mind all afternoon. And, I carried it off well, it seems my parents agreed to changing gears, and the next day my father returned the Macintosh to the Apple dealer and we went and put a deposit down on the 1,285 Amiga. Incidentally, It was always called the Amiga 1000, but no one really noticed until the Amiga 500 and 2000 landed in 1987.127 Michigan Gun Store Owner Sees Spike in Sales Following Protests, Says Customers Were Scared After Riots128 A Michigan gun store owner made her biggest sales in May after rioting in Grand Rapids the night after a George Floyd protest took place. Lisa Mayo is the owner of Flashpoint Firearms just a few miles north of Grand Rapids.129 Mindlessness Fuels Tyranny130 Its no surprise that Dr. Anthony Fauci, with a vested interest in perpetuating the current Covid-19 narrative, has called the Great Barrington Declaration nonsense and very dangerous. Just as angry and closed-minded are the social media reactions from some ordinary people. We will lose many lives, they warn, if we give credence to the Declaration. The fearful are sure only they, not the signers of the Declaration, care about the lives of others. As Don Boudreaux writes, Much of humanity today appears to perversely enjoy being duped into the irrational fear that any one of us, regardless of age or health, is at the mercy of a brutal beast categorically more lethal than is any other danger that weve ever confronted. Those reacting against the Declaration seem to be stuck in time, living in March 2020 when ignorance of the viruss virulence was peaking. There is so much more we now know about Covid-19, yet the fearful will not consider new information or alternative theories.131 NSA Remains Silent on Secret Backdoors in Popular Tech132 The National Security Agency NSA is refusing to reveal its new policies on the placing of back doors into commercial tech products. While the agency may argue these backdoors are valuable for national security, they present privacy concerns and are a risk to national security should foreign adversaries manage to exploit them. Edward Snowden, a former NSA employee, now labeled a traitor, revealed how the NSA enters into agreements with US-based technology companies to give them special access back doors to their products. These backdoors allow the NSA and other government agencies to access personal data without a warrant.133 Our COVID-19 Plan Would Minimize Mortality and Lockdown-Induced Collateral Damage134 The Focused Protection plan in the Great Barrington Declaration would minimize both COVID-19 mortality and lockdown-induced collateral damage on other health outcomes. In line with pre-2020 pandemic preparedness plans, the declaration calls for better protecting the old and other high-risk groups, for whom COVID-19 is more dangerous than influenza. By contrast, for children, COVID-19 is less dangerous than influenza. Children and low-risk young adults should be allowed to live near normal lives as they face greater medical, psychological and economic harms from lockdowns than from COVID-19. Immunity among low-risk young adults could also shorten the length of the pandemic, making it easier for older people to protect themselves. Denying in-person teaching to students is harmful to their education and physical and mental health, with working-class children hardest hit. Online schooling puts a disproportional burden on our children, despite their own minimal risk. For ages 1 to 15, Sweden kept day care and schools open throughout the height of the pandemic, and among the 1.8 million children of that age, there were zero COVID-19 deaths without masks used or physical distancing. Neither was there any excess risk for in-person teachers compared with the average of other professions. Some argue that it is impossible to separate older and younger generations. While 100 separation is impossible, lockdowns have successfully shifted infection risk from the professional class to the working class and nursing home residents. It is no more challenging to shift infection risk from high-mortality-risk older people to low-mortality-risk younger adults, including the young bankers, attorneys, journalists and scientists who are now protected.135 Philadelphia PD Ordered Officers Not to Arrest Rioters, Looters136 DAVID HARRIS JR  The police in Philadelphia were told not to arrest anyone. Deputy Police Commissioner Melvin Singleton allegedly ordered police not to arrest any of the rioters. That makes no sense. If you dont arrest them, they will just go ransack another business. Yet, somehow the police did manage to arrest ninety of them.

Is this the corner into which the Democrats have driven themselves? I think it is. In 1955, the world lived in fear of a nuclear war that would destroy all life on earth. Memories of World War II were quite vivid, and people didnt find it hard to imagine something even worse. In that year C.S. Lewis published another Chronicle of Narnia, The Magicians Nephew. In it he told of a world called Charn. There, in ancient times, two queens battled for supremacy. When she was about to lose that war, Queen Jadis spoke a magic spell, The Deplorable Word, which wiped out every living thing in Charn, leaving only dust and ruins. Are Democrats getting desperate enough to speak their own Deplorable Word? Consider their policies, as proposed by their candidates They have reached a point where there is almost nothing they wont do to get power. Power to impose their socialist fantasies on 350 million people. Power to stifle even the most trivial dissent. Power to re-engineer all our basic social institutions. Power to end America as we know it-forever. Communists have always liked to say you have to break eggs to make an omelet, although never in history did they ever get past the egg-breaking stage. But what were talking about here is breaking all the eggs. All of them. And depend on this if they ever do get back into power, Democrats will change the rules so that theyll never be turned out of power again. Not without a mammoth expenditure of blood, toil, tears, and sweat.151 Trumps Electoral Path to Victory Will it be Enough to Overcome The Steal?152 Big City voter fraud is an acquired skill of the Democratic Party.

But this year, the Covid-19 plandemic has provided the Democrats with the perfect backdrop for massive cheating mail-in ballots. The use of fraudulent mail-in ballots and post-election ballot harvesting is well-documented and will occur at unprecedented levels. In addition to the normal Democratic Party cheating, Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch has recently exposed that 353 out of 3,141 of the nations counties have more registered voters than their current population. So the question is how far will the fraud go and where will it occur? The real concern is in the eight swing states of Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Nevada, and New Hampshire. These eight states will determine the election.153 Van Full of Explosives Discovered in Philly on Third Night of Rioting154 The bomb squad is on the scene at this hour.155 Viral Video Shows Philly Cops Smash SUV Windows, Pull Driver Out156 Viral video from a night of raucous protests in Philadelphia shows baton-wielding cops smashing a cars windows, yanking the driver out and removing a kid from the backseat.

Have you noticed the latest lootings and riots in Philadelphia? Do you think any of it will improve with the current onslaught of immigrants streaming into America? This past week, Time CEO and publisher Edward Felsenthal promoted The Great Reset of America toward a better future. What he didnt do actually deal with what is really happening to us. Why? He sits in his plush leather seat in a plush office in New York City, but doesnt have a clue as to whats happening to all of us average Americans. He then published an article by Ciara Nugent about how were going to make it a better future by building better cities. Both of them would not touch the fact that we remain on course to add 100 million immigrants to our country from a world exploding with more immigrants to-be as the third world adds 83 million new babies, net gain, annually. None of the top mainstream media will educate Americans as to whats coming. Therefore, I responded with two letters.

The Great Reset and the Fourth Industrial Revolution are rebranded terms for technocracy and the old New World Order melded with the transhumanist movement. Technocracy is an economic system of resource allocation that revolves around technology  in particular artificial intelligence, digital surveillance and Big Data collection  and the digitization of industry and government, which in turn allows for the automation of social engineering and social rule, thereby doing away with the need for democratically elected leadership. While the real plan is to usher in a tech-driven dystopia free of democratic controls, they speak of this plan as a way to bring us back into harmony with nature In his report, Corbett summarizes the Great Reset thus At base, the Great Reset is nothing more, and nothing less, than a great propaganda, marketing rollout campaign for a new brand that the would-be global elite are trying to shove down the publics throats Its just a fresh coat of lipstick on a very old pig. This is The New World Order, just redefined. Its just a new label for it. And, as explained by Corbett, for those who forgot about what the New World Order wasis all about, it was all about centralization of control into fewer hands, globalization and transformation of society through Orwellian surveillance technologies. In other words, its technocracy, where we the people know nothing about the ruling elite while every aspect of our lives is surveilled, tracked and manipulated for their gain. Four key take-aways from Corbetts research into the Great Reset are 1. The Great Reset has NOTHING to do with a virus, the COVID-19 pandemic or anything else related to public health. 2. The Great Reset is a coordinated agenda that has been years in the making  The pandemic is simply being used as a convenient cover for an elitist, globalist agenda that has been planned for decades. 3. The Great Reset is NOT the end of globalization  On the contrary, it is globalization turbo-charged. As noted by Schwab in the policy book, COVID-19 The Great Reset, co-written with Thierry Malleret and cited in Corbetts report If no one power can enforce order, our world will suffer from a global order deficit. Unless individual nations and international organizations succeed in finding solutions to better collaborate at the global level, we risk entering an age of entropy in which retrenchment, fragmentation, anger and parochialism will increasingly define our global landscape, making it less intelligible and more disorderly. In other words, theres no room for the spontaneously arising social order that occurs when people are allowed to freely interact. Instead, there must be one power to enforce whatever the desired social-environmental-economic-geopolitical order is. 4. This process is not meant to end  The end of the pandemic will not be the end of this totalitarian, digital enslavement agenda. The plan is not to reset the world back to some earlier state that will allow us all to start over with a cleaner environment and more equitable social structures. The plan is to circumvent democracy and shift global governance into the hands of the few.

Im worried that were being divided and we may never recover. Ive never been swayed by conspiracy theories or opinions from the far left or far right, but what Im seeing now has shaken me to my soul. I am worried about our country. Call me old-fashioned, but I really miss the times before technology showed us how we could manipulate each other. Manipulation between individuals was carried out in-person and up close, and you were either physically or verbally manipulated. By guilt, words, physical actions, or general intimidation you had to be up close and personal in order to effectively manipulate someone. And forget about manipulating large groups of people unless you were a well-spoken politician, snake oil salesman-type evangelist, or a cult leader like Jim Jones or David Koresh.66 American Coup Victims Will Not Go Quietly67 This was a Coup. It lacked, at least for the moment, the spilled blood often associated with a classic coup detat but make no mistake about it  this was a coup. A record number of Americans fought an unusual number of hardships to make certain their voices were heard in the selection of our next president. And, given the stark difference in the candidates visions for Americas future and the growing national divide, that choice was surely not made lightly. So, when we on the right observed one irregularity after another on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, what we needed were answers and transparency. What we got were evasions and coverups. Keep in mind that we have endured over the past 4 years a seeming centurys worth of dishonesty, hoaxes, threats, wild conspiracy theories and widespread corruption from those on the left. Indeed, Liberals appear to have made sport of treating Donald Trump and his supporters much like a cat treats a litter-box. And we got the message There is no limit to just how low they are willing to sink.

The church is said to regularly provide meals and other supplies for the homeless in the area, and were forced to shut down services because of the violence and destruction. According to KOIN news in Portland, staff at the church had to suspend worship services and their outreach programs for the homeless after someone smashed multiple windows during rioting earlier this week.70 Biden Plans Immediate Executive Orders to Reverse Trumps Policies71 Projected President-Elect Joe Biden reportedly plans to sign a series of executive orders soon after being sworn into office on January 20.72 Chicago Weekend Violence At Least 4 Killed, 30 Wounded in Shootings So Far This Weekend73 CHICAGO CBS  At least 34 people have been shot across Chicago since Friday evening, four of them fatally.74 COVID Surge Getting Worse in Western New York75 Health officials are reporting an explosion of new COVID-19 cases nationwide, and Western New York is not immune.76 Cutting the Cable News Cord77 Sadly, modern-day major news broadcasts cannot be trusted to deliver news, much less serve as watchdogs.78 Detroit Ballot Tabulators Entered Names of Non-Voters During Count79 Two observers who were at the TFC Center in Detroit during the absentee ballot counting process have produced affidavits claiming they witnessed workers create new voter files with information obtained from ballots.80 Fox News Pulls Justice With Judge Jeanine Over Voter Fraud Claims81 The Fox News Channel did not air Justice with Jeanine Pirro on Saturday night.82 Glitchy Dominion Voting Systems Tied to Clintons, Pelosi, Widely Used in Battleground States83 A reported glitch in the software of Dominion Voting Systems equipment saw 6,000 votes switched from Republican to Democrat in Antrim County, Michigan on Tuesday. The county clerk caught the issue and it has reportedly been corrected. Similar glitches with the software were reported in Georgia. The county clerk Sheryl Guy came forward and said tabulating software glitched and caused a miscalculation of the votes, Michigan GOP chair Laura Cox said. Antrim County had to hand-count all of the ballots. And all these counties that use this software need to closely examine their results for similar discrepancies. The Denver-based companys Dominion Democracy Suite 5.5 software was used in 69 counties in Michigan on Tuesday.84 In 30 States, A Computer System Known to be Defective is Tallying Votes85 Update 1100ET Further down the Domminion Voting System rabbit-hole, Politico reports that a technology glitch that halted voting in two Georgia counties on Tuesday morning was caused by a vendor uploading an update to their election machines the night before, a county election supervisor said. Voters were unable to cast machine ballots for a couple of hours in Morgan and Spalding counties after the electronic devices crashed, state officials said. In response to the delays, Superior Court Judge W. Fletcher Sams extended voting until 11 p.m. The counties use voting machines made by Dominion Voting Systems and electronic poll books  used to sign in voters  made by KnowInk. Neither Dominion nor KnowInk responded to a request to comment. A spokesperson for the secretary of states office also did not respond to follow-up questions about who uploaded the dataset and whether it had been reviewed and tested by anyone beforehand. As American Thinkers Andrea Widburg detailed earlier, when Kyle Becker heard about the glitchy computer program in Antrim County, Michigan, the one that tried to give 6,000 Trump votes to Biden, he starting doing research into the system. He ended up finding an amazing amount of highly disturbing information. The Dominion system has been known for some time to be defective, yet 28 states use it. This post is a compilation of Beckers information, both in his own tweets and in one other persons tweet, about whats going on with that system In Texas, Dominion Voting Systems was turned down THREE TIMES for certification in state elections.

It involved a large-scale repression of wealthy peasants kulaks genocidal acts against ethnic minorities a purge of the Communist Party, government officials, and the Red Army leadership widespread police surveillance suspicion of saboteurs counter-revolutionaries imprisonment and arbitrary executions. Historians estimate the total number of deaths due to Stalinist repression in 1937-38 to be between 680,000 and 1,200,000. A list from the Great Purge signed by Stalin, Molotov, Kaganovich, Voroshilov, Mikoyan, and Chubar. The term repression was officially used to describe the prosecution of people considered counter-revolutionaries and enemies of the people by the leader of the Soviet Union at the time, Joseph Stalin. On Friday Democrat operatives organized the Trump Accountability Project. Democrats are putting together a list of Trump supporters to punish after they steal the 2020 election.

Mothafar had his initial appearance in front of U.S. Magistrate Judge Jolie A. Russo yesterday. Due to the fact that Mothafar has physical disabilities and is confined to a wheelchair, the government did not seek detention. Rather, Mothafar was released on conditions including limitations on travel and the use of electronic devices.100 President Trump Accuses Biden of Rushing to Falsely Pose as Winner As Fake News Networks Call Election for Biden101 President Trump isnt going to let Joe Biden and the crooked Democrats steal the 2020 election. He just came out to say that Biden is rushing to falsely pose as winner. The networks are trying to push the narrative that Joe Biden is president because theyre saying Biden won Pennsylvania but there are still many unanswered questions about voter fraud. Supreme Court Justice Alito has also ordered any and all ballot received in Pennsylvania after polls closed to be segregated All county boards of election are hereby ordered, pending further order of the Court, to comply with the following guidance provided by the Secretary of the Commonwealth on October 28 and November 1, namely, 1 that all ballots received by mail after 800 p.m. on November 3 be segregated and kept in a secure, safe and sealed container separate from other voted ballots, and 2 that all such ballots, if counted, be counted separately.102 Recounts and Canvasses Are Unlikely to Reverse Contaminated Vote Republicans Must Seek Relief in State Legislatures103 The only relief that can be sought by the President and Republican candidates in the swing states that will realistically hand the presidency to the legitimate election winner, President Trump, will be in the state legislatures.104 Report Wisconsin Election Clerks May Have Illegally Altered Thousands of Ballots105 Poll workers in Wisconsin may have unlawfully altered thousands of mail-in ballots due to unlawful guidance from the states election commission, according to a report.106 Report Wisconsin Election Clerks Tampered With Thousands of Ballots107 Poll workers handling absentee ballots in Wisconsin received direction from election authorities to illegally alter ballots with missing information. The missing information  by law  made those absentee ballots invalid and ineligible to be included in tabulation. But a report coming out of Wisconsin reveals that poll workers and ballot counters were given instruction by the Wisconsin Elections Commission WEC to write in missing absentee ballot witness information on ballots that were missing that information. Wisconsin law mandates that an absentee ballot requires a signature from a witness who also lists his or her address. This is to prevent voter fraud. Should a ballot not contain this witness information  including the witnesses address, the ballot is disallowed. It must be returned to the voter so that the witness can provide the required information or be rendered a spoiled ballot and excluded from tabulations.108 Rod Blagojevich Democrats Have Been Stealing Votes for Years109 Former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich comments on the contested results across several key states in the presidential election match-up between President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden, and the schemes he believes are going on at voting sites.  with Newsmax TVs Rob Schmitt.110 Saturdays Media Declaration is a Naked Attempt to Silence Republicans, And Nothing Has Changed111 Nothing has changed since Friday night. You might find that strange, given the media stampede to certify the election results for their man, but its crucial. The calls made Saturday morning are as arbitrary as they were last Tuesday, could just as easily have waited for Monday, and fly in the face of massive evidence of voter irregularities that, at minimum, should be heard in court before anyone considers calling the election. Add pending lawsuits and official recounts in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, Michigan and Wisconsin, and the conclusion is an attempt by the American media to pick our president and decide our election. The danger comes now, when in concert with Silicon Valley censors they use their own decree to dismiss and silence anyone who says otherwise.112 The American People Deserve Explanations for These Election Anomalies113 The big news networks seem to be pretending that they arent there, but the truth is that there are some very serious statistical anomalies that really need to be explained. The integrity of our elections is of the utmost importance, and over the last 24 hours I have seen some things that concern me greatly. I think that the mainstream media is assuming that they can just go ahead and declare victory for Joe Biden and that all of these anomalies will soon be forgotten, but I dont think that Trump and his supporters will let this go. The stakes in this election are so high, and it wont be so easy to sweep things under the rug like we have seen in the aftermath of past elections.114 The Kafka Election Finding a Way Out of the Maze115 Various irregularities have been reported in five big cities, all in strategic states, and particularly in Detroit, Mich. Philadelphia, Pa. Atlanta, Ga. Milwaukee, Wis. and Las Vegas, Nev. The allegations range from mysterious ballot drops that seem to show tens of thousands of votes for Joe Biden and zero votes for President Trump, inexplicable record turnouts in late-counting counties all Democrat-dominated that far surpass turnouts in counties in other states where the votes were counted on a timely basis and of course the illegal banning of election observers in those very counties where the most outrageous anomalies are reported. Democrats tell us that there is nothing to see here, and the compliant media dutifully moves along, unwilling to investigate on its own or even express any concern about potential wrongdoing. Even Fox News has turned into a lapdog for the Democrat Party, calling Arizona for Joe Biden long before anyone could know for sure which way the state would turn. On Thursday night, as Fulton County was just about to swing Georgia into the Biden column, CNNs John King arrogantly lectured Donald Trump Guess what, Mr. President? Were gonna count the votes, and if they favor you, were gonna show that. And if they dont, were gonna show that. Thats how democracy works. Were just counting the votes. Um, no, thats not the way it works. News channels dont count a damn thing. They just report numbers shipped out by election offices in various counties across the country, and if CNN or any other news outfit were actually doing their jobs, they would be alert for patterns suggesting fraud in the numbers they report. If just counting the votes were all that it took to have a democracy, then Vladimir Putins Russia would be a glorious example of democracy, as would the Islamic Republic of Iran So that brings us to the constitutional solution. This one is more elegant, but it still requires a heady dose of chutzpah. As noted, under Article II of the U.S. Constitution, the state legislatures are solely responsible for determining how each states electors are appointed. If a legislature were convinced that the presidential election in that state was tainted, it could convene and pass an emergency resolution declaring the election null and void and then choose to appoint a slate of electors by fiat. Since the claim of misconduct is being made by Republicans against Democrats, you can assume that it would take Republican-controlled legislatures to make such a bold move. Fortuitously, Republicans do control both houses of the legislature in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia and Arizona. Nevada alone among the contested states has a Democratic legislature. If legislators are convinced that the presidency has been wrested out of Republican hands through chicanery or corruption, they could set the matter right by exercising their constitutional prerogative. This is a heavy lift also, but if states intend to ever exercise their authority under our federal system of government, there would be no more appropriate time to do so than when one party seeks to arrogate unto itself power that it has not earned through a free and fair election. The republic is at stake, and thats not just a nightmare. Its reality.116 Top Pennsylvania Republicans Urge Gov. Wolf to Immediately Audit Election117 Top Republicans in the Pennsylvania Legislature called on Gov. Tom Wolf D Friday to carry out an immediate audit of the 2020 elections.118 Trump Lawyer Wants Recount in 28 States With Glitch That Flipped 6,000 Votes to Biden119 Democratic Party candidate Joe Biden declared himself winner on Saturday based on incomplete results in Pennsylvania, site of an ongoing legal battle over the validity of postal votes received after polling day. US President Donald Trumps campaign attorney has demanded recounts in every state using the software that wrongly gave 6,000 votes to Democrats in one Michigan county. Jay Sekulows comments to Fox News on Friday followed revelations that the Dominion Voting Systems vote-tallying machine software that erroneously flipped Antrim County in Michigan from the Republicans was being used in at least 28 states  including the key swing states where the result is being contested. Those states include Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada and Pennsylvania, all key swing states. Democratic party challenger Joe Biden is leading the count in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania by wafer-thin margins of between 7,000 and 35,000. This week it emerged that the Dominion software crashed voting machines in Georgias Spalding and Morgan counties crashed for two hours on election day after the company uploaded an update to them the night before. Spalding County election supervisor Marcia Ridley said the firm uploaded something last night, which is not normal, and it caused a glitch.120 Trump Says Election Far From Over Biden Honored amp38 Humbled After MSM Declares Him President-Elect121 The mainstream media has launched a coordinated effort to proclaim Joe Biden President-Elect. President Trump and his campaign team have reminded Americans that legal votes decide who is president, not the news media. As Constitutional lawyer, Jenna Ellis explains Joe Biden is not the president-elect just because media declares him so. Media coordinated efforts are attempting to simply declare Joe Biden the president and ignore the rule of law. There is no official winner until every legal vote is counted accurately, the states certify results, and all legal challenges are resolved. As a reminder, here are the official dates that matter as opposed to what CNN et al. think. December 8 States are expected to resolve controversies at least six days before the meeting of electors. December 14 Electors meet in respective states to certify their votes for President and Vice President. As Trump said earlier, this election is far from over.122 Two Statistical Curiosities That Allowed Biden to Pull Ahead in PA Please Share123 Update With Benfords Law Criticism A brief note. Ive been asked to examine the Pennsylvania votes. That work is ongoing. Update See below for a serious critique of Benfords law. Im showing here with permission the one analysis I found most curious. This is official county-level timed voting data that started at 2020-11-04 110000, a day after the election, to 2020-11-07 112900 which is Saturday night. That is, these are all late vote counts. They start, county by county, where the vote left off on election night. This is a picture of the running totals by the time the votes were added, summed across all counties, during those time periods. They do not start at 0, but at the totals given after election night.124 Video Alex Jones Goes to Arizona, Confronts Antifa, Joins Pro-Trump Protests125 Talk radio and television host Alex Jones received a heros welcome in Maricopa County, Arizona when he showed up to lead a demonstration in support of a fair election, as controversy swirls around Democrat candidate Joe Bidens bizarre jump into the lead in key battleground states in the wee hours of the morning. Jones appearance in Maricopa County was reminiscent of a rock stars entrance into Woodstock in the 1960s. As far back as the eye could see, the legendary freedom activist mas mobbed and cheered on by thousands of Pro-Trump protesters.126 Virginia In Tight Race, Officials Miraculously Find 15,000 Mostly Dem Votes on USB Flash Drive127 Amid accusations of massive battleground state election fraud meant to swing the Presidential race for Democrat Joe Biden, outraged voters in the 7th District of Virginia are sounding the alarm after incumbent Democrat Abigail Spanberger was propelled to victory by the discovery of nearly 15,000 early absentee votes stored on a thumb drive in the Richmond suburb of Henrico County. In a chain of events similar to those that have played out around the country, with roughly 85 of votes reported as being tallied, Republican challenger Nick Freitas, as well as President Donald Trump, led their respective races in the 7th District by a wide margin, only to see those leads evaporate the next day following the ballots apparent discovery.128 Wait Just a Minute!

Its about liberty versus tyranny  in some form and degree.134 Wisconsin Clerks May Have Unlawfully Altered Thousands of Absentee Ballots135 County and municipal clerks and poll workers across Wisconsin may have unlawfully altered witness statements on thousands of mail-in ballots across the state, The Dan ODonnell Show has learned. Wisconsin Statute 6.86 provides that an absentee ballot must be signed by a witness, who is also required to list his or her address. If a witness address is not listed, then the ballot is considered invalid and must be returned to the voter to have the witness correct. Instead, multiple sources tell The Dan ODonnell Show, municipal clerks and vote counters across the state simply filled out witness signatures themselves. Acting on false and unlawful advice from the Wisconsin Elections Commission WEC, these clerks may have inadvertently invalidated thousands of absentee votes. The statute is very, very clear, said retired Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman, who worked as a poll watcher in Milwaukee on Election Day. If an absentee ballot does not have a witness address on it, its not valid. That ballot is not valid.136 Bad Start Anti-Brexit Biden Declines Comment to British Media  The BBC? Im Irish137 British-American relations under a potential Biden presidency are off to a bad start, with the 77-year-old Democrat declining to give comment to the British press, saying The BBC? Im Irish. Vote counting in the U.S. continues in some areas and results have not been officially certified, with President Donald Trump alleging fraud and declining to concede  yet much of the mainstream media have declared Mr Biden the winner or at least the projected winner of the election regardless.138 Belgian Police Arrest 2 Minors Suspected of Plotting Attack139 BRUSSELS  The office of Belgiums federal prosecutor says two underage people suspected of plotting what it called a terror attack have been arrested. Aged 16 and 17, they were arrested on Oct. 31 following raids in the cities of Eupen and La Calamine, located in the province of Liege. The prosecutors office said they are suspected of attempted terrorist assassination and participation in a terrorist organization. The two minors have been placed in a youth protection center. According to Belgian broadcaster RTBF, the two suspects had recorded a video of allegiance to the Islamic State group and are suspected of planning a stabbing attack against police officers.140 Dutch Teacher Who Posted Jihadi-Mocking Cartoon Forced Into Hiding by Threats141 A Dutch teacher in the city of Rotterdam was allegedly forced to go into hiding after receiving threats when he posted a picture of a cartoon mocking jihadists. The teacher is said to have received various threats after posting a cartoon of a decapitated man with a Charlie Hebdo t-shirt sticking is tongue out at a jihadist with a bloody sword.142 Intelligence Services Islamic Terrorism Has Never Disappeared From Europe143 According to intelligence services, the threat of terrorist attacks in Europe is long-term. Radical Islamism has not disappeared in recent years, but most attacks have not become known to the wide public due to the low number of victims. Rather than extensive attacks, the current problem is the terrorist acts of individuals that are difficult to predict. The murder of the teacher in Paris, the massacre in the church in Nice, and the terrorist attack in the center of Vienna on Monday are just a few examples of attacks in recent weeks. Besides them, there were several other incidents, which have since been forgotten, such as the machete attack in Dresden or violence and murders in the French suburbs.144 Italy Salvini and Allies Demand Govt Suspend Taxes in Lockdown Areas145 Populist Senator Matteo Salvinis League, along with their allies Forza Italia, has called on the Italian government to suspend taxes in areas under lockdown to save local businesses.

In its macroeconomic forecast, on the other hand, the EC worsened the prospects for the recovery of the Czech economy next year, when gross domestic product is expected to increase by only 3.1 percent. This is 1.4 percentage points less than in its summer forecast. The slower economic recovery is related to the second wave of the pandemic due to which the Czech Government, as in the spring, had to enact measures that led to a significant reduction in economic activity, the EC reasoned.148 UK Churchills Legacy Considered for Review by Imperial War Museum After Black Lives Matter149 The legacy of Britains wartime leader, Sir Winston Churchill, is reported to have been under review at the Imperial War Museum, in the latest blow against British history amid the iconoclastic Black Lives Matter unrest. Churchill has long been a target of ire for the radical leftist movement, which has accused the man credited with defeating Nazi Germany of being racist and a colonialist.150 UK Man Jailed for Running Over 5-Year-Old, Slashing 10-Year-Olds Neck, Stabbing Old Man and Young Mother151 A 33-year-old man received a life sentence for a string of gruesome attacks which saw him run over a five-year-old, slash the throat of a 10-year-old boy, and stab a mother walking with her children and a man in his seventies in the head. Carlos Racitalal was convicted of four counts of attempted murder for his attacks, perpetrated on four separate occasions, at Leicestershire Crown Court, along with three counts of possession of a bladed article, according to an official Leicestershire Police news bulletin.152 UK Pics Queen, 94, Leaves Isolation to Lay Flowers at Tomb of the Unknown Warrior153 Queen Elizabeth II left isolation to lay flowers at the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior, as Britain attempts to commemorate the fallen despite the coronavirus lockdown. Britains 94-year-old monarch, the only European head of state to have seen some service in the Second World War, training as a driver and mechanic in the Auxiliary Territorial Service, has been following government instructions to shield since it began regulating against the pandemic, making few public appearances  but was unwilling to sit out the countrys annual commemorations for the glorious dead.154 Why is it Right to Question the Orthodox COVID-19 Narrative?155 So, how do we go about evaluating the effectiveness of lockdowns? Where is the evidence that the virus ultimately causes far more deaths in the absence of extreme social restrictions? Where are those countries that followed a different course from countries like the UK which locked down, but did not suppress the virus and now have higher death tolls than us? By simply assuming that his counterfactual claim is true, Bramble illustrates our worry that lockdowns risk becoming an unfalsifiable article of faith. In fact, he even asserts that the science on this is beyond question. Is it really? If so, all the disease modelers who have made dire predictions concerning the current UK situation will be delighted to hear that their work will be forever immune from critique, even if it turns out that their models have little bearing on reality. And, in any case, none of them would endorse Brambles exaggerated claim that, without a lockdown, there would have been many millions of deaths in countries such as the UK.In fact, much about the behaviour of this virus remains unclear, including how the infection rate is influenced by growing immunity within a population. There is no single, homogeneous entity called the science. Rather, there are many different and often conflicting perspectives, theories, and claims. Furthermore, this is a complicated, fast-changing situation that impacts on all aspects of human society. Relevant expertise thus encompasses a wide range of academic disciplines and areas of practice. Philosophers should not simply defer to the experts they also have plenty of relevant expertise themselves. What we do know is that lockdowns are immensely damaging in so many ways. This second UK lockdown will further disrupt the social and emotional development of our children, cause a substantial rise in severe mental health problems, force many elderly people to live out the final weeks and perhaps months of their lives in loneliness and misery, exacerbate and prolong the pain of bereavement by depriving people of interpersonal and social interactions that shape and regulate grief, destroy livelihoods and risk mass unemployment, increase regional social and economic inequalities, reduce the life-opportunities of young people while saddling them with an ever-growing mountain of debt to pay off, suspend much of what gives our lives meaning, deprive people of countless precious, irreplaceable life-moments, and cause deaths due to the numerous resulting impacts on peoples health. However, the true extent of certain harms, such as the long-term effects of sustained lockdown measures on childrens development, may not become fully clear for some time.156 With Hungary Under Threat, PM Orban Implies Possible Veto of Seven-Year Budget in Letter to EU Leaders157 Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is ready to veto the EU budget and the recovery fund if the payment of funds to individual member states is subject to the rule of law, according to a report from Mandiner. Hungarys veto threat comes after the German presidency of the Council of the European Union and the negotiators of the European Parliament reached an agreement on the conditionality of EU funds, which both the conservative governments of Hungary and Poland believe is a serious threat. According to the draft, if the European Commission detects a breach of the rule of law or a risk thereof in a member state, it can launch the initiation of a sanction mechanism. The sanctions would be decided by the European Council by a qualified majority vote, and thus on the possible suspension of EU funds. In such a scenario, Hungary and Poland would be unable to veto the sanctions.158 Erdogans Jihad on Infidel Europe159 The jihad against Europe by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is probably based on both ideology and opportunism. Fierce anti-Western rhetoric is an ideological sine qua non for Turkish political Islam it is also a secure vote-catcher targeting conservative and nationalist masses. Erdogans jihadism is not seasonal or a newfound system of political ideas. It is also not a reflection of peaceful sufism. Erdogan comes from the ranks of Turkeys militant political Islamism that emerged in late 1960s under the leadership of the ideologue, Necmettin Erbakan, Turkeys first Islamist prime minister and Erdogans mentor. In Erbakans rhetoric universal politics is simply about a struggle between the righteous Islam and a coalition of Zionists and racist imperialists  all else is just details. In his thinking, the Zionists support Turkeys membership in the European Union in order to get Turkish Muslims to melt in a pot of Christianity. In a 2016 speech, Erdogan talked of European countries These are not just our enemies Behind them are plans and plots and other powers. Also in 2016, he said that jihad is never terrorism. It is resurrection It is to give life, to build It is to fight the enemies of Islam. In 2017, Erdogan added that the German governments actions resembled those of Nazi Germany.160 Turkey The Return of Demons161 Our past was in Asia but our future is in Europe! This was how Mesut Yilmaz portrayed his vision for Turkey in a panel debate in Davos in the 1990s. At the time, Yilmaz, who died last week at the age of 73, was one of the rising stars of Turkish politics and a generation that seemed destined to complete a revolution that had started in the 1880s in the Ottoman Empire. That revolution had aimed at transforming the moribund empire into a modern Western-style state capable of reversing more than a century of decline that had earned the caliphate the sobriquet of Sick man of Europe. By the start of the 20th century, however, it had become clear that building a modern European-style state, based on the Westphalian principles, required the existence of a nation also in the European sense of the term an impossible task as long as the Ottoman state remained a multi-national empire whose legitimacy was based on religion which, by definition, excludes the very concept of a nation-state.162 India Killed Because She Refused to Convert and Marry Him Posters Outside Nikita Tomars House Seek Death Penalty for Her Murderer Touseef163 21-year-old Hindu girl Nikita Tomar was shot dead by one Tauseef, who belongs to an influential family of Congress politicians, in broad daylight outside her college on October 26 Monday, allegedly after she refused his proposal for marriage. The family of the deceased, seeking justice for their young daughter who was brutally murdered by Touseef, have now put up posters outside their house stating Tauseefs motive behind the murder and seeking justice for their daughters brutal killing. According to the report by Swarajya journalist Swati Goyal Sharma, the family who has been mourning the untimely death of their daughter, have put up two large posters on the entrance of the house. One reads Laado hum sharminda hain tere kaatil zinda hain. Haryana sarkar hosh mein aao. Hatyaron ko faarsi do. India wants justice for Nikita Tomar Dear, we are ashamed that your killers are still alive. Come to senses, Haryana government. Hang the killers. India wants justice for Nikita Tomar.164 Largest State-Run Chinese Newspaper Laughs at Trump in First Reaction to Biden Win165 Within mere minutes of major US networks in what appeared a coordinated effort declared Joe Biden President-Elect the official newspaper of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued its first reaction which took the form of gleeful mockery.

Two laughing emoji were also included in the message.166 Study Offers More Proof That UV Light Kills Coronavirus167 Regular UV light is widely used to eliminate germs on surfaces, but has a wavelength of 254 nanometers, an intense UV exposure which scientists say can actually penetrate the human body. However, a team at Hiroshima University found Ultraviolet C light with a wavelength of 222 nanometers offers a safer but still effective way to kill SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, without harming human cells. While 254-nm light can break through the outer layer of dead cells on the skin and eyes, irradiating human tissue, the Far-UVC light cannot penetrate human skin or eyes. Not only that, but after just 30 seconds of exposure, researchers discovered 222-nm light kills 99.7 of the virus. The findings offer hospitals safer ways to sterilize work areas while keeping staff and patients out of danger.168 Exclusive How Cashed-Up Southerners Fleeing COVID-Hit Melbourne and Sydney Are Moving to Coastal Queensland and Pricing Out Locals  With Some Ending Up Sleeping in Tents169 The COVID-19 pandemic saw an influx of southerners making the move north, driving rental prices up and availability down to next to nothing.170 The Job No Australian Wants Furious Farmers Question Why Dole Bludgers Are Choosing to Take Government Handouts Instead of Picking Fruit and Cashing in on 6k Relocation Incentive171 Farmers in parts of Queensland, NSW, Victoria and SA claim they have to plough their bumper crops into the ground due to a critical shortage of fruit pickers in the peak season.172 The Real Cost of Lockdown Australia Faces a Mental Health Crisis With Young Women Most at Risk After Thousands Were Left Unemployed173 As COVID-19 cases continue to dwindle, Professor McGorry cited predictions from more recent scientific models that Australia would face a second curve of mental ill-health and suicide.174 Mexican President Imprudent to Congratulate Biden Before Elections Legal Issues Resolved175 Mexicos President said it is too early to congratulate any of the U.S. presidential candidates since the elections still have several pending legal issues.

The assault is only the latest in spate of barbaric anti-Christian attacks to take place across Western Europe in the past month. The 19-year-old migrant attacker, who was known to authorities for previous drug and assault offenses, hit the elderly nun in the face, knocking her to the floor, as she traveled on the bus with another religious sister on Saturday afternoon.

After reviewing captured video footage from the bus, the State Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Counter Terrorism promptly identified the Afghan-born assailant and arrested him. Shortly after his arrest, upon being interrogated by police, the Afghan migrant confessed to the crime. According to police, the motive for the attack is still unclear.178 Canary Islands See 1,600 Migrants Arrive Over Weekend179 More than 1,600 African migrants have been rescued at sea or reached Spains Canary Islands over the weekend, Spanish emergency services said.

Customs spokeswoman Lada Temnakova said that this was a usual inspection in which customs officers on the D2 highway stopped and inspected a tractor with a semi-trailer. It had a Turkish license plate. There were two drivers inside, and according to the documents, they were supposed to be transporting tiles, said the spokeswoman. However, a large-object X-ray by the customs officers revealed people inside the trailer. The customs officers thus made the truck park near the small town of Podivin, and around 5 p.m., people gradually started coming out of it with the assistance of police officers. They are young men and one woman there is no child among them. They said they were from Syria and headed for Germany, the spokeswoman added.182 Germany Mayor Blames Crime on Right-Wingers That Was Actually Committed by Muslim Migrants183 Here is the disconnect between the establishment narrative regarding the right-wing threat and Islamophobia on the one hand, and reality on the other. Egyptians carry out attacks on Syrians, translated from gypter verübt Anschlge auf Syrer, by Sven Hadon, Bild, November 4, 2020 thanks to Medforth.184 UK Migrant Crossings Eight Migrants Brought Ashore by Border Force185 Eight migrants have been brought ashore by immigration officials after almost 100 made the journey in just two days.

The Migration Watch UK analysis found that some 9,400 foreign national offenders FNOs are living free in communities across the United Kingdom, up from under 4,000 in 2012.188 Information War? Internet Archive to Rewrite History With Alerts for Fact-CheckedSites189 According to an Archive.org blog post, you will now know if a page was pulled down or received an alert over what fact-checkers consider misinformation. This also includes dead web pages that were archived. The Internet Archive has started adding fact checks and context to Wayback Machine pages to explain just why the pages were removed. If a page was part of a disinformation campaign or pulled due to a policy violation, a distinct yellow banner will explain why. The fact checks will come from a variety of mainstream outlets, including FactCheck.org, Politifact, the Associated Press, and the Washington Post. Which absolutely in no way will be manipulated, right? Of course, thats obvious sarcasm, as those controlling what is and isnt disinformation will be the wolves guarding the hen house so to speak. A good question to ask is how does Archive.org treat verifiable information like the Bush administration lying about WMDs, the Al-Nayirah testimony lie that almost sunk us into a war with Afghanistan or the validated conspiratorial facts surrounding 911, like the hijackers being given Visas from the Saudi Arabia consulate, as documented by Michael Springmann, who worked as the Head of the Visa Department at the CIAs consulate in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Comment Commies are continuouslt rewriting history everywhere. Orwell 1984 has come to life.190 The Popes New Encyclical A Surrender?191 The Popes Encyclical Fratelli Tutti Brothers All sadly seems more a massive and unwieldy political document than a religious guide to the Catholic faithful. The encyclicals intended audience appears to be secular world rather than people of faith. The 43,000-word tome contains almost no discussion of Catholic dogmas. Although the Pontiffs diagnosis of the worlds ills seems accurate enough, unfortunately his proposed antidotes  equality of result rather than equality of opportunity and individual liberty, the bedrocks of Western democracies  would seriously threaten freedom. The Pope, for instance, implies that the twilight of the planets centuries old diplomatic nation-state system has arrived, prompting the need for a more globalist political system. Regrettably, that usually brings with it no transparency, no accountability and no recourse. Think of the United Nations, the UN Human Rights Council, the International Criminal Court or the European Union.192  1 427836  2 427834  3 427846  4 427896  5 427922  6 427932  7 427866  8 427850  9 427898  10 427832  11 427814  12 427860  13 427876  14 427826  15 427934  16 427848  17 427856  18 427924  19 427838  20 427874  21 427862  22 427902  23 427842  24 427870  25 427824  26 427818  27 427854  28 427830  29 427888  30 427872  31 427904  32 427900  33 427864  34 427858  35 427868  36 427828  37 427936  38 427928  39 427944  40 427914  41 427942  42 427912  43 427946  44 427940  45 427938  46 427840  47 427906  48 427894  49 427892  50 427926  51 427822  52 427844  53 427881  54 427885  55 427883  56 427852  57 427916  58 427918  59 427908  60 427930  61 427920  62 427948  63 427820  64 427890  65  66 topheadline  67  68 topheadline  69  70 topheadline  71  72 topheadline  73  74 topheadline  75  76 topheadline  77  78 topheadline  79 rbreitbart3116VedCO7Qw  80 topheadline  81  82 topheadline  83  84 topheadline  85  86 topheadline  87 rbreitbart3B6HHZDNS1wY  88 topheadline  89  90 topheadline  91  92 topheadline  93  94 topheadline  95  96 topheadline  97 rbreitbart3jT4ELpgQ6aI  98 topheadline  99  100 topheadline  101  102 topheadline  103  104 topheadline  105 rbreitbart3WN_8cAs0GEI  106 topheadline  107  108 topheadline  109 38featureyoutu.be  110 topheadline  111  112 topheadline  113  114 topheadline  115  116 topheadline  117 rbreitbart30lycAxutT0w  118 topheadline  119  120 topheadline  121  122 topheadline  123  124 topheadline  125  126 topheadline  127  128 topheadline  129  130 topheadline  131 rbreitbart35oGyBUgjlTE  132 topheadline  133  134 topheadline  135  136 topheadline  137  138 topheadline  139  140 topheadline  141  142 topheadline  143  144 topheadline  145  146 topheadline  147  148 topheadline  149  150 topheadline  151  152 topheadline  153  154 topheadline  155  156 topheadline  157  158 topheadline  159  160 topheadline  161  162 topheadline  163  164 topheadline  165  166 topheadline  167  168 topheadline  169  170 topheadline  171  172 topheadline  173  174 topheadline  175 rbreitbart3xGNRkTAYaZU  176 topheadline  177  178 topheadline  179  180 topheadline  181  182 topheadline  183  184 topheadline  185  186 topheadline  187  188 topheadline  189  190 topheadline  191  192 topheadline",homeless

As most of us can attest, Monopoly requires a level of commitment that no family game night should require, and its not really that fun of a game to begin with. Hasbros new Monopoly Socialism, though, sounds like a hoot and a great way to continue to teach my kids why socialism is for the math economics and history-challenged among us. Sadly, I have been completely unaware of this new game that mocks socialism as only a brilliant capitalist company can. It was only after stumbling across a Twitter thread composed by a deeply offended socialist that Monopoly Socialism entered my consciousness. So, thank you, Twitter and upset socialist dude.73 I Am Not Suicidal,  Says Man Who Exposed Hillarys Ties to Google74 On Monday, President Donald Trump tweeted out a study on Google bias from Ph.D. psychologist Robert Epstein.

The freshman lawmaker posted a sarcastic video to social media, offering commentary as she drove by empty fields in an effort to delegitimize the importance of the Electoral College and, as a consequence, the Americans it gives a voice to As Breitbart News has previously explained, the Founding Fathers designed the Electoral College as a safeguard against mob rule, essentially preventing high population areas  such as the modern day Northeast Coast and California West Coast  from determining the outcome of presidential elections.

Heres one you havent heard about. I happened upon it by sheer accident. Antwon Rose II was a 17-year-old boy shot by an East Pittsburgh police officer in June 2018 after he bolted from a jitney car that had been stopped by the officer. The Times published about a half-dozen stories on Antwon Rose  or as the Times calls him, Antwon, who was unarmed. After the officer was acquitted on all charges in March of this year, the Times ran an article by Adeel Hassan on the verdict. Heres what you would learn from the Times Comment Their reporting much worse than you think.111 World Famous Porn Star Found Living as a Bum in Las Vegas Tunnels112 Today you are rich, glamorous, famous, happy and ignorant, tomorrow youre just a bum.

Maxime Bernier, the leader of the newly formed Peoples Party of Canada, has been excluded for not meeting the debate criteria the elites set down. If nothing else, Berniers exclusion illustrates how much Canadian voters, real ordinary people, dont matter. The Green Party has been around since the 1980s and currently has about 18,000 members. The PPC on the other hand, created in late 2018, has 40,000 members. That doesnt matter. Bernier should not be worried about being excluded from what is obviously a rigged debate. And CPC leader Andrew Scheer should think twice before wanting to participate. As far as the English language debate is concerned, the presence of the Bloc is irrelevant. It was a given that in the debate, Trudeau, Singh and May would all be ganging up on Scheer who has a good chance of forming the next government. Singh and May have zero chance of governing but would have power if the Liberals wound up with a minority government and needed the help of one or both of the NDP and the Green Party. Lizzie May could end up as the adult in the room and it would be fun to watch her interactions with Justin. It is one thing to realize all the debates participants will be going after Scheer. But it is quite another to decide to have five conservative-hating moderators, members of a union that has announced a campaign against the CPC. Scheer really should back out of a debate that has been formally rigged against him. But he is too much a part of the establishment to do that.115 Chemnitz Trial Syrian Jailed Over Stabbing That Sparked German Far-Right Riots116 A Syrian man has been sentenced in Germany to nine and a half years in prison over the fatal stabbing of a man in Chemnitz last year.

We about the budget, about how to cut taxes and help the Italians. Hw told rteporters youll have to ask the 5-Star Movement M5S about the five conditions for an alliance set by Democratic Party PD leader Nicola Zingaretti. Zingaretti laid down five points to discuss with the M5S loyal membership of the European Union full recognition of representative democracy, starting from the central role of parliament development based on environmental sustainability, a change in the management of migrant flows, with Europe as a full protagonist and a turning point on economic and social recipes, in a redistributive line, which will open a season of investments.123 Italy Full-Term Govt or Elections Says PD Chief Zingaretti124 Sets 5 conditions for M5S, M5S says top party ANSA  Rome, August 21  Centre-left Democratic Party PD chief Nicola Zingaretti on Wednesday called for a government fit to last the remaining three years of the legislative term, saying that if that were not possible, a general election was better. Speaking ahead of government consultations with President Sergio Mattarella Thursday, Zingaretti said after a PD summit a possible new government must be a turning point, lasting the term, or it is better to go to the polls. Mattarella is set to consult all parties on the way forward after Premier Giuseppe Conte resigned after nationalist League leader Matteo Salvini puled the plug on a 14-month alliance with the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement M5S. He will talk to the PD and the M5S separately on Thursday and if they both come out in favour of a long-term government he may give the green light to a premier-designate to explore that possibility. Zingaretti laid down five points to discuss with the M5S loyal membership of the European Union full recognition of representative democracy, starting from the central role of parliament development based on environmental sustainability, a change in the management of migrant flows, with Europe as a full protagonist and a turning point on economic and social recipes, in a redistributive line, which will open a season of investments. It is uncertain whether the M5S will accept these terms. The PD directorate gave Zingaretti a mandate to open talks to verify the possibility of a turning-point government for the legislative term, marking discontinuity with the M5S-League government. The motion granting the mandate was approved unanimously. Zingaretti said I have never demonised the M5S, but we must recognise that there are profound differences with them. The PD leader said he could rule out any under the table stitch-ups or shady deals to cobble together a short-term government. He also said the PD was united and would go to see Mattarella all together to verify the conditions for a new turning point government, useful to the country. Zingaretti ruled out the idea of the PD backing a second government led by Conte. Discontinuity means that obviously we dont want to and cant join a government that proposes a Conte 2, the continuation of a government that we fought, he said. Everyone should get behind the need to start a new government. Zingaretti added with respect to a government that went into crisis, we must give life to a new government that is a new team, but united on the programme. Asked if he might be premier of this possible new government with the M5S, he said he already had two weighty jobs to do, as PD leader and Lazio governor. The M5S, for its part, said Wednesday it was the top party in parliament, with the most seats gained in the 2018 general election, and would speak about possible ways forward towards either a new government or a general election after President Mattarella concludes his consultations with political parties Thursday evening. Following the crisis opened by Matteo Salvini, the M5S said in a statement, the M5S deems it opportune in this highly delicate phase to await the outcome of the consultations which head of State Sergio Mattarella will lead. In these hours we are receiving appeals from many sides and the M5S takes the opportunity to remind all political forces that it is the top party in parliament, with a relative majority. Tomorrow, at the end of the consultations, we will communicate our evaluations. M5S leader Luigi Di Maio has so far not said if he is in favour of a PD tie-up, or against it.125 Leaving the Euro Would be Good for Italy  Borghi126 League budget panel chair tells German magazine Capital  DPA ANSA  Berlin, August 21  Leaving the euro would be good for Italy, the Leagues House budget committee chair Caludio Borghi told German magazine Capital on Wednesday.

Over 70 percent of the legal objections are based on species conservation, especially the threat to endangered bird species and bats, a growing concern around the world. Besides species protection, 17 percent of legal cases deal with noise protection. Another 6 percent of lawsuits deal with monument protection. The German government also forced the wind power industry to cut costs, introducing a market-based tendering model. The economic and legal risks have made investors leery about investing in wind projects without the massive government-mandated subsidies that the wind industry enjoyed. Since the federal government also removed some privileges they had provided for community wind farms, there are no longer enough participants for the public auctions. Comment Wind power will never reach a level where it can survive wthout massive geovernment subsidies.147 The Widespread Desecration of Christian Graves148 Although the persecution by members of some religions of live human beings, such as Jews and Christians, is certainly more monstrous, attacks on inanimate religious symbols possibly give an even clearer indication of a deadly hate borne for the other. Consider, for instance, extremists desecrating and destroying Christian cemeteries and their crosses. While the act itself is largely symbolic  in that no living person gets hurt  it is also reflective of a committed hatred that transcends, say, responding to a physical threat. While the persecution of a Christian can be motivated by particular circumstances  conflicts, sexual attraction, convenience, gain, and so on  attacks on inanimate symbols would seem to reflect a hatred for Christianity and its followers that needs no reason and seemingly gains nothing. From one end of the Middle Eastern world to the other  and in Arab, African and Asian nations, and increasingly in the West  this sort of hate has become a regular occurrence, seemingly normalized. A brief list follows, ordered by desecrations committed by formal terrorists, such as ISIS, al-Qaeda and similar organizations informal terrorists, such as religious mobs and theocratic governments.149 Imminent Threat N.

While reiterating its respect for the Australian judicial system, as stated on 26 February after the first instance verdict was announced, the Holy See acknowledges the courts decision to dismiss Cardinal Pells appeal, a statement released by the Vatican said. It added that the Cardinal has always maintained his innocence throughout the judicial process and that it is his right to appeal to the High Court. Pell had been convicted of one count of sexual penetration of a child under the age of 16 and four counts of an indecent act against a child under the age of 16 and was sentenced in March to six years in prison. The charges were for sexually abusing two 13-year-old choirboys in 1996 when he was archbishop of Melbourne. One victim testified in court while the second victim died of a heroin overdose at the age of 30 in 2014. The Vatican statement ended by saying that together with the Church in Australia, the Holy See confirms its closeness to the victims of sexual abuse and its commitment to pursue, through the competent ecclesiastical authorities, those members of the clergy who commit such abuse.155 Weigel Cardinal Pell Ruling an Australian Disgrace156 An Australian courts rejection of an appeal by Cardinal George Pell of his conviction for historic sexual abuse calls into the gravest doubt the quality of justice in Australia, writes noted Catholic intellectual George Weigel in a stinging analysis Wednesday.

This week the skies above Brazils largest city turned black in the middle of the afternoon due to the massive wildfires that are currently raging in that country. But the wildfires arent actually happening anywhere near Sao Paulo. In fact, the smoke that turned the skies black actually came from fires that were happening more than 1,000 miles away. Can you imagine how powerful the fires have to be in order to do that? And it isnt just Brazil  right now horrific fires are scorching vast stretches of our planet from South America all the way up to the Arctic. Some of the fires are producing so much smoke that you can actually see it from space. And in the process, irreversible damage is being done to our ecosystems. I know that this number is hard to believe, but there have been more than 72,000 wildfires in Brazil so far in 2019, and most of those fires are happening in the Amazon rainforest. I understand that many of you may not care what happens in Brazil, but you should. Approximately 60 percent of the entire Amazon rainforest is in Brazilian territory, and that rainforest produces approximately 20 percent of all the oxygen in our atmosphere. So essentially the lungs of the Earth are being burned away right in front of our eyes161 Austria Afghan Migrant Arrested for Arson Attack Against Freedom Party FP162 A migrant from Afghanistan has been arrested on suspicion of an attempted arson attack against an office of the populist Freedom Party FP.

There is nothing necessarily unethical or unreasonable about eating human flesh, declare psychologists Jared Piazza and Neil McLatchie of Lancaster University, but careful reasoning over the merits of cannibalism is often overridden by our feelings of repulsion and disgust. While not going so far as to recommend cannibalism, saying there is no need to overcome our repulsion for the foreseeable future, the two authors suggest that humans could master their aversion for human flesh if they needed to.

Its your involvement with your M?ori community... and do they see you at home, do they see you around the place, or do you live in Auckland? The son of T?me Rangihaeata and Miri Prime, Tuteri Rangihaeata came home from Auckland and Christchurch 15 months ago to look after his kuia Pauline Bub Prime. Continuing work for his M?ori branding and marketing company Waha, he also became the Ng?ti Hine hap? representative on Te R?nanga o Ng?ti Ruanui. The board said it would support any reps who stood for the ward. Rangihaeata then sought approval from Ng? Rauru and Ng?ruahine. Political party affiliation is rare in Taranaki local government, but he accepted an invitation to stand under the Te P?ti M?ori banner. They approached with mana and dignity, they didnt put any pressure on me, and I had to... take a couple of days to think about it - because I needed to think less about me and more about what value am I going to add to Te P?ti M?ori brand. He said the support gave him the resolve to stand. When we have our wh?nau, our marae, our hap?, our iwi, our r?nanga and Te P?ti M?ori theres no fear. Part of it is also having the support of my cousin and great Debbie Ngarewa-Packer. He wanted to help wh?nau access full services from council, and to protect our iwi and our pepeha from the mountain right down to the ocean and everything in between. The kai sources how healthy are they? How many tuna are in the rivers and streams, how healthy is the watercress and puha? Without a specific policy agenda, Rangihaeata said listening to iwi and hap? would tell him what was needed. Its not just me, Im an opportunity to lift our wh?nau voice in the community one person, many voices is how I see it. In contrast, Katu is taking aim at four specific policy areas. He said the council should encourage local efforts to tackle climate change, such as subsidising solar panels for homeowners, making available more electric car charging points, and planting more trees on public reserves. Planting fruit and nut trees could also strengthen food security, said Katu, and council should also coordinate community gardens and neighbourhood planter boxes. Red tape needed cutting to stop obstructing papak?inga development and encourage affordable housing. Katu said the economy needed boosting with more industry-specific education, and by a shift in community outlook to better welcome immigrants from different ethnic backgrounds. Anyone on the M?ori electoral roll can vote in the M?ori ward elections. Voting papers have already been mailed out and need to be returned by midday, 8 October.

Protesters were trying to pull down the statue with a chain when a guy started waving a gun around he was tackled by protesters but then fired four shots, hitting one person. Shooter appears to have been affiliated with a local militia bunch. Mayor Tim Keller said the statue would be removed until the appropriate civic institutions can determine next steps. KOB-TV9Also in Albuquerque, Mayor Keller announced Monday the formation of a new Albuquerque Community Safety Department that will be set up to respond to 911 calls for substance abuse, homelessness, and mental health, instead of sending police. The new agency will deploy unarmed personnel made up of social workers, housing and homelessness specialists, and violence prevention coordinators, and will be funded in part with money from the police budget as well as other city departments. The Albuquerque police department, which has been under Department of Justice monitoring since a consent decree in 2014, will continue to exist, but will eventually have a smaller footprint.

portland,Top 10 Worst Mayors in America,2021-03-01T00:00:00Z,Conservative Daily News,KATU,"10 - Tim Currier, Massena, New York - Currier, the mayor of the Upstate New York town of Massena, was arrested1 this past December by St. Lawrence County Sheriff officials after being chased by police who were pursing him as part of an undercover investigation. During the chase, the 55-year old Currier threw one gram of crack cocaine out the passengers window of his vehicle. How proud the voters of Massena must be. Currier was charged with, criminal possession of a controlled substance, tampering with physical evidence and failure to comply with a police officer. So, we have a crack-smoking mayor with no respect for police would anyone be surprised to learn that other mayors on this list were also crack-heads? 9 - Steve Adler, Austin, Texas - In one of the more blatant examples of our mainstream medias leftwing bias and complete stupidity, two weeks ago Sen. Ted Cruz R-TX was being crucified2 in the press for taking a trip to Cancun while residents of his state were reeling from unprecedented winter storms and power outages. The press was accusing Cruz of hypocrisy similar to that of Austin Mayor Steve Adler, who had taken a trip3 to Mexico in early-December amid a surge in COVID infections. Adler, who had strongly recommended Austin residents to stay at home during the uptick, took a private jet to Cabo with seven other people after having hosted a wedding for his daughter with twenty guests. While in Mexico, Adler actually took video of his frolicking at the familys timeshare. Thats hypocrisy, folks. Cruz, on the other hand, is a federal legislator with no input on state and local matters who never told folks to stay at home. How is there any comparison? 8 - Keisha Lance Bottoms, Atlanta - Considered a rising star within the Democratic Party, Bottoms spoke at last years Democratic National Convention, and was even offered4 a spot on President Joe Bidens Cabinet. It all makes sense considering Bottoms fits right in with the rest of the party. Last summer, Bottoms tried to implement5 an unconstitutional mask-mandate due to the COVID pandemic, a move that was blocked by Georgia Governor Brian Kemp. Homicides in Atlanta last year soared6 to the highest number since 1998. And her mishandling of riots after the Rayshard Brooks debacle last year resulted in the death7 of an eight-year old little girl. Bottoms has also been fined8 for Campaign Finance violations, a rite of passage for any self-respecting Democrat. Yup, Keisha Lance Bottoms checks all the boxes for Democrats, in fact, she might even be Presidential timber. 7 - Jenny Durkan, Seattle - Last summer as Seattles protest known as the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest CHOP raged on, Durkan tried desperately to downplay the crisis. Durkan described9 the armed protest as more like a block party, and did everything possible to appease the protesters as the situation dragged on. Once it became clear that the protest was highly destructive and deadly - with three people having died10 and national attention on the rise - Durkan tried to regain control, but the damage was done. As a defund the police advocate, and to satisfy those on her radical left, Durkan subsequently moved to cut11 the citys police budget by 20 million, but it didnt work. As is usually the case when one tries to placate anarchists, once the smoke cleared everyone was unhappy. Durkan successfully fought off a recall effort shortly after the CHOP disaster, and then had her taxpayers12 foot the bill for her legal expenses. But she has announced13 that she will not seek reelection to another term good choice Mayor Durkan. 6 - Eric Garcetti, Los Angeles - Mayor Garcetti and California Governor Gavin Newsom arent just cut from the same cloth, they appear to be competing for the title of worst government official in California. At the beginning of the COVID pandemic, Garcetti did his best to set the bar for aspiring government overreach enthusiasts with an idea straight out of a George Orwell novel. Garcetti offered14 rewards to citizens who snitch on neighbors violating his Safer at Home policy, and his passion for control hasnt let up. Ten months after COVID lockdowns began, Garcettis restrictions continue to choke15 the citys business community. Additionally, homelessness in Los Angeles has skyrocketed16 in Los Angeles under Garcettis leadership, beginning long before the pandemic. But perhaps no action by Garcetti justifies his inclusion on this list more than this absurd COVID relief idea. In late-October, Garcetti announced17 a 20 discount on parking tickets to help lessen the financial impact of the virus, stating In moments of crisis, we need to do all we can to support our citizens. Yup, because in moments of crisis we look for this type of assertive, compassionate leadership. Abraham Lincoln, Winston Churchill, and Eric Garcetti in no particular order goose bumps. 5 - Lovely Warren, Rochester New York - When a black Rochester resident named Daniel Prude died last year due to injuries sustained18 while being restrained by police, Mayor Warren did what Democrats do and threw19 her Police Chief under the bus. Warren lied about Chief LaRon Singletarys assessment of Prudes death, falsely claiming that Singletary had called the death an overdose. Nonetheless, Warren went on to fire Singletary, and the investigation into Prudes death continues. Warren mishandled the aftermath of Prudes death, and when a protest turned violent with one serious injury, she demanded that charges be dropped against nine rioters who had been arrested as a result. Police bad, rioters good. For good measure, a month after the riot, Warren was indicted20 by a federal grand jury on two felony counts of campaign finance violations. With such incompetence and corruption, her political career must be doomed, right? Nope. Monroe County Democrats have designated21 Warren as their candidate for a third term. Perhaps Warren should plead guilty to the criminal charges shed probably win reelection in a landslide. 4 - Jacob Frey, Minneapolis - Nine months after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, there is still zero evidence indicating any actions taken by the officers who handled Floyds arrest at the time of his death were driven by race including the lone white officer on the scene, Derek Chauvin. It also seems increasingly likely that the case against Chauvin could fall apart during his trial. Nonetheless, Mayor Jacob Frey, who shortly after Floyds death helped ramp up tensions by arguing22, Being black in America should not be a death sentence, remains defiant. Frey had undoubtedly hoped that such rhetoric would spare him from the very mob he helped urge on, but he was sadly mistaken. Frey was relentlessly jeered23 during a protest in early-June, to the point he had to be escorted away to safety. You can keep feeding those leftist alligators with nonsense, Mayor Frey, but eventually they will come to eat you as well. Frey eventually acquiesced24 to calls for defunding the police, only to backtrack25 two months later and add another 6.4 million to the police departments budget. Meanwhile, violent crime in the city increased26 by 21 last year as Frey was bashing and slashing the cops. So, if you belittle your own police and then take away funding, crime will actually go up? Well, Ill be darned. 3 - Ted Wheeler, Portland OR - Rioting by Black Lives Matter and Antifa went on for over 100 consecutive days in Portland last summer, while Wheeler was the epitome of indecision27. The middle ground is very elusive right now,said Wheeler, as he tried to simultaneously pacify rioters while keeping his city from burning to the ground an effort that failed miserably. Wheeler went so far as to join in the protests, which earned him a proper pepper-spraying28 by federal officers defending the U.S. Courthouse. The rioters eventually turned all of their ire towards Wheeler himself, bringing the riots29 directly to the doorstep of his house as they demanded his resignation. Not surprisingly, Portland saw a 144 increase30 in violence year-over-year. What separates Wheelers incompetence from those of mayors in other cities stricken by race-driven riots is their persistence. While Seattle, Minneapolis and New York saw their riots fizzle out, Portlands riots continued. A riot, in fact, was declared31 on New Years Eve in Portland. Still trying to find that middle ground Ted? 2 - Lori Lightfoot, Chicago - Upon being elected, the left and their media couldnt contain32 their glee over Lightfoots election. Lori Lightfoot is the first black, openly gay woman to be mayor of Chicago, which means she lands in virtually every identity politics category they have. What could go wrong? It never dawned on the left, apparently, that ones skin color, genitalia, and bedroom activities have nothing to do with ones effectiveness. Black, openly gay women can be just as lousy at governance as white, bible-thumping men. Uselessness is nondiscriminatory anyone can be infected with it. After Chicago was pummeled with riots after the death of George Floyd, and after it was clear that Lightfoot had screwed-the-pooch with her handling of the violence, the mayor explained33, No mayor expected what we all got, and how she hoped the riots wouldnt happen again. Hope is for church, and its your job to expect the unexpected, Mayor Lightfoot. Thats why you were elected. During the COVID lockdown in the city, while the rest of Chicagoans were huddled in their living rooms driving each other crazy, Lightfoot was caught going to a beauty salon for a haircut please feel free to insert your own witty comment here about the results 34of that haircut. Was Lightfoot apologetic? Umm, no. The mayor justified her double-standard by explaining35, Im in the public eye every day. Its OK for the mayor to violate her own orders, but not you peons. We can also consider the way in which the teachers union walked all over36 Lightfoot in validating her position on this list. But nothing is more indicative of Lightfoots disastrous performance than the violent crime rate that is plaguing her city. Murders in Chicago jumped37 55 last year compared to 2019, and that is a heartbreaking statistic. 1 - Bill de Blasio, New York City - Yes, he bears a striking resemblance to Lurch from the Addams Family yes hes an unrepentant groundhog assassin38 and yes he ran an absolutely laughable campaign for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 2019. But none of those reasons were part of the formula used to determine his worthiness here. Mayor Bill de Blasio is an absolutely awful mayor. De Blasio botched39 the early days of the COVID pandemic worse than any other government official in the country, and thousands of New Yorkers died as a result. With the pandemic temporarily waning in early-July, de Blasio authorized40 Black Lives Matter protests on city streets, with thousands of unmasked protesters, while keeping the other aspects of his draconian COVID lockdown in place. Due to De Blasios clear contempt for his own police department, and a whopping 1 billion41 cut in its funding, violent crime has absolutely soared42 in the city under de Blasios watch. And millions - yes, literally millions - of city residents have fled43 the city because of de Blasios utter incompetence. Heres a simple question to illustrate exactly how bad de Blasio has been can you name one single thing de Blasio has done well since being mayor? Cue the theme from Jeopardy. Bill de Blasio isnt just the worst mayor in America, hes one of the worst mayors in American history. And again, if were examining the worst mayors, should it be the Top Ten or the Bottom Ten?

By now, vast hordes of unemployed Americans were supposed to be returning to their old jobs and economic activity was supposed to be returning to normal levels. But it hasnt happened that way. Instead, the U.S. economy continues to unravel at a steady pace. Every week more businesses go under, more layoffs are announced and more people get behind on their bills. What we have already been through has been far worse than anything that we experienced during the last recession, and it appears that this new economic downturn is entering yet another new phase. On Thursday, we learned that another 1.106 million Americans filed new claims for unemployment benefits last week The number of people filing for unemployment benefits last week was greater than expected, raising concern about the state of the economy as lawmakers struggle to move forward on a new pandemic stimulus package. The Labor Department said Thursday that initial jobless claims for the week ended Aug. 15 came in at 1.106 million. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected a total of 923,000. Initial claims for the previous week were also revised higher by 8,000 to 971,000. Instead of going down as most analysts were anticipating, the number of initial claims shot way back above a million. And this means that we have now gotten a number that is above a million for 21 of the last 22 weeks. Prior to 2020, the worst weekly number in all of U.S. history was 695,000. To absolutely dwarf that old record for 22 weeks in a row should be almost theoretically impossible. If you would have asked me last year what it would take to have the kind of unemployment numbers that we are seeing now, I would have probably suggested that it would take something like a world war or a major asteroid strike to produce such figures. The numbers that we keep getting week after week are simply absurd, but they just keep coming. Comment This is the goal of globalists feardemic  to destroy western civilization.80 Almost a Million Australians Will be Out of Work for the Next Two Years as Scott Morrison Tells States to Spend More to Create Jobs81 The Prime Minster said the unemployment rate is expected to hover around seven per cent as the economy recovers from the recession caused by the response to coronavirus.82 EU Portugal Sees Largest Drop in Industrial Production83 Industrial production decreased 12.3 percent in the euro area and 11.6 percent in the European Union in June, compared to the same month in 2019, according to Eurostat. With 14.8 percent, Portugal registered the biggest decline among member states, followed by Germany and Spain -14.1 percent each, then Italy -13.7 percent. As the only country of the EU, Ireland saw an increase of it industrial production with 4.5 percent.84 There is No Recovery in Sight, And its All Engineered This Way85 This economic crash was designed, and the purpose of the lockdowns worked perfectly to kill small businesses and impoverish the masses. It was all engineered this way by the political puppets and there is not going to be a recovery. There may be a new system if Americans are stupid enough to allow it, however, there will be no recovery. If we are smart, once this system crashes and burns, we wont replace it with another system at all. We know the agenda and we understand what they are trying to pull off here, says Gregory Mannarino in his latest video. These subhuman individuals must lie, he says of the Federal Reserve banking cartel hellbent on world domination as they intentionally destroy as many people as possible. Its insulting because The Federal Reserve believes that we are stupid, adds Mannarino. Some are, as we have been dumbed down on purpose, but Americans are waking up at an alarming rate. The more the bankers try to control and crash the dollar, the more people will awaken to the chains around their necks and begin to live freely away from this rigged slave system. Theyre trying to manipulate your mind because they think youre stupid, said Mannarino. This is what happens when things are this sick and this twisted. These characters are going to continue to lie to you on an epic scale. Its just the norm these days, the lies, the corruption, the propaganda, the misinformation, the misleading of the people on a scale that I dont think weve ever seen before. And that just plays right into the New World Order, this New America.86 Im Not Gonna Back Down Bannon Responds to Total Political Hit Job Following Arrest87 Former White House strategist Steve Bannon appeared no worse for wear during his War Room Pandemic podcast on Friday  just one day after posting 5 million bail after his arrest on charges of wire fraud and money laundering related to his involvement with Build the Wall  a nonprofit organized by wounded Air Force veteran Brian Kolfage, which raised over 25 million via crowdfunding and built a half-mile section of border wall in Hidalgo County, Texas. Bannon pleaded not guilty, and was in full fight mode during Fridays podcast. This fiasco is a total political hit-job. The timing is exquisite in the run-up to the 2020 election, said Bannon, adding I think it is probably the most important election of our time because the stakes now are so high.88 Wake Up, Motherfr Wake Up!

Lozzi noted that coronavirus was just the final blow to a city already reeling as a result of its progressive attitude towards homelessness. Hollywood has always been the wokest of the woke, so politicians have done nothing to stop people sleeping on the streets. Its not illegal and the weathers nice, so they keep coming, he said, adding that, there is insufficient housing, inadequate mental health care. Add in Covid and its a perfect storm.92 11 Shootings Leave 3 More Dead in New York City93 NEW YORK CITY WABC  The surge in gun violence continues across New York City, as there have been 11 shootings with 15 victims Thursday into Friday.

The propaganda is that being white is a racial privilege that elevates white Americans above other Americans and enables white people to oppress blacks. It doesnt strike those who use the term as a weapon that these same racist white people are the ones who elected Obama president and put Kamala Harris in the Senate. White privilege conveys the idea that white people have impunity. They can abuse, even kill, people of color without consequence. Yet, it is white officer Chauvin who is in jail charged with the murder of black George Floyd, while the two black Maryland teenagers who murdered 59-year old white John Weed at the county fair for not giving them a dollar were sentenced by white female judge Julie Stevenson Solt to anger management training and behavior modification but otherwise unpunished.

As in the Lord of the Rings, they cannot bear letting go of the ring of power. But what will it take for them to finally relinquish their stranglehold on our lives?

Trumps bid for a second president term. Obamas August 19, 2020, address, at the Democratic National Convention, on behalf of Biden, was the clearest indication yet that Obama is working for a third presidential term. He wants vindication for his failed presidency and wants to use Biden as a front for the ultimate capture of state power for revolutionary purposes. In addition to saving political face, Obama represents those here and abroad determined to reduce America to the status of third-rate power, unable or unwilling to stop Red Chinas advance. President Trump has said that he wouldnt have won in 2016 had it not been for Obamas failed presidency. Cashills book is important to understanding why the American people were so desperate for an alternative such as Trump. People were fooled by Obama, his lies, agents and apologists, but they eventually came to understand there was something sinister, even un-American, in the Obama presidency. This was the result not only of Obamas failed policies but the facts about his real agenda that slowly but surely came to the publics attention through alternative media, described as samizdat by Cashill. This is a reference to the unofficial and frowned-upon journalism that served as a channel for freedom fighters in the old Soviet Union. Indeed, he dedicates the book to his fellow Lilliputians, who dared to take on the Gulliver-type powers that be. It gets to the point, and we have arrived at this point today in the United States, where the official outlets for the establishment are not believed anymore, and people are desperate and hungry for alternative voices. Hence, the major media and the Big Tech censors will want to destroy the Cashill book and, if that is not successful, censor any mention of it.112 Chicago Aldermen Delay Decision to Declare State of Emergency at Special Council Meeting113 CHICAGO WLS  City Council voted to send a resolution to declare a state of emergency and deploy the National Guard to the Committee on Public Safety Friday, delaying any concrete decisions.

Its also a time of thanksgiving  for Floridas best-in-the-nation sunshine law that requires practically every government document be made available to the public. As State Attorney General Ashley Moody describes it, the law provides that any records made or received by any public agency in the course of its official business are available for inspection, unless specifically exempted by the Florida Legislature. Over the years, the definition of what constitutes public records has come to include not just traditional written documents such as papers, maps and books, but also tapes, photographs, film, sound recordings and records stored in computers. Plus mugshots of the criminally deranged, more than a few shocking police records of the high and mighty, and everything else in between  all in a state whose warm weather and gorgeous beaches and major theme parks attract a broad selection of humanity unlike almost anywhere else on Earth. Two cheers  with a strong drink in hand  for open government. With all that in mind, join me now on another thrill-a-minute Florida Man Friday!124 Fly Repeatedly Lands on Bloombergs Face During DNC Speech125 A fly landed on Michael Bloombergs face twice during a pre-recorded speech at the Democratic National Convention Thursday night.

One group gathered at Kenton Park located on the 8400 block of North Brandon Avenue. The group left the park around 7 p.m. and began marching throughout neighborhoods in North Portland.

For a couple hours, the group marched through North Portland and later dispersed after returning to Kenton Park. Around 10 p.m., a separate group of about 100 people began gathering outside of the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement ICE building located on the 4300 block of Southwest Macadam Avenue. While the group was outside the ICE building they began blocking vehicular traffic at Southwest Bancroft Street and South Moody Avenue. The group was also supported by several support-type vehicles. At times, these vehicles were seen blocking vehicular traffic. Several people in the crowd were seen carrying shields and wearing helmets and gas masks.134 Jetblue Doubles Down on Kicking Family Off Plane Because 2-Year-Old Wasnt Wearing a Mask135 JetBlue kicked an entire family off one of its flights this week because one 2-year-old child wasnt wearing a face mask, and the airline doubled down on the decision even after intense criticism.

This is in stark contrast to Kalamity Kamala of 21st century America, who would accelerate the downfall of our Democratic Republic in the unlikely event of a Biden-Kalamity win on November 3rd. Why? Because Biden and Kalamity are promising to resurrect the failed policies of the Obama years, and inflict even more damage on America the Beautiful. According to author and television host Mark Levin, although the media are rushing to portray Californias junior senator as a moderate, nothing could be further from the truth. She is the most extremist radical politician ever to run for high office in the U.S.A., Levin states, even farther left than 97 of the Democrats in the U.S. Senate, even left of avowed Marxist Democratic socialist Bernie Sanders. Levin and his guest attorney Mark Pulliam provided several examples. Kalamity Kamala, they said When it comes to support for Jewish issues in America as well as support for Israel, the estimable Daniel Greenfield in his powerful article, The Democrat Party is Getting Rid of Jews, has a warning Obama and Harris both signed off on Irans nuclear program and the flow of money to terrorists. In addition, While Harris has been depicted as a moderate, her chief of staff, Karine Jean-Pierre, was the national spokeswoman and senior adviser for MoveOn, the radical group with a long history of trafficking in anti-Semitism and attacking the Jewish State. And, Greenfield reminds us, Kalamity Kamala is a full-throated supporter of the virulently anti-Semitic members of the so-called SquadCong. Ihlan Omar D-MN, Cong. Rashida Tlaib D-MI, Cong. Ayanna Pressley D-MA, Cong. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez D-NY, and all the others who avidly support both the Boycott-Divest-Sanction BDS movement to destroy Israel economically and to deny foreign aid to Americas staunchest ally in the Middle East. In a chilling but all-too-credible warning, Greenfield says that Jewish Democrats who imagine that Israel is the problem are about to learn theyre the problem.142 Kansas City Chiefs Ban Headdresses, War Paint for Fans Attending Games143 The NFLs Kansas City Chiefs are instituting a new dress code for fans attending their games this season in an effort to be more sensitive to concerns over Native American imagery.

Quite the contrary During the wave of Black Lives Matter rioting that took place during the early summer of 2020, American corporations marched in lockstep. Not only did they use social media to swear fealty to this political movement, but they also made massive internal changes in conformity with BLM propaganda. Its called woke capitalism and while its not necessarily new, its certainly more prevalent than it ever has been. The term itself was coined by conservative editorial writer Ross Douthat in 2018. He succinctly summed up what woke capitalism is superficial nods toward cultural leftism that allow the company to do what it really exists to do  make money. You might be confused or think that theres something ironic or askew about major corporations backing supposed rebel ideologies. However, this stems from a very surface understanding of the topic. When we delve deeper into it, the motivation for large corporations siding with ostensibly anti-capitalist groups will come clearly into focus.172 Doctors Urge Families to Wear Masks at Home as Belgians Tire of COVID Rules173 Growing number of Belgians suspect coronavirus rules are power grab.174 EU Rejects Post-Brexit Deal on Returning Illegals, Trade Talks Deadlocked175 European Union negotiators have reportedly rejected a British offer of a bilateral pact to return illegal migrants, while a seventh round of Brexit trade negotiations has again ended in deadlock.

Majewska went to a social agency in Germany in 2018 to help find a home for herself and her family. She had been living at her mothers home in the meantime.

In a deal with the Libyan Government of National Accord GNA, recognized by the United Nations, Turkey would have access to a naval base located just south of Italy and France. Both countries along with others in the European Union, such as Greece, are worried that the base could cement Ankaras growing power in the Mediterranean, according to Czech news portal Echo24.200 Turkeys Strategic Plan for Libya201 by Alex Kassidiaris The Turkish and Qatari Defense Ministers recently visited Tripoli to meet the head of the Government of National Accord, Fayez al-Sarraj.

Main Objectives of the Meeting Akar was accompanied by Turkish Chief of General Staff Yasar Güler. Both played a crucial role in the outcome of the meeting.

The defense ministers of the supporting countries agreed to provide the GNA forces with cross-functional support, from logistics and military equipment to operational planning and training through expat military advisors. 202 Caroline Glick Is the Palestinian Veto Alive or Dead?203 Since Israel was established, the Palestinian veto doomed all efforts to forge peace between the Arab world and the Jewish state. The Palestinian veto rests on a toxic proposition that Israels right to exist is contingent on its satisfaction of Palestinian claims against it. So long as the Palestinians say they are unappeased, Israel cannot expect the Arab world to either recognize or live at peace with it. The very existence of the veto has ensured that the Palestinians will never be satisfied with any Israeli concession and will never agree to peaceful coexistence with the Jewish state. After all, their global and regional importance is a product of the veto. The Arabs, and much of the rest of the world support the Palestinians because they wield the veto. As holders of the veto, the Palestinians are viewed as the key  or the key obstacle  to Middle East peace. If they give up, or lose the veto, they will lose their position and power to enable or block peace and foment war and instability. As for the Arab leaders, for generations the Palestinian veto was the key to their own power and stability. It enabled them to deflect the attention of their peoples and of the governments of the world away from their corruption, extremism and failure at home and abroad. It enabled them to scapegoat Israel blaming the Jewish state for the suffering and stagnation of their people. Given its toxic power, abrogating the Palestinian veto has always been Israels highest goal. And given its centrality for both the Palestinians and the wider Arab world, for most Israelis, it seemed like a dream so impossible that it wasnt even worth dreaming. The peace treaties Israel signed with Egypt and Jordan were concluded while genuflecting to the Palestinian veto. Egyptian president Anwar Sadat signed Egypts peace deal with Israel only after he concluded a framework deal for Palestinian autonomy with then Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin. King Hussein of Jordan only agreed to sign a peace deal with the Israeli prime minister Yitzchak Rabin after Rabin signed the Oslo peace deal with PLO chief Yassir Arafat on the White House lawn. Since signing their peace treaties with Israel, Egypt and Jordan have continuously breached them by refusing to implement the clauses of their deals that require them to normalize their relations with Israel. Both use the Palestinian veto to justify their material breaches, which have reduced both historic treaties into little more than long-term ceasefires. The big news last Thursday that with U.S. President Donald Trumps mediation, Israel and the United Arab Emirates have agreed to develop full diplomatic ties is being presented as a strategic earthquake. This is so not because the announced deal advances commercial ties between the countries, nor is it being presented in this manner because the deal advances the Israeli-Arab campaign to prevent Iran from advancing its nuclear weapons program. While the deal does both of those things, it is being presented as a strategic earthquake because policymakers and commentators proclaim that it abrogated the Palestinian veto. If these claims are true, then last Thursday Israels diplomatic standing was transformed204205 Tribunal Ruling Clears Hezbollah Leadership, But May Backfire206 by Daniel Davis A UN tribunal vindicated Hezbollah leadership of the 2005 assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri. The ruling, delivered Tuesday, was the result of a 15-year investigation and deliberation. Breaking Point Although the group largely escaped blame, Hezbollah member Salim Jamil Ayyash was found guilty in the murder. Despite the fact that the tribunals conclusion was undoubtedly a victory for the group, it may do more harm than good. That is because the Lebanese people wanted justice. The trial chamber is of the view that Syria and Hezbollah may have had motives to eliminate Mr. Hariri and his political allies, however there is no evidence that the Hezbollah leadership had any involvement in Mr. Hariris murder and there is no direct evidence of Syrian involvement, said Judge David Re, summarizing the 2,600-page verdict. 207 Polish Radio Will Start Broadcasting for Belarus208 The management of Polskie Radio S.A.

As always, well cover the new treatment models that are focused on behavioral modifications and engagement for those who are depressed, anxious or seriously mentally ill. In some ways, software is mimicking what we should be doing as families and communities - engaging constantly with our loved ones, guiding them to see the hope and beauty in life and enabling them to realize theyre capable of changing their unfortunate circumstances, or at the least view them through a more positive lens. Sometimes, however, people truly are mentally ill and they find themselves living on the streets.According to Mental Illness Policy Org2,at least 25 percent of the homeless population suffer from serious mental illness.",homeless
portland,Invent Health - Helping the mentally ill among the homeless,2020-01-29T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,KATU,"Government policies, such as the reduction of psychiatric beds, have certainly contributed. But other policies and cultural norms enable others who are not mentally ill to accept homelessness. The culture of entitlement is not healthy and its not lost on those on the streets. When they demand free housing as a constitutional right, they are casting themselves as victims and promoting a defeatist view of their own abilities. This is where it becomes a problem.Victimology and rampant drug abuse are pervasive at homeless encampments and the combination makes homeless encampments a feeding ground for mental illness. So what can help?One group hoping to do their part in fighting the homeless crisis identifies loss of employment as the No. 1 reason behind people living on the street. The organization, called Downtown Streets Team,3 focuses on helping the homeless get jobs. Its one of the better solutions around because it hits at the heart of the problem. People dont just need a place to live, they need their dignity. In this roundup, heres a curation of some recent articles about whats happening from a public policy and private sector standpoint to address homelessness and mental health. Join us March 25, 2020 for The Future of Mental and Behavioral Health with executives from Kaiser Permanente, Nico Arcino, Head of Strategic Partnerships Headspace Chief Science Officer Dr. Megan Jones Bell Tim Blevins, SVP of Behavioral Health at UnitedHealthcare Optum Ginger.io CEO Russell Glass Andrew Bolwell, Global Head of HP Tech Strategy.REGISTER here.4 Prosecute homeless and sentence them to treatmentRecently California Assemblyman Mike Gatto proposed a measure5 to prosecute the mentally ill homeless people and sentence them into treatment. Importantly, he wants certain crimes, like defecating on public transportation or using heroin or meth in public to be strictly enforced. A special court would be created to determine why those crimes were committed and sentence the defendant to shelters, drug rehab, or an appropriate treatment plan. The conviction would be expunged once a person completes the sentence.The LA Times doesnt agree with Gatto because his plan doesnt like the criminalization aspect. But at the same time, the publication has no alternative solution, only to say Lets concentrate on getting them housing and mental health services. I agree. But lets also not enable and support the homeless lifestyle. Showing compassion also means having faith that teaching the homeless about accountability, consequence and mutual respect for others is part of being in a society. Additionally, Gattos plan certainlybeats the proposal by Chesa Boudin who recently became district attorney of San Francisco. Boudin says that he wouldnt prosecute crimes such as public camping, offering or soliciting sex, public urination, blocking a sidewalk, etc. Boudin blames SFs homelessness on evictions and corporate landlords. But its more than that. Its not more compassionate to allow people to live on the streets. Its compassionate to give them assistance and dignity. Read commentary6on Gattos proposal Read commentary7 on Boudin Kaiser Permanent donates 25M to California homeless situationIn March, Nico Arcino, head of strategic partnerships at Kaiser Permanente will be joining us again. We love having Nico at our events. Meanwhile, KP corporate has been very busy making pledges to help the homeless crisis. This week, KP announced8 that its pledging 5 million to get hundreds off the streets of Portland. A week ago, KP announced a similar program albeit a larger 25 million fund to address Californias homeless crisis. Its likely these plans were influenced by California Gov. Gavin Newsoms executive order creating a 750 million fund to fight homelessness. The funds are to go toward mental health services, subsidized housing, rent, care homes and 100 campers and modular tents to be used as temporary housing. Safe and stable housing is key to a persons physical, mental and social health, said Greg Adams, CEO of the Oakland-based nonprofit healthcare company. Chronic homelessness has been shown to cut 27 years from the average lifespan and is associated with communicable diseases such as hepatitis and typhus, increased hospitalizations, and frequent readmissions. KP also said in a statement Homelessness increases the level and amount of care the health system must provide, even as it limits how successful that care can be. Common conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and asthma are nearly impossible to manage without housing. KPs headquarters are in Oakland, which has seen the largest two-year increase9 of any city in California. If you live around Oakland, youre aware of the large homeless encampment by Home Depot. California will be shutting the10 encampment down in February, according to just-released reports.Read more11. A brief history of mental illness, homelessness and crimeOne of the reasons cited for why mental illness is prolific among the homeless is because of deinstitutionalization12, a government policy circa 1960s that moved mental health patients into federally-funded community mental health centers and away from state-funded insane asylums. Within 40 years, from 1955-1994, about 487,000 patients were discharged from the state-run hospitals, which eventually closed. Additionally, the two groups - the local centers and state-funded centers had conflicts, which led to an exacerbation of the homeless and mental health crisis. In 1972, a study by the National Institute of Mental Health noted that relationships between the community and public mental health facilities exist at a relatively minimal level. Another done in 1979 by the Inspector General of the US Dept. of Health, Education and Welfare said 8216The relationship between the CMHCs community mental health centers and public psychiatric hospital is difficult at best, adversarial at worst.8217 Another reason for the rise in homelessness could be the tough-on-crime policies that drove up incarcerations prior to 2000. The logic is that when people left jail they ended up in the streets. In the last two decades however,according to annual reports issued by the National Conference of State Legislatures13, several hundred state laws were put in motion that make sentencing less rigid and less severe. The result, fewer incarcerations, but which also meant more people on the street.

The results of a new survey has now revealed shocking revelations about what US college students think about violence as a way to shut down speech. Foundation for Individual Rights in Education FIRE, Real Clear Education, and College Pulse conducted a survey across 55 colleges across the US and asked 20,000 students about free speech issues in their campuses.

The AP Stylebook, often regarded as the go-to resource for learning about the accepted norms of English-language media, is now attempting to change the definition of the word riot. Acknowledging the dictionary meaning of the word, which is wild or violent disturbance of the peace, AP suggests that the word cant be used for stigmatizing the groups that are protesting for the sake of racial justice. Using riots to describe a protest for racial justice is not appropriate, as it suggests uncontrolled chaos and pandemonium.115 Atheists Sue Over So Help Me God on Alabama Voter Registration Form116 The Freedom From Religion Foundation filed a federal lawsuit on Thursday against Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill for violating basic First Amendment freedoms by unconstitutionally compelling Alabama  and United States  citizens who want to register to vote to swear so help me God in violation of their conscience.117 Barrett Tests Negative for COVID, McConnell Says Full Steam Ahead With Confirmation Hearings118 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Friday that its full steam ahead with the confirmation process of Supreme Court Justice nominee Amy Coney Barrett, who recently tested negative for coronavirus.119 Biological Weapons Attack Conspiracies Surface Over Suspicious Timing of Trump, GOP Senators, Suddenly Getting Virus120 BIZPAC REVIEW Scores of Americans are developing conspiracy theories about what they see as suspicious timing after President Donald Trump announced Friday he and first lady Melania Trump  and other Republicans  have suddenly contracted the disease.

DARPA Biochip to Save us From COVID Can Control Human DNA154 While half of the American voting public is no doubt waiting in earnest for the announcement of a release of the COVID vaccine and as totalitarian states and governments the world over attempt to require proof of negative tests before travel, a new tool in the shed of government surveillance and control is revealing itself. While many are still attacking anyone warning of the coming Microchip as a conspiracy theorist, Luddite, or religious fanatic, that microchip has arrived. But governments arent having to market the chip as a method to track, trace, and control their populations. Instead, they are marketing the chip as a way to track and detect COVID and other coronaviruses.

For the one-time deputy vice chair of communications for the city Republication Party, it should have been a time of jubilation. As soon as they announced Trump the presumptive winner, were told, Hey, theres a mob of protestors out front, says Smith, who stepped outside to find the San Francisco cops being pushed back by a crowd, some in head-to-toe black clothes, helmets, face masks.

I dont that this will happen, but one can never underestimate just how underhanded Democrats can get. Virtually all Democrats say that voter fraud is non-existent but the evidence is overwhelmingly proving that it is rampant. During the 2018 mid-term election democrat activists were caught teaching illegals how to vote twice because no ID is required. See why Democrats fight voter ID. Democrat activists have been caught red-handed issuing Spanish-language instructions to illegal aliens regarding how to vote not once, but twice, in the midterm elections, while assuring them they will get away with voting Democrat twice because no ID is required. The illegal text messages targeting Spanish-speaking illegal aliens across many states are also spreading fear-based propaganda about President Trump, with many of the messages referring to the president of the United States as the anti-Christ who wants to murder Mexicans.

But his treatments are questionable and he was taken to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, also known as Bethesda Naval Hospital, which is the subject of J.C. Hawkins controversial book, Betrayal at Bethesda. Its a facility hailed by the president and many for first-rate medical care but is also known to be a location where controversial government and political figures can meet their untimely and unexpected ends.

But Hawkins said he was concerned how Trump, after weeks of an extensive work and travel schedule, had suddenly tested positive and came down with symptoms. He said he was also surprised by how suddenly Trump was taken away from the White House and noted the case of James Forrestal, the former secretary of defense who supposedly fell from a 16th-floor window of the Bethesda Naval Hospital on May 22, 1949.

Rapacious and feeling almighty, those involved have engineered diabolical operations to plunder the Holy See, and even get hold of Pope Francis reserved account, the most protected of Vatican coffers. The probe submitted by the papal prosecuting attorney tracking back a 454 million heist depicts a merciless picture of an assault on the financial assets of the Vatican. A London property real-estate deal has given way to a momentous scandal involving a number of monsignors, brokers and business lawyers, besides outlining a snapshot where Pope Bergoglio is a white spot surrounded by black souls who betrayed him. The attorneys summary is shocking The Secretariat of State financed the London operation with a 200 million dollars line of credit coming from Credit Suisse and from Banca della Svizzera Italiana and guaranteed by a pledge of assets the Secretariat of State owns after collecting them through donations to the Peters Pence.

Carried out by the fund managers, it doesnt appear to have had a valid economic reason as of now in the investigations, the Promoter of Justice Gian Piero Milano and his deputy Alessandro Diddi write.

Delivered by Newstex never thought of Apples AirTags as a tool for social justice, but this occurred to Portland lawyer Michael Fuller, who runs what he calls the Underdog Law Office1 and also practices at OlsenDaines2. Zane Sparling of the Portland Tribune reports3 that Fuller was trying to help the homeless who stay at a campsite in a park. Under Oregon law, when the city cleans up homeless encampments, it is required to retain for 30 days any collected property that is recognizable as belonging to a person and having an apparent use so that it can be retrieved, but according to Fuller, the city wasnt doing so.",homeless
portland,In the News,2021-08-06T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,KATU,"To prove this, he placed AirTags in certain property. After the sweep, he tracked the AirTags and learned that the property was brought directly to a dump. The article quotes Fuller as saying Due to the tracking technology, we have proof positive that Rapid Response broke the law and took property that was perfectly clean and sanitary, and belonged to homeless people, and took them to the dump. Joe English of KATU has a similar article4, and he reports that Fuller had previously filed a class action against the City of Portland, and he used 16 AirTags during a subsequent sweep to gather more evidence. This is certainly a clever way to use AirTags. And now, the news of note from the past week Illinois attorney John Voorhees of MacStories discusses the new Quick Note feature5, coming in iPad OS 15 this Fall, and how it makes it easier to do research with an iPad. Currently, if you take a picture with your iPhones camera and there is a light source the sun, a street light, etc. off to the side, you will sometimes see lens flare on the other side of the picture, sometimes in the form of a small slightly green circle. Michael Simon of Macworld reports that when iOS 15 comes out this Fall, it will use AI image processing to remove the lens flare6. Killian Bell of Cult of Mac describes an interesting feature coming to the AirPods Pro this Fall for anyone who could use a little assistance with hearing. The new Conversation Boost feature7 boosts the volume of a person when they are talking in front of you, making it easier to hear and follow along in a face-to-face conversation. Another feature coming this Fall to AirPods as well as CarPlay is an Announce Notifications feature. Michael Potuck of 9to5Mac explains how it works8. The Find My app is also improved in iOS 15. Juli Clover of MacRumors explains what is new9. Jack Nicas of the New York Times reports10 that the iPhone will gain the ability this Fall to recognize certain child pornography uploaded to iCloud and recognize certain nude photographs shared via Messages by an iPhone user under 13 years old. Jason Cross of Macworld provides additional details11 on how it works. The EFF is concerned12 that this technology could open the door to future privacy abuses. Apple posted an interesting profile of Brian Mueller13, the developer of CARROT Weather and other apps, on its Developer site. If you have been watching the Apple TV show Ted Lasso  and you should be!  and you live in California, Jos Adorno of 9to5Mac reports14 that there is a Ted Lasso Believe Experience in Los Angeles and Santa Monica. You can get Ted Lasso merchandise, have biscuits with the boss, take pictures with photo installations, and more. Watching a Broadway musical on TV is not the same as being there live, but it is certainly better than not being there at all. And when done well  such as the Hamilton movie  it can be quite good. Come From Away15 is an excellent musical that I enjoyed when the tour came to New Orleans two years ago. It is based on a true story after 911, planes were forced to land at nearby airports leaving some folks far from their homes for a long period of time. According to Greg Evans of Deadline, the show is coming to Apple TV this September16 and it will include members of the original and the current Broadway casts. I recommend that you see it, and I look forward to seeing it again. Tamara Palmer of Macworld offers a list of iPhone tips17. Nothing new on this list, but some oldies that are goodies. In 2005, when podcasts were relatively new, Steve Jobs described what they were at the All Things D conference as he previewed the addition of podcasts to iTunes so that you could listen to them on an iPad. Dieter Bohn of The Verge provided this link to the video on Twitter18. It was interesting to listen to his enthusiasm for podcasts, which Jobs referred to as the Waynes World of Radio and TiVo for radio for your iPod. For Brett Burney and me19, Im not sure which one of us is Wayne and which one is Garth. Speaking of Steve Jobs, back in 1983, someone sent him a letter to ask if he would sign something. Jobs wrote back to say that he doesnt sign autographs. Now that letter  which Jobs signed, using his distinctive all-lower case signature  is being auctioned off as an autograph20. Bidding starts next week at 1,000. And finally, here is a fun video from Apple21 that shows off three techniques for creating, relatively easily, movie-quality special effects using an iPhone. All three are rather clever. embedded content  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8 38utm_mediumfeedamp38utm_campaignFeed3A9To5Mac-MacAllDay289to5Mac-AppleIntelligence29  9 38utm_mediumreferralamp38utm_campaignFeed3Aloopinsight2Fmembers28TheLoopMembers29  10 38smidurl-share  11  12  13  14 38utm_mediumfeedamp38utm_campaignFeed3A9To5Mac-MacAllDay289to5Mac-AppleIntelligence29  15  16  17  18  19  20  21 38t169s",homeless

When use agreements are extended, the only unit that is made affordable to an assisted family living in the project is its own unit. If that family is offered a portable voucher, many units become affordable to the family. Contrary to the arguments of lobbyists for project-based housing assistance, failing to renew use agreements on subsidized housing projects increases rather than decreases the stock of housing that is affordable to low-income households.",affordable housing

This argument is seriously flawed. Almost all people are currently housed. If we think that their housing is too expensive commonly called unaffordable, the cheapest solution is for the government to pay a part of the rent. The housing voucher program does that.
