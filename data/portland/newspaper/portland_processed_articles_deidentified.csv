DATE3, I published an opinion piece in [ORGANIZATION] urging city leaders to address urgent safety issues in downtown [ORGANIZATION] in part by providing resources for community policing. My opinion piece in [ORGANIZATION] did not address homelessness generally. The word does not appear in the article, because the concerns about safety are not tied solely to that issue. The call for community policing resources got far more attention, but the spotlight needs to be much broader. You would be hard-pressed to name all the agencies and enterprises who are involved in some [STREET] in these inter-related issues. There are issues that touch the state, the city, the county, and there are no doubt resources being spent by public bodies that no one thinks of in connection with homelessness. At times [ORGANIZATION]ers seem to be talking past each other, choosing one side or another to what is inherently a multi-sided issue. We can and should - and We do - show compassion to support individuals in need. At the same time, we can and should provide resources for law enforcement to provide greater safety for all. While this a challenging situation, I refuse to give up, and I would encourage all Oregonians to devote time, attention, and, yes, resources to address the complex issues surrounding homelessness. In meetings with local and state leaders in [PERSON] I have offered to contribute personally to genuine solutions  not policing  and I have reiterated my belief that others in the business community should join this effort. I am glad to call business leaders personally to ask them to contribute. We cannot solve all problems, and we will likely never address all the needs related to homelessness, but as Oregonians we can make meaningful progress if our leaders business, government, nonprofits and others have the will to do so.
