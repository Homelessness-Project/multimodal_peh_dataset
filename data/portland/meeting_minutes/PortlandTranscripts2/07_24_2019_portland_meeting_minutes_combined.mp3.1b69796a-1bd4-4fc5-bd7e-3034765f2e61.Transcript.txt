World Oregon is hosting the Iraqi Youth Leadership Program, a U.S. State Department funded program that brings Iraqi high school students to the U.S. for summer exchanges to explore themes of leadership development, civic rights and responsibilities, respect for diversity and community engagement. They've been in Portland since July 11th and the theme of their program this year is peace building and community resilience. Mayor, can we suspend the rules? We'll suspend the rules. Thanks for joining us today. We appreciate your being here and we appreciate the spirit in which you're here. This is a time where more peace and unity would be a good thing. We appreciate you coming here to learn more about our community and I hope when you leave, you leave with good thoughts. So welcome and thank you for being here. First item, communications. Carla? Item 685, a request of Tamara DeRitter to address council regarding safety concerns in the neighborhood due to the lack of an assigned police officer. Good morning. Good morning. My name is Tamara DeRitter. I'm the chairperson for Rose City Park Neighborhood Association, and it's a pleasure to be here. I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you this morning on this topic. On February 5th, our Rose City Park Neighborhood Association Board directed me to write this letter to the City Council. That was following a presentation by the North Precinct on the status of public safety in our January general membership meeting. Unfortunately, due to my battle with cancer and your public comments schedule, I'm only able to speak with you right now. In January, Sergeant Jennifer Butler reported that there were not enough police officers to assign a permanent neighborhood response team officer to our area. This caused grave concern by the 60 participants at that meeting and then was reflected in the board's direction to me as the chair. The sergeant stated the reason for the problem was due to the reduction of police officers because of the retirements. Over the past five years, our neighborhood has experienced a 300% increase in car thefts, a 400% increase in other forms of thefts and burglaries in our neighborhood. The presentation provided by the police gave no reason to believe the situation would improve under the current conditions. We strongly urge you to return the number of police officers to adequate levels of at least 17 officers per 10,000 residents. Support geographically assigned community police officers as a number one priority for neighborhood livability. It is vital that these officers stay in these assigned areas long enough to understand the community dynamics and become engaged with this community leaders, maybe a minimum of five years assignment. Listen to our police officers concerns as they're dealing with revolving door for thieves and larceny arrests. And a need to reduce the time spent dealing with lawsuits on top of their regular workloads. Encourage the neighborhood response team officers to provide regular updates to the neighborhood meetings in their assigned areas. And let the neighborhood associations help reduce crime through grants for high crime areas. We do understand that the NRT officer, Bob Boylan, has been temporarily assigned to our neighborhood. We would like to see that as a permanent assignment. Thank you. Very good. Thank you. Commissioner Fish. Tamara, you've been battling cancer, and you've been in our thoughts and our prayers, and it's great to see you. You look terrific. Thank you. Thank you. I'm beating it. It's a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. that everyone gets whenever they've been around Roundup, apparently, which I haven't been, but it must have been on the food I ate. So it's working, and I'm just praying for you as well. Well, we're glad you're back on your feet and you're active in your neighborhood and you're here today. So thanks very much. Thank you. Thank you for being here, and I know that you and Robert King have connected in my office as well, so we'll keep that dialogue going as well. Okay. Thanks for being here. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. All right. Next person please, Carla. Item 686, request of Ron Glanville to address Council regarding outer Halsey safety project and maintenance of stop signs at Northeast 132nd and San Rafael. Good morning. Good morning. Thank you. I won't be speaking about the stop signs because it's actually been fixed. My name is Ron Glanville and I serve as the chair of Russell Neighborhood Association and the board of East Portland Neighbors, both the past president and the recording secretary. Vice chair of the PDXCAC, the Port of Portland Airport Community Advisory Committee. I'm a member of EPAP. I've served as chair of East Portland Neighborhood News, which was formerly published by EPN, and various committees including EPM, which is East Portland in Motion. And that's kind of where we start today. I'm here today to advocate for the Outer Halsey Safety Project, which is an ongoing project of PBOT that is almost a 10-year history from the time of EPIM placing it on the second tier of East Portland projects. The project focus is on the sidewalk infills. on Halsey from Northeast 125th to 161st Avenue. This project has been renamed, changed, redesigned, morphed, delayed several times. It is a paramount safety project for outer East Portland, affecting thousands of people in the Wilkes, Wilson, and Hazelwood neighborhoods. Currently, there are about 50 to 60 blocks of this section of Halsey without sidewalks. There are curbs and driveways, but in between is gravel, dirt, weeds, and shrubs, making any pedestrian travel unsafe in most areas. Residents walk or transport themselves on the street pavement along Halsey, where vehicles traffic zooms by at 35 to 45 miles per hour. There have been the improvements of one flashing beacon crosswalk, but for long stretches, there is no safe way to cross Halsey safely. The goal has always been to provide sidewalks in this area so the pedestrians can walk safely. PBOT has been working on this project for many years, but it continues to be stalled. Rich Newlands had been the PBOT employee who had been working on this project for many years and reassured our community that we would see sidewalks in place after much review by East Portland community members. Dan Layden of PBOT has informed me that Rich Newlands has retired. When his retirement is hired, it will move forward. Mr. Layden told me that the project was 60% design complete and that work would commence in 2020. Our community has heard this sort of assurance as many times from PBOT, only to hear that there was an emergency priority, redesign, funding issue, or that there was a delay, etc., Mr. O'Laden is also informing the project will include more flashing beacon crosswalks and ADA corner curb ramps. The project will not include sidewalks on most of south side of Halsey because of current conflict with Metro who is responsible for sidewalks around Glendivere. My goal here today is to urge the completion of this project and to assure the community that after 50 years without sidewalks, a major Portland Boulevard is now safe for its citizens to walk on. Please give it some priority in funding for completion. My understanding is that most of the funding is dedicated for this project. I have seen it on many committee lists as scheduled to be done. Please advocate for this project. Thank you. Commissioner Fritz. Mr. Grenville, thank you for coming in. Have you sent your testimony to Commissioner Eudaly's office? This was sent, yes, I believe so. It was? Great, because I'm sure she and her staff will respond to you. Yes, and I'll send copies also to PBOT. Good. And it's your understanding then, Mr. Glanville, that the funding is in place and PBOT has, in your estimation, committed to moving forward with the project? Yes. Is that accurate? There has been money both from the dime fund. tax plus also other funds that have been scrabbled together to make this happen. It has been funded actually for a couple of years, but it has not been moving forward. It seems to be stalled. Very good. And I'll follow up with Commissioner Udaili. Sorry. Thank you for being here. Thank you. We appreciate it. Next individual, please, Carla. Okay. Item 687, request of Gloria Buchor-Luzader to address council regarding the proposed houseless village on North Richmond Street in St. John's. Good morning. Good morning. Show you how dedicated I am. I came by max. Very good. Darn right. There's no parking down here, baby. Good morning. Morning. Amanda, Ted, Nick. My name is Gloria Buchor-Luzader. I am a native Portland person. I graduated from James John Elementary School, Roosevelt High School, and Portland State University. I was born in a manual hospital and carried home by my parents to the St. John's community in North Portland. After working in Oregon, Washington State, South Korea, and China, I returned to St. John's. I am living in my inherited deceased parents home built in 1911. A one bedroom, one bathroom, 800 square foot cottage. It is St. John's, it is home. I am here today because I truly believe a mistake is being made by placing a hard wall public housing camp on North Richmond Avenue between North Lombard Street and North Central Street. This location is 50 feet from a preschool in a church, 675 feet from James John Elementary School, and 850 feet from the St. John's Public Library. I volunteer at James John three mornings a week with first and second graders. These are children who are five, six, seven, and eight years old. Children who walk to school on North Central Street, who sometimes would cut through the preschool parking lot and run across the grassy lot that is being proposed for the hard wall public housing camp. Please, a major safety factor to consider for the children. I truly believe there are more suitable locations in this city and in St. John's. There are locations that are not near a preschool, an elementary school, and a public library. Please consider the children of St. John's who walk to their school and walk to their library in your final decision. Thank you very much for listening. Thank you. You're welcome. Thanks for being here. Next individual please, Carla. Item 688, request. Okay, so it's summer and I hoped that I would not have to do this, but I will remind you that that is in violation of council rules. This is a warning and if I have to ask again, I'm going to have to have you leave. Next individual, please. Item 688, request of D. White to address council regarding the failure of the Water Bureau to deliver safe drinking water to its customers. Good morning. Good morning. My name is Dee White. I am sorry and sad to report that Portland's drinking water continues to have one of the highest levels of lead, in fact, in the top six for all urban water systems. Last month, Gresham exceeded the federal limit. By reporting levels as high as Portland did in 2018, Gresham is a Portland Water customer. Last month, Portland Water Bureau reported higher levels than their last two monitoring periods, once again violating EPA's directive from three years ago to immediately and significantly reduce lead using existing facilities. Portland hovers around and above the federal limit year after year after year. Even at very low level exposure, the effects of lead on brain development in babies in uteri, infants, and young children are profound and irreversible. There is no cure for this neurotoxin. There is no safe level of lead. It is invisible, tasteless, and odorless. A 2018 study estimates that more than 400,000 adults deaths in the US every year via cardiovascular and renal disease can be linked to chronic lead exposure. This community has endured chronic levels of lead in our water for years. The Water Commissioner's opinion is that it's property owners' responsibility to prevent lead from leaching into drinking water. They are wrong. Federal law requires public water systems to take action to reduce lead contamination, primarily by treating corrosive water in our homes, schools, parks, and businesses. The law is about correcting faulty treatment, not about faulting customer plumbing. This is your legal responsibility, not ours. The Oregon Health Authority, the regulator, has been letting you guys off the hook for 27 years. Why is this? What kind of hold do you guys have over the regulators? You are not complying with the federal law or the 2016 EPA orders and all we continue to hear from you and Salem are crickets. Ignoring optimal water treatment and not maintaining the water distribution pipes has simply been kicked down the road with only carefully worded promises to improve lead levels. The silent public health crisis continues. How is this acceptable? Commissioner Fritz. Ms. White, thank you very much for making the case for why the lead control... treatment plant is necessary. That's later on the agenda today. Obviously, it's a large project that takes time to get done. I'm sure that the Water Bureau will be giving a brief summary of the treatment plant and when it's expected to go online. In the meantime, anybody who's concerned about whether their home might have lead in it, can call 823 4000 and ask for a lead testing kit that's 503 823 4000, ask for a lead testing kit they will send you one in the mail with a free water bureau bottle which you get to keep, a drinking water bottle, I've done it myself and it's really easy to do and That way you will know whether you need to run your pipes for two minutes at the beginning before you drink the water. But again, call 823-4000 and we'll send you a lead testing kit if you're at all concerned. Commissioner, could I ask a clarifying question? Because Ms. White comes in on a regular basis and gives this testimony. And I did some research after the last time she came. And she is correct in that the Water Bureau did testing. and found elevated levels of lead, but it is also true that the testing they did was specifically conducted in high-risk homes that they knew used lead solder in the pipes. So is there lead in the drinking water that's coming out of Bull Run, going through the public pipes, and then into the homes? Is there lead in that water, or is the lead in the houses that have used lead solder? Because it's my understanding it is the latter. And that the Portland Water Bureau, in fact, has a very aggressive program to help homeowners who do have lead solder pipes in their house, in their private property, to convert those pipes to non-lead solder pipes. I'm glad you asked me that question, Mayor, because since you assigned me the Water Bureau in September of last year, I have learned so much about our drinking water system. Felly, mewn gwirionedd, mae ein system dŵr yn cael ei ddod o'r system cyfan, heb gael ei ddod o'r sefydliadau unigol. Yn amlwg, mae'n fach newid y ffitioedd, a'n enwedig mewn lleoliadau, mae'r dweuddol ddim yn bosibl gwneud hynny. Ond, mewn gwirionedd, rydyn ni'n bach rydyn ni'n cael ein bodd yn blestig a'n cael ein bodd yn blestig gan y dŵr rhwng y bwrdd hyfryd. Oherwydd y dŵr rhwng y bwrdd yw phur 7, sydd yn unol iawn, nid yn ysgol, nid yn alcalin. Mae'n digwydd nad yw hynny'n dda iawn i gynllunio y dŵr. Dyna pam rydym yn adeiladu'r plant trafod sy'n mynd i wneud y dŵr yn ychydig yn fwy alcalin, sydd yna yn llai am ddod yn llaw. ysgolion o'r cwmni. Felly nid yw'r canolfan dŵr yn dod i mewn, ond y pipio yn y casglu yn reacwyl â phh penodol ein dŵr. Yn gywir. Yn gywir. Roeddwn i eisiau sicrhau ein bod yn cyd-destun. Ac er bod hynny'n digwydd, rhedeg y dŵr ar ôl ei fod wedi bod yn seilio am ddwy munud, os os ydych wedi bod yn sefyll ar y llaw, os ydych wedi'i rhedeg am ddwy munud, yna bydd eich dŵr tap yn mynd i fod ar lefelau cyffredinol. Ac eto, gallwch brofi hynny gyda'r gwartheg ffroedd a byddai'r Cymru Gwyddonol yn eu hannog. Gallwch ofyn am ddwy gwartheg, un ar ôl ei fod wedi bod yn sefyll, ac yna un ar ôl ei fod wedi bod yn rhedeg am ddwy munud. Iawn, mae hynny'n hynod o ddiddorol. Rwy'n diolch am hynny. Diolch. Yr un olaf, os gwelwch. Un olaf, 689, cyfl Diolch am fod yma. Ie. Ddaw, Cyngor y Deyrnas. Fy enw i yw Peter Salinger ac rwy'n ymdrin yn ysgol Gwrent a rwy'n cyfrifol yn y Cyngor Hynnydau Cymru o Portland, a gafodd ei greu yn 2017 gyda'r cyflawniad o'r Rhesoliad Gwneutr Gwneutr 100% i gyngor y ddinas ar broblemau o ran hinsawdd. Fe hoffwn ddechrau gan ddiolch i'r ddinas am y fforwm cyhoeddus ar Zenith yr wythnos diwethaf. Mae'r cyd-dynion fel hyn sy'n cynyddu y cymhwyso'r cymhwyso cyhoeddus yng nghanol y ddinas ni yn ymwneud â chyfrifoldeb yn y cyfnod hinsawdd. Gobeithiwn y byddai'n gyntaf o lawer. Y materion yr ydym ni'n dod i'w ymwybyddu amdanyn nhw heddiw ymwneud â'r Codd y Portlant. Yn ystod y gwrs, cyrff ein cyngorau cyntaf wedi darllen adroddiad o'r Tribwne y Portlant yn enwedig Lwos at Wapato. Roedd yn ei allu arwain y ffaith yw bod tri acres o drioedd o'r trae Ar ôl gweld yn ymlaen at y cod tre, roeddem yn sylweddoli nad oedd y mater yn cyflawni i trefiau yng Nghymru. Yn 2011, pan oedd y ddinas Portlawn yn gwaith cael cod tre, roedd y diwydiant yn cyflwyno protest ar ddyfodol, yn gofyn eu bod yn rhaid iddynt fod yn amgylcheddododododododododod o ran bod llwyth o ddynion diwydiant wedi'u cymryd ar yr adeg. Roedd y ddinas yn ymwybodol o'r pwysau, ac yn y diwedd yn gweithio ar ddynion diwydiant a chymdeithasol heb ei ddynio, gyda'r dyfodol y byddai'r Roedd y ddinas Portland yn gwneud canlyniad am gyfleoedd economaidd ym mis Dŵn 2016 ac yn dod o hyd i fod cymaint o ddynion diogelu a chymdeithasol wedi cael eu cymryd. Ond mae'r ardaloedd hyn yn parhau i gael eu llenwi o'r Codd Ddynol Portland ac maen nhw i'r diwedd. Mae'r llenwiau diogelu a chymdeithasol wedi gadael rhai o'r ffyniadau mwyaf gwerthfawr o Portland yn ffynniol ac, yn ystod y crisis hinsawdd, mae hynny'n ddim ond yn ddiffygol, ond yn anodd i lawr. In our fight against climate change, trees are some of our most valuable assets. The City of Portland should not be in the business of giving industrial and commercial interests unnecessary protection at the expense of our environment. In addition to the industrial and commercial exemptions, we would like to bring one other issue to your attention. The provision in the Tree Code which boosts protections and mitigation requirements for the largest trees in Portland has a sunset clause set for December 31, 2019. Allowing the sunset cause to remain would cause irreparable damage to Portland's urban environment. We have heard recent rumors that it is now very likely that the trees at Wapato will come down. It is up to the City Council to prevent further unnecessary environmental destruction like this. We have testified before the Urban Forestry Commission and met with Gen Cairo and other city staffers, but in the end, it is up to you to put a stop to this problem. The Portland City Council calls on you to remove the tree code exemptions on industrial and commercial zones, exemptions that have existed far past their needed expiration date. In addition, we are asking you to remove the sunset clause on the mitigation requirements for large trees, ensuring that Portland maintains and protects its environment for years to come. Thank you, and we appreciate your time. Thank you for being here. Appreciate it. Nice job. There is no consent agenda today, so we'll just move into the first item on the regular agenda, please. S-690. Amend acquisition of public art code to expand eligible uses of the 2% funds, explicitly prioritize underserved communities, and clarify city accountability. Colleagues, this is the second reading. There's already been a presentation and public testimony. Is there any further business on this item? Seeing none, please call the roll. Fritz? Yes. Thank you, Commissioner Fish and Commissioner Udaele and all the staff who've worked on this project. I wasn't here for the hearing, but I've reviewed the record and I'm pleased to vote aye. Fish. First of all, I want to just be clear what this does. It prioritizes underserved communities access to art. It expands the eligible uses of the 2% funds to include creative space and more clearly allow activities like artists in residence. And it clarifies Portland City Code to make explicit the roles and responsibilities of the council, the eligible bureaus, and the art council. So, it has a very specific purpose. I want to thank Commissioner Udalli and particularly her arts advisor, Polly, for their strong partnership. I want to thank Tracy Schreiber in my office and Jamie Dunphy. And I also want to thank our friends at RAC, including Madison Cario, the new executive director for their partnership. This is a step in the right direction, which gives us more flexibility. with the 2% funds and allows us to advance both our equity agenda and our affordable art space agenda, and today I'm pleased to vote aye. Wheeler. I'd like to thank Commissioner Fish and Commissioner Udaly. I think this is great policy, and I agree with what you just said, Commissioner. It definitely moves us in the right direction, both in terms of living up to the oft-stated goals around equity. This is one more concrete action that we can take to actually deliver resources in support of those equity goals. And I concur that I think this will be very helpful in terms of maintaining affordable art space. I'm happy to vote aye. The ordinance is adopted. Next item, 691, please. Accept negotiated price of $8,185,616 from James W. Fowler Company for the construction of the Leach Upper Garden Project. Colleagues, this is a great milestone in the Leach Botanical Garden Project. Leach is a city landmark and East Portland's hidden gem. But thanks to this project, it won't be hidden much longer. The Leach Garden Project will make this beautiful place truly a world class destination. Joining our city's other famous gardens like the International Rose Test Garden, the Japanese Garden, the Lansu Chinese Garden, and the Crystal Springs Rotodendron Garden. The redeveloped garden will include incredible new spaces like a pollinator garden, aerial tree walk, and more. I want to thank our partners who are contributing to this, including Metro, Prosper Portland, and generous donors who have contributed to Leach Garden Friends. Colleagues, in March, Council approved an alternative to the traditional low bid process because of the unique needs of this project. Today, we are being asked to consider awarding a contract to James F. Fowler Company. And we have a presentation from Lester Spitler, Chief Procurement Officer, and Ross Swanson, Parks Project Manager. Gentlemen. Good morning. Morning. Thank you. As Commissioner Fish said, I'm Lester Spitler, the Chief Procurement Officer. City Council adopted Ordinance 189427 on March 20th. that approved an exemption to the competitive low bid process. We also proposed issuing a two-step negotiated RFP process, which was something new for the city. The two-step nature is the first step is a request for qualifications. We sought out prime contractors and subcontractors that could meet the requirements of the project. And then we qualified those prime contractors and subcontractors and then issued a request for proposals as the second step to those pre-qualified contractors. So on May 6th, we issued the second step request for proposals. We received two responses as a result of that. Those proposals were reviewed and evaluated by a five-member evaluation committee, including one member of the minority evaluator program. And the evaluation committee selected James W. Fowler as the highest scoring proposer for this project. The city has established a 20% aspirational goal for state of Oregon certified disadvantaged minority owned women owned emerging small businesses and service disabled veteran owned businesses. For subcontractor work as well as supplier utilization. James W. Fowler has made a commitment of 34.64% utilization of certified subcontractors and material suppliers. 22.98% of that is for disadvantaged business enterprises and 11.66% is to emerging small businesses. The breakdown of that work, there's a subcontractor, Eagle Striping Services. They are certified as an emerging small business. They are going to perform striping work. The ownership is Caucasian female. Another subcontractor, Igami Construction, is a disadvantaged minority owned and emerging small business. They're going to do some signage work for the project and they are Asian Pacific and female. Eugene William Construction is a disadvantaged minority owned and emerging small business. They'll perform excavation work. They are Native American male owned. Faison Construction will perform concrete, African American male owned company. Innovative Manufacturing and Design is an emerging small business. They'll perform metal fabrication. They're a Caucasian male owned company. Regional Traffic Management is a disadvantaged minority owned and emerging small business. They will perform traffic control and they are Asian Pacific male owned. And Treecology is an emerging small business and they will perform arborist work and they are a Caucasian male-owned company as well. In addition to the 34.64%, since proposals were received, there is an additional subcontractor that James W. Fowler is going to use that has become certified by the state of Oregon. That's Pacific Landscape Services. They're a woman-owned business enterprise and they will be performing landscape services and they are a Caucasian female-owned company. So with that increase, that raises the percentage of utilization up to 55.28%, which is double what our aspirational goal is. That's phenomenal. We're really happy about that. James W. Fowler is located in Dallas, Oregon. They are not certified. They are in compliance with all of the city's contract requirements. With that, we recommend that you accept this report and authorize execution of this contract. Ross and I are here for any questions. Thank you. Yeah, the original estimate was what and how far above the estimate is this particular bid? So originally it was $6.7 million, and the bid came in at $8.7 million. We were able to negotiate that down to $8.1, which you see here today, after the two-step process in working in good faith with the contractor. And what explains the, when you look at the bids that came in and you debrief this, why did the bids come in well above the estimates? That's a good question. On the large scale marketplace right now, there's a lot of public money in the marketplace. It's actually going in the ground as we speak this summer. So trying to get good bidders who have the capacity to take on a project like this at the right price is probably issue one. And that trickles its way down as we're negotiating the cost down with the subcontractors. You can get Fowler to move off of their numbers, but they were having issues getting the subcontractors. Again, with the firms that they got as subcontractors, they're smaller firms, and their prices were sort of somewhat fixed. That's item one. Item two is we do have a lot of steel in the project, so there's – although – There's a lot of speculation in the steel market, so those numbers were not able to move very much. And then finally, timeline. We've requested that this be done in one year. That is not an easy task for the amount of work that's being done. So the contractors, as well as the subcontractors, plan on gearing up to a larger scale, and they will be working on this project six days a week to make sure that we get the timeline done. You mentioned the cost of steel, and you said it was speculative. Is steel one of those commodities impacted by the tariff discussions? I asked that question. They were hesitant to answer that directly. That adds to the speculation, but I think to the most part, they just went back to the marketplace. This is a landscape project predominantly, but it does have a lot of steel. The buildings that you're seeing going up all over the city, I think there are 12 cranes right now in the city. That's driving the steel just from a supply and demand issue. So the good news is our construction industry is... working at near full capacity, the bad news is that builds in some inflation in terms of bidding costs. Yes, exactly. So we're generating systems development charges on a lot of construction work that's going on around the city, which helps us invest in our parks, but at the same time, our costs are going to go up a little bit. Yes, that is, yes. Thank you very much. So to Commissioner Fish's point, everybody's bidding a little higher because they're anticipating a roll-up in the construction input costs, predominantly steel and concrete and labor, of course. And so when you got to the point where it came back at 8.8, you negotiated it down about 8% by my quick and dirty calculation. What are you actually negotiating down? Is that just who's going to take the risk for the potential increase in construction inputs? Or are you actually reducing scope? That's a good question. So your first characterization is always, no matter what change order you're having, you're trying to figure out who's taking on the risk, whether it's owner or contractor. I will say Fowler and their team have been excellent to work with in those two weeks of negotiations. They've been pretty transparent, and I would say the process that we have done merit to that ability to be transparent. And then, sorry I'm drawing a blank here. There was the balance of risk. What was it? Oh, scope. We actually, so the big item that came out of this scope was a misinterpretation of our warranty. The landscape contractor had assumed quite a large one-year obligation that they were going to have staff out there sort of making sure everything is, you know, at a premium level for the entire year. We have the benefit on this project that we have leech garden friends out there who have a huge volunteer staff as well as professional garden zone staff. So when we started comparing notes on who thought we were taking care of what, we were able to reduce a lot of that scope. It's not scoped. It's actually going to go on the ground. In this case, it's just maintenance scope. There are some other issues and small items, and we've also identified future savings just from timing for this to get under contract. We've agreed to defer those additional savings talks to hopefully August 1 when we're under contract. Very good. I'll entertain a motion. Move the report. Second. We have a motion from Commissioner Fish, a second from Commissioner Fritz. Any further discussion, please call the roll. Fritz.
 Fritz. Commissioner Fish, you've been a champion for Leach Gardens as long as I've known you, and you must be very delighted that this project is moving forward. Once, once, and thank you so much. I did it again. Ross Swanson. Delightful having, especially when I was in charge of Portland Parks, to have Portland Parks and Rec. Thank you. Done in a very different way, and I really appreciate the work that you do to make sure that everything gets done correctly on time, on budget. And great minority and women participation. Thank you, Mr. Spittler, for that as well. Aye. Fish? Well, Commissioner Fritz, right back at you. You've been a champion of the leech garden. It is fantastic. hidden gem in East Portland. It will be one of the great attractions in East Portland when this investment is concluded. And as we heard in the presentation, there's a sense of urgency in terms of doing the work, because in June of 2020, Portland is hosting the American Public Garden Movement. Yeah. and we'll have the most important people in that movement here for a convention and we want to show off all of our great gardens, including Leach Botanical Gardens. So thank you for an excellent report. I vote aye. Wheeler? I'm happy to support this. I vote aye. The report's accepted. Thank you. Thank you. Next item, 692, also a second reading. Assess property for system development charge contracts, private plumbing loan contracts, and safety net loan deferral contracts. Colleagues, this is a second reading. We've already heard a presentation and taken public testimony. Is there any further discussion on this item? Seeing none, please call the roll. Fritz? Aye.
 Fish?
 Aye.
 Wheeler? I vote aye. The ordinance is adopted. Next item, 693, please. Aye. authorize the Water Bureau to acquire certain property and easements necessary for construction of the corrosion control improvements project through the exercise of the city's eminent domain authority as a last resort. Commissioner Fritz. Thank you, Mayor. This is the project that we were hearing about or alluding to earlier to do the treatment facility, and so I'll turn it over to staff to give a presentation. Thank you. Great. My name is Ben Gossett. I'm the right-of-way manager of the Portland Water Bureau. Good morning, Mayor. Good morning, Commissioners. Morning. I'm here to talk to you about five properties where the Water Bureau will be acquiring easements. And on one of those properties, we will also be acquiring small parcel and fee. These improvements are related to our corrosion control project that will reduce the corrosion of lead in the household plumbing. We have a PowerPoint for you. In just a moment, you'll see a map that will give you the approximate locations of the easements. Incidentally, most of the easements are being revised within their existing location. Some of these easements are... Yeah, you can just grab the whole laptop and bring it closer to you if you want. Got it.
 Oops. Or the forward arrow works too. There we go. So there's our project. You can see we're near our existing Wusted Hill treatment facility. The yellow dots on the map indicate where the Water Bureau will be acquiring permanent easements. As I mentioned, most of those easements are being revised within their existing limits. Okay. We're doing that because many of them are quite old. The Water Bureau has had facilities in this area for over 100 years and we've added new facilities incrementally over that time. One of the easements will be expanded by about 15 feet on either side. That makes room for new pipelines, construction and maintenance. And then on that map, the pink dot is a fee acquisition of about 1.66 acres of property. So it's particularly a strategic location for the Water Bureau. It's one of the few locations in our system where our conduits all run together. And then on the next page, I'll show you some next steps. This ordinance is the first step in a process. The next step in the process is for the Water Bureau to hire an appraiser. All of the interests that are the subject of this ordinance will be appraised. Each of the owners is invited to accompany our appraiser on an inspection of the property. The appraiser will prepare written reports that outline the value. The Water Bureau will make offers to each of the owners based on that appraisal. We will offer the appraised value. A period of time is established both by statute, and the Water Bureau allows additional time for negotiation to resolve problems with each of the owners. And then finally, this ordinance does authorize, or with your approval, will authorize, the Water Bureau to file with the county for eminent domain. But I would like to stress that that's a last resort. We have an excellent track record of negotiating with owners and reaching agreements. I believe that's it for the presentation. And I'm Teresa Elliott, Chief Engineer, and we're here to answer any questions. And colleagues, I just didn't have my talking points in the right place, so I wanted to stress that this is a process and what I've had ongoing discussions with the Transportation Department as well over the process of eminent domain. If Council hasn't authorised it, then maybe staff feels uncomfortable approaching property owners with a specific, here's how much we need because we haven't authorised it yet. On the other hand, this is the time that Council is authorising the project, and so it seems reasonable to me that property owners would be specifically notified that we're thinking of taking 73,000 square feet. And so I think that there are some further discussions to be had with the property owners. You just mentioned that that will happen. There's other issues in terms of how those negotiations happened, which thank you, Ben, for... discussing that. I learned when I was on the Planning Commission that in some cases property owners want to have the condemnation because of the tax benefits of that versus a straight sale and so that's called a friendly condemnation. That may or may not be, it sounds like over the past many years that hasn't happened very often because usually the terms are so favourable that even with paying the tax the condemnation is not necessary. Just wanted to let my colleagues know that I'm a little concerned about how we do things in general in the city, not just in the Water Bureau. And I want to make sure that the property owners have enough time to get their concerns and questions answered. This is a first reading of a non-emergency ordinance, so we may or may not bring it back next week, depending on how those conversations go. Thank you. And it's my understanding that some of the properties that you were discussing already have easements. Is that correct? In fact, all of these properties have existing Water Bureau easements. And again, those have been acquired over more than 100 years. And so those are the easements in most cases that we'll be updating later. We have a policy of bringing these old easements up to our current standard when we come across them with a capital improvement project such as this one. Okay thank you. And we heard earlier about the need for the lead corrosion control facility. Is there anywhere else that this facility could be put other than this and other than in this location? the improvements to the lusted hill facility that will include the corrosion control facilities the new facilities that we're building these are really in addition to or being added to our existing facilities that are already in place. So the answer, short answer to your question is no because they will be added to existing facilities. And they need to be in, and we're specifically connecting to the existing pipes at that location. Right. So no we couldn't put it somewhere else. No. Thank you. All right very good thank you. That Okay, we'll move on to public testimony. Carla, I understand there's a number of people who'd like to testify. Yes, we have four people signed up. Very good. Three minutes each, please name for the record. And the microphones move around about six inches away is good. Carla, we'll read your name. Okay, first three, please come on up. Our Lightning, Dee White, and Charles Bridgecrane Johnson. Ms. White, would you like to start, please? You want me to go first, Lightning? Or you want to go? Go on.
 Okay. I'll call you back. Fine. My name is Lightning. I represent Lightning Superhumanity. I always have a real problem with them in a domain, the government, stepping in on nuisance liens, foreclosures. So I have a problem with this. Now, if the private property owners are happy with it, fine. Have a happy day. But I don't think they are, and that's why we're at the table here to propose that in the event, and this is a real strategic move here on negotiating, in the event – you don't agree to our appraiser that we'll bring out to your property and our number that we provide to you, we'll go into Ammon Domain. So really, you might want to take our first offer and just understand if you don't, we're going to end up with your property anyway. Now, what's interesting here too is that you have easements on four of the properties and one you're purchasing. And I assume the one you're purchasing is the Lusted Road Farms property. Because when you're looking at the square footage analysis on these tracks, they're at about 72,000 unlisted. And then you have for another track, the Sandy River property, the DS track is 164,000. My position is that if you're going to do eminent domain in this area, forget the easements, purchase it, all the properties that everybody has. combine them all together, be equitable, be fair, and give them the market rate. Now, here's the problem that I have. Since you're going to be so hostile, which you are, you're just hostile to these people, I'm not only going to ask for market value, I'm going to ask for double the value because of your hostility on eminent domain. There's no reason to do eminent domain if I'm talking to you, Mayor Wheeler, and you're the owner, and I say, can we just buy your property? We're going to be doing a project here. We'll go under contract, and let's move this deal forward. You say, fine. But you're coming in hostile to me and to them, and you're saying, no, if you don't accept our offer, we go right to a court, we go right to a judge, we'll take your property because we're the big, bad government. We can foreclose on your property for nuisance liens. We can come in and do an eminent domain. And we don't care about your private property rights. Well, guess what? Appraisal value, double the price because of the way that you're being hostile on these negotiations. Double the price. I'm not happy with this. I'm not happy with this to move forward. And I vote no because of your hostility. Thank you. Good morning. My name is Dee. Can you all hear me? Yeah, it's good. It's good. My name is Dee White. I'm very much against your plans to take this property from these five parties in order to lay pipes for a $20 million treatment project that has a five-year lifespan. According to your plans, once your other $500 million treatment plan is in place, in 2027, plans are to close down entirely and abandon this treatment facility, including the pump station and the pipes. That's a five-year lifespan for this brand new facility, a pump station and pipes running through these properties. And all of these people's land will have been taken and torn up, new pipes laid. All of this will be shut down and abandoned. $20 million of ratepayer money wasted. How can you all possibly be justified taking a toll on these parties like this and doing this to these parties as well as the damage that you are doing to the greater public good? I'm going to read from a Portland Water Bureau status report on this project that was put out last July, a year ago. Portland Water Bureau is aware of the short-term life of the potential, of the short-term life of this current project, the cost impact of this facility, and the potential for stranded assets. So later on, so y'all are aware of it. Then it goes on to say that you're going to look and try to find some way to transfer the property and the new facility over to the treatment plant, to the filtration plant. And so then later, two months later, at a pub meeting, which is the oversight committee for the Water Bureau, which, by the way, half of them resigned last month because of perceived bias and conflict of interest. Anyway, at the pub meeting, another Water Bureau employee said, oh, well, that's… The only thing that's going to be available to move over is some storage components because many of the feed equipment is going to reach its end of life. So, again, you're going to be building this plant, laying these pipes, and closing it in five years. How in the world was this the best alternative given that the EPA three years ago directed the Water Bureau to immediately take action to reduce the lead using already existing infrastructure. That's infrastructure that's at Luston Hill that's already doing the corrosion control. Y'all had expanded it four or five years ago when you were trying to foist fluoride on everybody, and we voted it down, but you expanded it anyway. So it's there, it's available. And shockingly, even now, after three years of EPA telling you, you're still failing to deliver a safe water. Again, I'm against this taking of these parties for a temporary project that has a five-year lifespan. Thank you. Thank you. Good morning. Thank you, Ms. White. Obviously, Ms. D. White is the expert on lead here among all of us that are gathered to talk about this right now. With this project, there's on the connected 17-page PDF, which is mostly the maps of the properties that will be affected by sending pipes to this facility, which we hear is only going to have a five-year service life. And we need to really, I think, she mentioned Pub, we didn't get a chance to fully say Portland Utilities Board. And it's sad to hear about the resignations and staff changes there. Because it makes me think that we might actually need for a change the Cascade Policy Institute, which is usually wrong. But they should probably come and look at the overall running of the Portland Water Bureau. and compare the capital expenditures incurred by the Portland Water Bureau on a prorated basis with a public water utility in New York, a public water utility that has beautiful open reservoirs still functioning. So on this particular Lusted Hill facility, where is the outside advice that tells us a five-year, $20 million facility – is going to give us that slightly more alkaline water and that magically in five years we'll have gone into all the homes that have lead solder and fixed that problem. I don't know. It seems like there's... missing overarching guidance of how we're going to deliver safe water in the most cost-effective manner, which is one of the reasons that the water bureau in the city was sued before. I didn't particularly agree with all the aspects of that suit, but the city lost at least in part. And so, you know, it looks like ratepayers are going to have to look to other advocacy organizations, if not the Portland Utilities Board or Cascade Policy Institute, somebody else who's going to do an outside analysis of the habit that seems to be developing. You know, the water bureau moves around to different commissioners. But for a place that's dealing with water, it seems pretty easy that burning money there. So I hope that some outside watchdogs will possibly be able to co-sign that this is a good investment. Or explain to us why there are much better ways the Water Bureau can deliver safe drinking water without this expenditure and the impact on these property owners. Thank you. Very good. And Carla, was there one other individual? The last person who signed up is Cynthia Frazier. Very good. Thank you. Hello, I'm an attorney with Garvey Schubert Bayer in Portland, Oregon, and I'm representing Lusted Farms. I've been hired since Monday, so I'm getting up to speed, which is there's a lot to learn here. So in full disclosure, I did have a conversation this morning with city attorney Karen Monaghan, who's here. So I'm still learning. I presented a letter yesterday, which hopefully you have received today. And I'm giving you this, my background very briefly just so you understand that I'm approaching this from the pre-condemnation, pre-resolution standpoint. I was a Department of Justice attorney, that's how I started out doing exclusively condemnation. And I then in 2005 went to Garvish Hubert Beer where I now represent a lot of governments. And what I do for them is make sure they're following the Condemnation Procedures Act. That's primarily what I do. And then I do also do represent some property owners which is why I'm here today. So my big concern here is whether or not you're going to meet the legal test of least private injury and greatest public good with respect to my client, Lessard Farms. Based on what I've learned and been told, which is changing, he only received notice that his property was going to be taken on July 2nd, and that it would be at this hearing that there would be a resolution for eminent domain. He told me that he does not have any background information on whether or not this property is the only location for the 1.6 acres in fee. He does not know that. He has not seen any plans. He spoke with, and I actually spoke with yesterday, no excuse me, Monday afternoon, the agents that was actually going to be acquiring the property pursuant to the Condemnation Procedures Act didn't even know what was going to go on this property himself. It's apparently, you know, still in design, but it's like secret. So my concern is are we putting the horse and the cart in the wrong spot here? Has my client received adequate notice of what's going to happen out there? Has it been properly vetted that indeed this 1.66 acres is actually the correct spot for it to go? Otherwise, you're subjecting yourself as a legislative body to did you have enough informed decision to pass this resolution that indeed this location is the least private injury and the greatest public good. And that's what I'm asking you to do, to pause here, give my client an opportunity to get a little bit of information, for me to get a little bit more information, and for us to evaluate whether or not you're going to meet that legal test. So thank you. Thank you, Commissioner Fish. Did you have a question? No, my understanding is Commissioner Fritz said that following this hearing, she'd evaluate whether to bring this back next week or at some future time. It would be inappropriate for us to engage an attorney in a public forum on this question. She's made an argument. We need to get confidential legal advice and then decide how to proceed. But I think it would be inappropriate for us to engage the merits of that argument before we get legal advice. No, and I appreciate that. We're just looking for more information and I appreciate, you know, this is your agency and I've actually did work for the Water Bureau years ago on the big pipe project. I was involved in the relocation and some very complicated things. So I do understand both sides, but I'm requesting a pause here. So my client feels they have had full notice and opportunity to understand what's going there. I understand whether or not indeed this is the only location or it makes logical and I can explain to my client so that there is, I'm trying to stop the project right now. I'm just trying to understand it, get him to understand it and try to hopefully reach some type of a resolution so we do move forward with the normal Condemnation Procedures Act. And no one's ever happy when the property is taken by eminent domain. I know that. We all know that. And it's a process. Commissioner Fritz. Thank you. I'm feeling really fortunate that you were engaged for this property having had all of those different backgrounds and experiences and certainly I'm very willing to give you the time you need to talk with Karen Moynihan and the Water Bureau until you have a more time to understand, to get the facts of what's going on, what's not going on. So we'll look forward to talking with you and your clients over the next week at least. And if we need to extend it, I'm happy to do that. Well, I would greatly appreciate that. And I would appreciate a little bit more time than one week if I could possibly have it. Thank you. Or I guess let's leave it there. If you're satisfied with it, you can let me know. If not, we'll assume that it's going to go out a little bit further. Thank you. I've got to satisfy a client too. So that's always... All right. Thank you. I understand that. Thank you so much for being here. Very good. Thank you. Anything else on this? This is the first reading of the non-emergency ordinance. It moves to second reading. Next item, 694. We are going to move it, but if you could read it, please, Carla. 694, authorized exchange agreement with the USDA Forest Service to execute a land exchange in the Bull Run Watershed. Colleagues, land exchanges by ordinance require four votes in order to be authorized, and therefore we're going to move this to July 31st, where we'll have the appropriate number of commissioners present. Item number 695. amend city code to update oath of office requirements. Colleagues, this is a second reading. We've already had the presentation and public testimony, but it is also my understanding that there may be an amendment offered. The auditor's coming. Very good. Madam Auditor, come on up. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning Mayor and Commissioners. We have an amendment on this item at the request of Commissioner Hardesty and memo has been distributed to your offices and attached to the agenda and the amendment is striking the word private for private police officers and special as descriptors of the types of police officers who would be subject to the oath of office and So I move the amendment. Do we have a motion? Second. And a second. Commissioner Fritz moves. Commissioner Fish seconds. Just out of curiosity, I know that last week on the fly we didn't have the time to to be able to properly define those terms. Did we figure out, are these historical legacies or where did those definitions actually come from? Do we know at this point? We asked the police bureau and checked in with the city attorney's office about whether or not this would pose problems to strike that language. And they came back to us and said that it was no problem to strike him, so I'm assuming that they're just obsolete terms. This is very old code. Yeah, good. Okay, very good. We will take testimony on the amendment if there is anybody who wants to testify specifically to the amendment. Seeing none, please call the roll on the amendment. Fritz? I'm absolutely delighted that Commissioner Hardesty shares my delight in Reading all of the details and making sure that code amendments in particular, as well as other things, are accurate. And thank you to the auditor for being willing to accept the amendment. Aye.
 Fish.
 Aye.
 Wheeler.
 Aye. The amendment's adopted. Any further business before I move this? This is a first reading of a non-emergency ordinance. It moves to second reading as amended. Thank you, Madam Auditor. 696, please. amend Portland Policy Documents Code to update and clarify repository procedures. Also a second reading. Any further business, please call the roll. Fritz. So I asked for this to be pulled from the Consent Agenda while I was gone so that I could make some comments at the vote. And I certainly appreciate the auditor's desire to update and clarify the Portland Policy documents and how they get into code. There's a lot of outdated language in the current code. I am a little concerned in reading the amendments, which I agree clean up the old code, that that's not actually what we do for city council. And it hasn't been my understanding, for example, that even ordinances have to say whether or not they're binding city policy. And I know that for Commissioner Fish and me for the last 10 plus years, it's been a thing. It was my understanding that ordinances were binding, resolutions are not unless they say that they are binding. With the changes that are outlined in this, that are detailed in this revision, it says that all ordinances and resolutions have to say either it is binding policy or it's not binding policy. And I think that may result in some confusion for... a oedd yn cael eu cyflwyno yn y gorffennol gyda'r dealltwriaeth y byddai'n gweithio ar bolisi ac yn ymwneud â'r adolygiad hwn na fyddai oherwydd nad oeddent yn dweud eu bod yn gwneud hynny.

I think this revisions to the administrative appeals process has to stand out as one of the top five things that you've done. I think it's really great that you and the ombudsman recognize the challenges of people who want to appeal administrative decisions and made sure that they would be able to do that without great cost. And so I very much appreciate these changes. Thank you. Fish?
 Aye.
 Wheeler? A lot of detailed work, but I appreciate it as well. I vote aye. The ordinance is adopted. We're adjourned.
