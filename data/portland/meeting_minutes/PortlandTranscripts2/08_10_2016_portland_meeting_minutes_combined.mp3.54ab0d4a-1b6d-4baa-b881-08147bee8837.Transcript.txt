But I'm going to try and find a way.
 we will then take a couple of time certain items time certain means I'm sorry you'll take the consent calendar and then then we'll take a couple of times certain items time certain means no sooner than that time so we'll try to stick as closely to that as we can then we have our consent calendar and our regular counter as well are there anything is there anything to be removed from the consent calendar
 I don't believe so. And then we're going to reschedule one item from the regular agenda to the afternoon agenda. That is 937. So without objection, I'll do that.
 And if you're here to speak, welcome. We will take public testimony on the items where public testimony is appropriate. If you want to speak on a council calendar item, just let our clerk know and she'll give you an opportunity. We typically try to allow people three minutes to speak, and it looks like we might be able to accommodate that this morning. I know there's a student presentation here, so a lot of the people in the room are here for that.
 If you're here to speak on the council calendar item, you need to only give your name. You don't have to give your address. If you're representing an organization, you're required to let us know that, so please do. We follow the rules of decorum and common sense in this chamber, and that is if you want to show support for somebody's point of view, you're certainly welcome to give them a thumbs up or a wave of the hand. If you...
 happen to disagree with them and want to indicate your opposition, a negative hand gesture, a polite one is appropriate as well. But we ask that we not make vocal demonstrations or applause in favor or against our fellow citizens' points of view in this room. We make exceptions for students and visiting dignitaries, and I think we'll be doing that
 a moment so if you're one of those you might get a round of applause otherwise we try to keep it calm in here if you are just if you're disruptive in the council chambers or interrupt other people you'll be initially asked to leave and if you don't leave you'll be removed from the council chambers and excluded so we hope we don't have to do that and want to welcome everyone and we'll start with communications item number 917
 Request of Crystal Alinsky to address council regarding the city mafia connections. Ms. Alinsky, are you here? Okay. Let's move on to 918. Request of Kevin Martonic to address council regarding a resolution supporting the closure of Guantanamo. Mr. Martonic, come on up. Good morning. Thank you for the opportunity to speak to the council today.
 I'm an associate member of Veterans for Peace, but I'm going to work on this resolution that I have sent previously to the council just as a concerned citizen. The prison at Guantanamo was opened in January 2002 by George W. Bush through executive order without Congress's approval. Nearly 800 people were imprisoned there, including children. Additionally, Bush made a declaration that these captured people were not prisoners of war, denying them the rights of the Geneva Conventions.
 forcing the US into an era of illegal detention and torture. Very few, if any of those imprisoned at Guantanamo, have any charges against them. Convictions are often obtained through torture or bribery. More detainees have died at Guantanamo than have been convicted by military commissions. Of the remaining 76 prisoners, only a handful are actually being tried in military commissions. Nearly every case that's been won at Guantanamo has later been overturned in federal court.
 They've managed zero convictions that aren't guilty pleas in 15 years, not to mention the fact it also cost taxpayers $5.5 million per prisoner for 2015. That's $445 million a year to keep it open. As you know, our resolution in part supports the president's call to close Guantanamo. And it is modeled after those from other cities who have already passed such resolutions. Berkeley, California, Amherst, Massachusetts, and Levere, Massachusetts.
 It is in Portland's best interest to join these other cities who have already passed such resolutions because it falls in line with another resolution already passed by the city, Resolution No. 37172, reaching out to the Muslim, immigrant, and refugee communities.
 During the Muslim Educational Trust Community Center grand opening and at the City Council meeting on December 16, 2015, with the passage of Resolution 37172, the fact that the Japanese community was the first to reach out to the Muslim community after 9-11 was honored since the Japanese community knew persecution from their internment in this country in the 1940s. We have an opportunity to speak out against another internment, the Muslim internment that is taking place in Guantanamo,
 It may not be as large a number of people imprisoned, but though it is just as illegal, it is also worth considering what the next president will do with Guantanamo. Portland's reaching out to the Muslim, immigrant, and refugee communities is a great step in the right direction. However, for all of us to turn a blind eye to Guantanamo, where Muslims are illegally imprisoned and tortured, to let that slide without speaking out and standing up for human rights goes against our own values in every city of this country.
 This is one of many reasons why it is also an issue for every citizen in every city. Today, our country looks back on the World War II Japanese internment with regret. We are now living in similar circumstances with Guantanamo, where every citizen and every city can speak out against it by passing resolutions. To not do so is to allow history to repeat itself. Thank you. Thank you very much. We appreciate you shining a light on this. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Let's move on, please, to 919.
 Request of Megan Harrington-Wilson to address counsel regarding a resolution welcoming cleared Guantanamo detainees into Portland. Megan, come on up, please. Good morning. Thank you for having us today. My name is Megan Harrington-Wilson. I'm a volunteer with the local Amnesty International Chapter, Group 48. Amnesty International envisions a world in which every person enjoys all of the human rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
 These riots applied to an Iranian in prison for speaking out at a student demonstration. They applied to a baby born in a North Korean labor camp, and they applied to the men at Guantanamo Bay detention facility in Cuba. Most Amnesty International campaigns involve other countries, but at Guantanamo, human rights abuses are being committed by our own government in the name of our safety.
 I want to have a voice when my government violates international human rights law. Congress is not a vehicle for this human rights voice. Congress is speaking from a place of fear and ignorance. So I hope to find a less fearful voice locally here in Portland. This is a local issue for two reasons. One, we have seen time and again that national movement often only happens after states and municipalities show leadership. So as active citizenry, we must apply pressure where there is possibility of movement, and sometimes that's at the local level.
 Second, the difficulty of transferring detainees to third-party countries is cited as one of the major reasons that the facility can't be closed. But why would we ask other countries to take these detainees if we won't take that responsibility ourselves? There must be a brave, informed, local voice welcoming these cleared-for-transfer detainees who have never been charged with a crime. National security agencies have unanimously approved these transfers. Portland should follow the lead of Berkeley, California and the two cities in Massachusetts that have spoken with this voice.
 The Portland City Council made me proud with City Council Resolution 37172 passed in December, which expressed solidarity for Muslim, immigrant, and refugee communities. And I am proud to know that discussions are underway about the creation of a new Portlanders Policy Commission on par with the Human Rights Commission. To close, I just want to share a few words from a former detainee. Fahad Ghazi, a detainee from Yemen finally released from Guantanamo earlier this year, once said,
 I want to have the honor to speak out in my own voice and reach you directly, you who are thinking people. I want to say thank you for caring. You are willing to view me as a human being, and that is something so precious to me. So, to you thinking people, thank you for hearing us out today.
 Our proposed resolution is supported by Amnesty International USA, 9-11 Families for Peaceful Tomorrows, ACLU of Oregon, Americans United for Palestinian Human Rights, Portland Chapter, Oregon Physicians for Social Responsibility, Pacific Green Party, Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, Portland Chapter, Veterans for Peace, Local Chapter, and the Portland City Human Rights Commission. Thanks so much. Thank you very much. Thank you both. Okay. Let's take item number 920, please.
 Request of Rhonda Meadows to address council regarding an exchange between a city worker and an African-American homeless man. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning, Mayor Hales and city commissioners. My name is Rhonda Meadows. I have over 30 years of human resource management, and I've also founded two nonprofits in the city to support foster youth. I'm here to talk about, I'm here to speak about an incident my daughter and I witnessed in Old Town on May 14th.
 In this case, I'm speaking on behalf of an African-American man with a mental disability who cannot speak for himself. On May 14th, my daughter and I were walking in Old Town on Broadway and Davis. Much of the road was coned off. There was a lot of construction going on that day. So there were police officers, a lot of city employees working. As I walked on the curb with my daughter, we saw a city employee, a driver for a city truck, standing next to the passenger door, yelling in a very loud voice.
 I apologize for the profanity, but I'd like to convey the message as it was said. So I quote, if you come near my fucking truck again, I'll knock your head off. After witnessing this behavior, I walked up to the city employee and asked him his name. He would not tell me his name.
 I told him that I would take his license number and the phone number on the truck. I told the city employee that what he said to the man was very offensive to me and my daughter. And I was there to stand up for a man who could not stand up for himself. I stood five feet from a homeless man that said not one word while describing my discontent of the employee's behavior. Right as I was leaving, the employee said, I'm sorry you and your daughter had to hear that.
 What I wanted him to say was, I'm sorry for my behavior. On May 18th, I called the number on the truck to report verbal violence and profanity that I witnessed from the city employee to a homeless man who appeared to struggle with a mental disability. I spoke to a man named Jonah and described the behavior and told him I wanted to talk to his employee supervisor. On May 19th, Bill Clark called me, left me a voicemail stating that he'd received my complaint. I have Bill Clark's voicemail still on my phone.
 This is what Bill said to me on my voicemail. Somebody tried to jump into the city's truck, not sure what your complaint is. He had no choice but to get the person not to do that. I called Bill back and got no response. On May 20th, I called Peter Worszczyki, Bill's supervisor, and talked to Peter, told Peter about the incident.
 Peter called me back, told me to look into it. He called me back. And when he called me back, he said he did check with the employee about the incident. And he told me that the employee told him that the homeless man had a gun. And that was why he acted the way he did. I said to Peter, standing right next to the man, there was no gun. And I was a witness, as well as my daughter, to the incident.
 And I said, if he did have a gun, why didn't he call 911? And why wasn't there an investigation conducted as I am a witness of the situation? Again, there were police officers half a block away. The city in Old Town was full of construction. There were a lot of people around. I called Peter back. Peter never asked Peter to call me back. Peter never called me back. I called Laura Hansen, who works for Commissioner Novick.
 Talk to Laura about the situation. Laura never called me back. On June 16th, June 20th, and June 28th, I emailed Laura Hansen requesting a meeting with Commissioner Novick. No response. On July 5th, I sent another email saying how appalled I was that the commissioner did not respond to my request to meet with him. Thank you.
 I finally got an email back from Laura Hansen and Heidi Brown, the district attorney's office, stating that basically the situation was handled, it's confidential, that the city does care. She stated that the city conducts diversity and discrimination training. Mayor and city commissioners, this is not about diversity. This is about humanity. With all the violence in the world today, we need to hold our employees to a high standard. Thank you.
 a high standard of behavior. We need to teach and educate our employees about inclusion, about people with all classes, all disabilities, all abilities, all race, all gender. My question to you today is, Mayor and Commissioners, Bill Clark seems to think the verbal violence and abuse is acceptable to behavior, acceptable behavior in dealing with people with mental disabilities. I do not.
 I'm going to ask you to wrap up. I have one last question. What types of training are you providing city employees to understand inclusion,
 Thank you. I appreciate you doing this. And obviously, you know, we need to hear complaints directly, and that's one of the reasons why we do this. So thank you for doing that. Obviously, there will be follow-up to you. Thank you. Thank you. The other thing I just want to say is that I appreciate Commissioner Saltzman, who always takes my call and makes time for me to talk about our foster youth. So thank you, Commissioner. Thank you very much. Okay, I see Ms. Alinsky arrived, so come on up, Crystal. You've got time on the calendar day. Okay.
 9-17. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. A request of Crystal Alinsky to address council regarding our city mafia connections. Good morning. Good morning. Thank you so much, Mayor and councillors, for letting me speak. The commute is just getting worse and worse. But I brought you these. Basically, I'm just so sad that...
 I'm speaking on behalf of a person who's been coming to address you for years on some of these issues. And I'm shocked at the way that the public is treated. And people that I know that don't get special time behind closed doors, that don't get special appointments, people that actually speak out on other forums...
 okay, that wasn't me, are being harassed. And I think it's really the issue that's going on is nobody wants to admit that this city is not being run as a city. It's about campaigns, elections, lining pockets, living in a bubble, for one.
 I'm just frustrated that we don't seem to have any contact with each other. And the people I hear speaking the truth, maybe I'll hear them on, well, KBOO radio, sometimes even, think out loud. And I've just, I've been coming here for years. I don't understand why we're, we don't have a plan for our city on how to keep it sustainable. It's laughable that we keep putting LED titles on things like the elephant lands. And everybody knows that's a complete lie.
 hoax and taxpayer theft and torture of the animals. I don't understand why it's taken us since the 70s to raise... This one isn't even depositable, funnily enough. But we have BPA in our lining, and we can't seem to get Monsanto banned from our city, so we're going to have little side projects, pet projects that we do as commissioners and commissioner staff to make it seem like we're actually getting things done. In fact, we...
 continue to lower our standards in the 30-odd years that I've been living here. And pretending this is business as usual, I don't think you've read those books that I've mentioned, The Portland Confidential, et cetera. And it's probably time for us to not allow the status quo anymore. I understand you're all pretty much leaving. But when Ted Wheeler comes in and we continue to build Tyvek and particle board systems
 three-story condoms everywhere. I mean, remember when we stopped Walmart from the Burnside? We were talking about the traffic it would cause, and the couplet came, and it's just been chaos in the city. I'm appalled in that you would treat people like Joe Walsh the way you do, and Mary Ang, who's here today. And I'll say it again, but...
 We needed to have a moment of silence for those that have gone before us. Like Keaton Otis's father, we don't remember the things that they told our city to do, and we haven't done them, not since rain in the 1980s. Crystal, I need you to wrap up. Thank you. I'm just...
 Please get me my deposit back. I hear it's being raised to $0.10, but let's get all the plastic. I have plastic bottles here. And don't cover the reservoirs. You're getting sued over it. You're getting sued over the way you treat homeless people. It's embarrassing. Thank you. Thank you very much. Okay, we have one more citizen signed up to speak, and that's 921, please. Request of Jeff Cole to address council regarding Portland's historic and affordable assets at risk. Good morning.
 good morning commissioners mayor um after we've lost the lotus and a thousand other contributions will we at some point wake up to a rose that's lost its bloom a recent survey by the bureau of planning sustainability 7 000 portlanders responded the top two concerns of this survey demolition and affordability now it's clear enough opposition to demolition is support for preservation
 Opposition to demolition is support for preservation. This is no fiction. The Portland Way, what does that mean? Once we stopped a freeway through southeast Portland, and in doing so we halted the demolition of a thousand structures. Now, every 30 months, we demolish a thousand structures, many of vintage stock, stock of those who built Portland over a century ago. Let's take stock of that.
 Opposition to demolition is support of preservation. This is no fiction. Is the Portland way simply to imitate the Seattle way? Is Portland's Ballard district, is Seattle's Ballard district the gleaming model? Will Portland Ballardize our close-in vintage neighborhoods? Will Portland follow up and dismantle our mosaic of neighborhood associations?
 Is Portland's way today the Murray play? I just, of course, still the gist. Opposition to demolition is support for preservation. Recognizing this is no fiction, recognizing that new construction is never affordable in today's housing market. So today I submit a proposal that marries preservation and affordability. Community land trusts are the backbone of this effort.
 Community land trusts are the path towards permanent long-term affordable housing. Community land trusts can buy existing single-family homes, build new ADUs on these lots, and preserve them as affordable housing for decades to come. The details of this proposal are with you now. Not time to go into the specific details in this amount of time, but I urge you, let's do this.
 let's make this the next Portland way. Let's once again become the leader in planning. This is no fiction. Thank you. Thank you. I hope you do provide us with the details because we only have a couple of community land trusts in Portland and maybe we should have some more. Thank you very much.
 Okay, we want to thank those folks for being here this morning. We're going to move on shortly into the rest of our agenda, including the consent calendar. But first, I want to welcome a group of 15 high school students from across Africa. As I mentioned, we do welcome visiting dignitaries and students, and these folks are both. They're in Portland for a leadership exchange program on social entrepreneurship and volunteerism. I'll get that out. Their visit is sponsored by the United States Department.
 State Department's Pan-Africa Youth Leadership Program, which aims to develop a network of young adults with strong leadership skills, an understanding of participatory democracy, here we are, and a commitment to fostering mutual understanding between different ethnic, religious, and national groups. So would you please stand, students, and let's welcome them to Portland. Welcome to Portland. Thank you for coming. I hope you learn a few things while you're here, and then I hope you also tell us what you think that we can make better in Portland. So thank you for being leaders. Thanks for coming today.
 Okay, let's move to the consent calendar. Again, I don't think we have anything withdrawn from it, so let's take a vote, please, on the consent calendar as printed. Saltzman? Aye. Novick? No. Riggs? Aye. Fish? Aye. Hales? Aye. Okay, let's see. It is 945. Are we ready with the student presentation, Rachel? We are? Okay. So we'll move ahead, please, with item number 922. Okay.
 screening of student films from the media institute for social change summer program well good morning and welcome we're going to have a presentation here of student films i'm not sure who's kicking it off so come on up and let us know about your project and we're looking forward to seeing your work good morning council members my name is pilar curtis i'm from arlington virginia and will be a senior this fall at virginia commonwealth university
 This past April, I applied to the Media Institute for Social Change. As an aspiring journalist, I wanted to become a better storyteller. But the skill set I'll be leaving Portland with goes beyond storytelling. The 12 students in the summer program are passionate about social justice. And the Media Institute has given us the opportunity to make a social impact through our documentary films. We're screening two this morning, but all six documentaries are screening tonight at the Shout House in southeast Portland.
 The films cover a wide range of topics. One focuses on Portland's first female black cop. Another addresses income inequality as it follows a traveling jukebox. I'm proud of the work my peers and I have produced because each story is thought-provoking. Filmmakers who focus on issues of social justice can be changemakers. I don't think we're so different from lawmakers. You are elected to create laws that improve the lives of Portlanders. We want to create change as well, but through a different medium.
 I hope our documentaries on Portland-related issues will spark a conversation about the soul of the city and raise awareness about the needs of its people. Thank you. Thank you. Good morning. And my name is Dylan Walker. I am from a small town in southern Missouri, but I go to college at St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota. I'm a junior there, majoring in classics with concentrations in film studies and women's and gender studies. And I, along with Pilar Curtis, directed Please Play Me,
 the film you are about to see. On one level, Please Play Me tells the story of piano push play and the pianos that puts around Portland every summer. But on a deeper level, it also tells a story of the importance of arts access to Portlanders.
 Now, before we were making this film, I couldn't help but wonder how putting a piano on a street corner could cause social change. But then Pilar and I went to the streets. We spent hours talking to pianists. We talked to everyone from the founder of Piano Push Play herself to Commissioner Fish. And through all these interviews, we learned just how much art access means to Portlanders. And we hope that you remember this as you watch our film and also have a greater appreciation for the pianos in your backyard.
 thank you thank you good morning hello good morning thank you for meeting with us my name is trisha patterson i go to western washington university but i'm from camas washington my film is on
 the Daya Foundation, which is an adaptive yoga program in Southwest Portland. And my film partner, Rashad Salah, we followed this man named Arion Moore. He has a condition called scleroderma and it's a very serious degenerative disease. And the story, Arion's story is important to tell because it speaks to the strength and the perseverance that Arion has. And
 Maybe through telling his story, we can inspire others who have this type of condition or similar conditions to keep fighting and keep seeking help. And I think the film really speaks for itself, but I just thought I would preface it a little bit. Great. Thank you all for introducing these films, and I think Carla's got them queued up so we can all watch them. I don't have to press it right here? Okay, you do, apparently. Okay, there we go.
 It's probably a good thing I'm not healthy, because if I go back on the court, it's going to be bad for everybody. Like you'd get back and... Oh, I'd just dominate on the court. I grew up in East Palo Alto, California, which is a pretty rough neighborhood, but I was very grounded by my grandmother, so she didn't let me get in trouble. She was very strict. I was a pretty good student, straight A, because I did all the...
 The nerd stuff, they would have called it. Played sports a lot. Basketball became my main focus. And math, I loved math at the time. And then transferred to Southern Oregon University. Some gymnasiums, the fans would call me Snoop Dogg because he's tall and skinny and I would wear braids. So every time, like we played University of Oregon, and every time I touched the ball, the crowd would raise their arms and say, Snoop. And then whether I passed or shot it, they'd say, Dogg.
 A year after college, I got diagnosed with an autoimmune disease called scleroderma. Sclero means hardening and tightening. Derma means skin. So they call it that because that's when you recognize. That's when you can see something's wrong. Scleroderma.
 It's usually middle-aged women's disease is what they used to call it, but you're rare if you're male. You're rare if you're in your early 20s, which I was. And then if you're African-American or East Indian, those are like your higher mortality rates. And so as in hockey, it was the hat trick. The disease progressed to where I'm 6'6", and I dropped to 120 pounds. Had acid reflux, which makes it hard to eat. Vitiligo, which is pigment loss.
 Oh, and you can see with my hands, so the skin was tightening so much, they were balling into a fist. I remember, you know, the first symptoms was I couldn't palm a basketball anymore. I couldn't hold a cup of coffee. My friends would call me a ventriloquist. I mean, I was like this, couldn't move. And I can't raise my arms because the shoulders got too tight. Can't stretch, can't straighten my arms because they got too tight. I heard it.
 How we doing? 2012, I had a stem cell transplant. Now, a lot of patients have lung and heart, so they get better. But my problem was the joints had already contracted so bad. A lot of ligament, scar tissue, and tendon damage, which is not autoimmune, of course, so they can't reverse that. Two days later, Thanksgiving morning, that's when I first noticed my skin started loosening. And I was like, oh, snap, I can move my wrist.
 In June, I found the Dyer Foundation and wheelchair-based yoga since I can't stand up or get to the ground easily. And they've been very accommodating. They have someone set aside to help me with a lot of the poses because as you see with my limitations, I still can't beat some of the basics alone. They extended a scholarship, so that was great. They have a normal exercise.
 one of us will come up with an idea of how I can still get that same stretch. They'll just adapt to my limitations and my emotions. I know that he is a very hard-working man and very dedicated to trying to better his situation. He's got such an amazing spirit. You know, I'll reach out to people in the community and just say, hey, this is my story. I was here, I was an athlete, got a degree in criminology.
 I was working in the field and then I ended up in this situation. Now I'm trying to get back. No doctor can really tell me what to do because they've never seen it. I'm one of those people that you tell me something that as long as it's not a super high risk of death or injury, I'm in it. I've tried a lot of things. I can't foresee the future because I don't know what it is, but I do know I'll be back working.
 Every six or seven months, I need less help doing a lot of things. Every day I'm thinking about what I'm going to do next as far as a year or two from now, like when I'm going to get back to work. My whole 90% of the day I'm just thinking about getting better and getting back to work. The biggest thing with a disease that can disable you is being active.
 and the people around you don't even want to be around. They don't want to see no one deteriorating and not trying to get better. Arion, he's involved. He has that community of support and so maybe when some of
 his friends and associates see the benefits that he's been able to derive from coming here that maybe more people will come. I get to the point where maybe I can see Fritos from a weird angle, but I can still go out and play. Let's hear it for this great work. It's Please Play Me. I started tuning for Piano Push Play, I think if I remember right, it would have been about four years ago.
 At the time, there were only three pianos and I was only responsible for tuning one of them. And now there's 20 of them. Piano Push Play is a project where I rescue pianos and I put them out on the street for anybody to play. The only time you really see classical music, or lots of keyboard piano music, is in a concert hall, in a recital.
 in a piano store and I just wanted to bring that music to the street. I was stumbling along and I saw these beautiful pianos in strange places and the sign said go ahead and sit down and play and I thought wonderful you know since I can't carry one in my back pocket and I couldn't afford one it was nice to see them out and about the pianos. I think it's really important for people to have access because
 Like I've seen time and time again, there's so many more people out there that find something through playing this. And it's not just people that are trained classically. There's all kinds of people that sit down and really gracefully just play around and are obviously getting something from creating music with this instrument. Music is something that kind of really taps into the music.
 or release for people, I think. Oh, I think music is so important in your life. It just brings so much joy. It's a calmer, and it's a form of creativity, and it just, it's wonderful. Thank you.
 I think art and culture is part of our soul. I think it's part of what makes Portland special. And it's the reason why I think we have to always do more and not take it for granted. So if we believe that art is for the people, and if what we want to do is democratize the arts, then we have to make sure that there are a few barriers to experiencing art and culture. I'd feel sad if I didn't have these pianos to play.
 They mean an awful lot to me. I call them my girls. This is the third or fourth time this one in particular has gotten tuned because it gets used for so many different performances. It started in late June and goes into late August. It's about two months. So when the summer is over, a lot of the times
 people have reached out to me throughout the summer, once they've seen all these pianos and a lot of them wonder where do they go. And they go to a big variety of places
 When I started at ADX, Megan and Piano Push Play already had a piano in the space. And so I met Megan and she would come in and help with the piano tune, and we would have people come in off the streets and play the piano. Music provides access to music to people who otherwise might not have access to those types of equipment. The heart of ADX was to provide access to tools that people couldn't otherwise afford. Megan's done that with music through her piano, so it made sense as a synergy.
 Pianos take a lot of effort to maintain and they're complicated instruments to build and they're not cheap, they're not easy to move. And so a lot of people don't have access to pianos. Some of those people are people who play very well and don't have the resources to have a piano in their own personal life.
 And not only that, having a piano in the park, I found, brings a lot of people together who otherwise might not interact. I think what the pianos around Portland do is they...
 they raise our spirits. And I hope the idea takes off because who would have thunk it? You just put a piano in a public space and all this magic happens organically. I think all the aspects that make this project work are in every city. I know that there are kids that play piano in every city. There's artists everywhere. So, you know, I think this project can easily happen anywhere.
 Wow, excellent work.
 Thank you very much for bringing this to us today. So there's six films in particular about Portland in the project. They're all being shown at a screening tonight, right? Tonight at 7.30 at the Shout House in southeast Portland. So I want to make a request, Commissioner Fish, if we could do this, and that is I can't be there tonight, but I'd like to see the other four as well. Could we schedule one of those for each city council meeting over the next few weeks or otherwise bring them back here as well as get them out in the community? Because these two, if possible,
 They're wonderful, and I'd love to see the rest. So if we could enlighten this chamber with the rest of them, it would be a good thing. I'm sure we could, but a lot of the students are going back to wherever they came from. We definitely can. Okay. Yeah, we can screen them. It's just they won't be talking about it. My point is not just that.
 I want to indulge us, but I'd love to have a lot of people in Portland see them because those two are wonderful. Sure, yeah. Great work. Thank you. We'll work on that with the organization. And can I just clarify something? These are works of art. They're made by you, and there's a host organization. Do we have permission to put them on our website so that people can view them?
 Work on that, too? Bill says yes. We'll give appropriate credit, of course, but it's great work. And film really can move hearts and minds and tell stories, and obviously you're learning how to do that extremely well. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Let's hear it again for these students. Good work. Okay, we're going to have trouble equaling that in future council meetings. That was great work.
 All right, we're going to move on to the next sets of items, which includes item 923. And I want to, in a moment, get 923 and 924 read together. I understand we have 59 people signed up to speak on these items, and we also have some folks with disabilities and child care needs, so we're going to try to manage the testimony. I want to ask that people compress their comments to two minutes each instead of three, just so we can make sure we hear everybody. Okay.
 So be planning on that if you would, please. And then, Carla, why don't you read both items?
 923, authorized lease of Terminal 1 from the Bureau of Environmental Services to the Portland Housing Bureau for use as a temporary mass shelter. And 924, authorized application to Metro for an equitable housing planning and development grant in the amount of $100,000 to assist the Portland Housing Bureau in conducting pre-development work on the...
 the Terminal 1 site to determine feasibility of the Oregon Trail to Hope project. Commissioner Salzman. Thank you, Mayor. Today we'll be hearing two items regarding the proposed use of Terminal 1. The first is a lease agreement between the Bureau of Environmental Services and the Portland Housing Bureau for the Terminal 1 property, which would allow the Portland Housing Bureau to enter into a use agreement with Oregon Trail of Hope for use as a privately funded shelter.
 Secondly, we have before us a grant application to Metro for $100,000 to assist with the pre-development analysis to determine the feasibility of using this site for a homeless service center campus, as well as for transitional and affordable housing. Over the last year, this city council has taken tremendous strides to assist the homeless members of our community. We've strengthened our commitment to homeless services in a new partnership with Multnomah County,
 adding $20 million this year to our efforts. This council has also increased its commitment to what we all know is the long-term solution to this crisis, and that is more affordable and supportive housing. We've established a construction excise tax, dedicated transient lodging taxes from short-term rentals to constructing affordable housing. We've increased our urban renewal funds committed to affordable housing,
 and we've referred for voter approval an affordable housing bond measure for this November. When the city and the county originally created the Home for Everyone Coordinating Committee, we had aspirations of being able to engage the private sector in a meaningful way in helping to solve this humanitarian crisis of homelessness in our community. And today, we have that opportunity, that promise of commitment from a prominent local developer, Mr. Homer Williams. Thank you.
 Today we can take the first step toward achieving what I believe can be an opportunity to truly change the landscape in terms of getting people experiencing homelessness permanently housed by tapping into private sector resources. The use of Terminal 1 as a privately funded shelter is the start to that relationship. The resolution today provides the use of the site for a temporary shelter for up to six months –
 utilizing a vacant city-owned property. It will allow hundreds of people experiencing homelessness the option to sleep in safety and security, indoors, with access to bathrooms, showers, and facilities. In our work with the county, Multnomah County, through the Home for Everyone Coordinating Council, we have added 475 shelter options, but we still have more than 1,000 people literally sleeping on our streets and in our parks.
 And this temporary shelter would be in place by the time the weather changes. Winter is just around the corner. So it will allow more of our fellow Portlanders a safe, warm, and dry place to rest for the night. To speak on these items, we have one invited panel, and that is our Housing Bureau Director, Kurt Krieger. And we have Homer Williams and Don Maziotti of Oregon Trail of Hope.
 So if the three of you would come on up. Let's take the panel, and then I think Commissioner Fish has some comments. Well, I have some opening remarks, Mayor. So let's do that first. I have some amendments to put on the table, and then I invite a guest to follow. Okay, let's hear from council members, and then we'll take the panel. So go ahead, Commissioner Fish. Thank you very much, Mayor and colleagues. In 2014, the council declared Terminal 1 North surplus and directed the Bureau of Environmental Services to sell it
 for, quote, the best price, terms, and conditions available, end quote. Since then, staff have done a huge amount of work preparing lot adjustments, securing a broker, and getting the property to market. Today, Terminal 1 is open for bids, and we are in a very hot market. A 14-acre prime industrial site like T1 is scarce and is subject to very stringent protections. Now, the actions taken by the council to date should be good news for our ratepayers
 who are poised to benefit from the sale as the proceeds will be used to help stabilize rates. The resolution before us proposes to undo that work and then some. It is one of the many reasons I cannot support it. Supporters today will argue that the action proposed is not significant, that it only provides the developer with an option on the land so he can work out the details of the proposal.
 Frankly, in my eight years on the council, I can't recall any precedent for an action like this. And let's be clear, there is no plan, there is no funding, there has been no public process, and there has been no due diligence of either the proposed site or the plan. And yet we are poised to functionally approve a sole source development agreement on one of the most sought-after industrial sites in the city for a proposal that has been barely sketched out on the back of a cocktail napkin.
 So what's the harm? In my view, this proposed action will gamble with the health and safety of the most vulnerable people in our community, undercut the fragile trust we have built with our ratepayers, and risk future litigation, signal that the comprehensive plan is not worth the paper it's printed on, affirm that middle-income jobs in our community don't matter, and tell our community that a well-connected developer can march into City Hall, cut to the head of the line,
 and change the rules, no matter how sketchy the idea. Now, I'm not the only one who disagrees with this proposal. The idea has united a broad coalition of labor, environmentalists, editorial boards, business organizations and leaders, housing advocates, neighborhood leaders, and our independent oversight bodies, the Portland Utility Board and the Citizens Utility Board of Oregon. I have a colleague who's fond of matching council debates with show tunes.
 Today, the only reference I can think of is to the Broadway musical, Anything Goes. Mayor, I have a number of amendments that I would like placed on the table. And to those of you who are new to council, I am figuratively placing the amendments on the table. I am offering a package of amendments to both Commissioner Salzman's resolution and to his draft lease. I have circulated these amendments with my colleagues.
 They are interconnected, and it is my hope that they can be considered as a package. Mayor, I ask now that the package be placed on the table so that we can hear testimony on them. Okay, let's accept that as a motion and put them on the table as a package. There may be interest in unbundling them later, but let's take them as a package. Mayor, the amendments address a number of issues, and I'll just, in summary, I'll provide a shorthand so that people know what we're soliciting testimony on.
 The amendments address four issues, fair market rent, ratepayer liability, the terms of the lease, and notice requirements. First, the rent. We have a current valuation from a reputable commercial brokerage firm hired by the city to sell Terminal 1. We also have existing leases with commercial tenants who are paying more than $26,000 a month to occupy a portion of the site.
 Based on our calculations, the fair market rent for the full Terminal 1 site is $1.2 million a year. While Commissioner Saltzman's resolution does not specify which part of the site the Portland Housing Bureau intends to lease, if the proposal is for the warehouse and the fenced asphalt yard, we estimate the fair market annual rent at approximately $1 million.
 But because Dan and I have a significant disagreement about what is an appropriate rent to reimburse our ratepayers for this asset, and because it is illegal for ratepayers to subsidize a homeless shelter, I am proposing that the Office of Management and Finance engage a third-party professional to determine the fair market rent for whatever portion of the site Commissioner Saltzman or Homer Williams or whomever proposed to use.
 The second amendment concerns utility liability. While Commissioner Saltzman's resolution makes clear that he is attempting to hold ratepayers harmless for non-utility related activities, I propose that the city compensate BES from the general fund for all activities, including brokerage fees and other costs associated with the disposition of the property, should this council choose not to go forward with a sale. The lease term.
 I am proposing to clarify the relationship between the initial six-month lease term, any future proposed extensions, and the housing state of emergency, specifically that any lease extension beyond the initial six months return to Council so Council can hear a progress report and decide whether it is in the public interest to extend the lease. And finally, notices.
 I am proposing a relatively minor change to ensure that as the property owner, the Bureau of Environmental Services receives in a timely manner copies of all permits and approvals obtained for use of the premises by the Portland Housing Bureau or any third party. For example, Terminal 1 is located in a Superfund site and has been cleaned only to an industrial standard.
 I am therefore proposing that we require that the Housing Bureau or its assignees immediately notify the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality of the proposed change from industrial to residential use and copy the Bureau of Environmental Services on any correspondence about site changes needed to meet the residential public safety standard. And Mayor, after Commissioner Saltzman's panel, I've invited
 four people, a staffer from BES who is in charge of the property, a commercial broker who will testify in support of my amendment, and then as a courtesy, both the chairs of the pub and the cub have asked to present testimony. Thank you. Other questions or comments or amendments? I'd like to offer a further amendment to Commissioner Fish's amendment, a final be it resolved, be it further resolved that no general fund shall be spent on improvements or operations of the temporary shelter.
 I'll second that. Is there a second for that amendment? I'll second that. And then I have a question. By the way, I'll second that because Commissioner Salsman, in your opening remarks, you said this would be a privately funded facility, and I think we should clarify that. I have a clarifying question as to why the Portland Housing Bureau is doing this when we very recently said that the Joint Office was going to do all services for homeless people.
 The Housing Bureau is doing this because they are in the best position to be the lessee from the Bureau of Environmental Services rather than the Joint Office. Okay. Other questions before we turn to the panel?
 All right, thank you all. Mayor Hales, members of council, my name is Curt Krieger, director of the Portland Housing Bureau. And today with me is Jennifer Chang, who can speak to the subordinate issue of the construction excise tax grant application to Oregon Metro. I might add that the grant itself is superfluous if the lease is not approved with or without conditions by council today. So today Portland has an opportunity to change the status quo.
 with respect to safety on the streets for residents, for visitors, and for homeless people. Today, the City Council has an opportunity to work with socially responsible investors to help solve an intractable homeless problem afflicting Portland. This may be a moment in time, a singular opportunity. Portland's point-in-time count of homeless people in 2015 is over 1,000.
 found 1,887 unsheltered people. With some 521 year-round shelter beds available, we were able to serve 28% of our need. In comparison, using the same metrics and data sources, Seattle is serving 74% of the need, San Francisco serving 47% of the need. The unsheltered homeless of Portland and the real and persistent needs of over 1,800 people have driven the city and our shelter homeless partners
 many of which are legacy partners like JOIN, Central City Concern, Transition Projects, and Home Forward, to more than double the supply of permanent supportive housing and increase resources for rapid rehousing, all of which you approved as a council, from about 1,900 in 2008 to over 5,000 in 2016. Indeed, our sheltered population of vulnerable men, unsheltered population of men,
 of vulnerable men, women, and families would have been much greater, at least double over what it has been, had you not made those investments.
 The continuing commitment to do a better job of serving the homeless and increasing safety on the streets was the impetus behind the creation of the Joint Office of Homeless Services. Home for Everyone, the regional partnership to guide policy and programming for the homeless and people at risk, has set a goal to reduce the homeless by 50% in two years.
 The proposal before you today is a private initiative using largely private resources to help us meet that goal. Oregon Trail of Hope is audacious, it's ambitious, and their leaders are here today to help describe their vision, working in alignment with the city, the joint office, and community-based advocates and service providers to accomplish our goals. Indeed, their proposal will get us halfway to our goal in 2017.
 The resolution before you today authorizes a lease, which is the beginning of a long and arduous community engagement process. Following actions by the council, we'll work with the adjoining neighbors to alleviate safety and security concerns, with the joint office and selected service providers to establish levels of care and measurable outcomes for which the Bureau will continue to monitor.
 This is a temporary short-term lease which does not impair or diminish the city's long-term financial interest in the real property itself. Legitimate concerns about the fiduciary obligations of the city to utility ratepayers will be addressed.
 If an offer is made on the property without contingencies for the use of this site, that will establish the market value of the property. And I would submit to you that an offer without contingencies is the true market offer, not necessarily another appraisal coordinated through OMF. And frankly, I think you'll likely have an offer before an appraisal is complete. Zoning is not affected by the short-term leasehold interest. Long-term supply of land for industrial purposes –
 writ large in the comprehensive plan policy for no net loss, is unaffected by the short-term leasehold interest. And last, I would say that the environmental risk and exposure is unaffected by the lease because we're not disturbing the paved property, and DEQ has, to our satisfaction, indicated that the property is safe for residential habitation purposes. Thank you.
 We'd be happy to provide written documentation to that effect. I think people are going to want that, yeah. Absolutely. So following that framing issue, I'm available to answer questions through the duration, and I think following is Homer Williams. Okay, thank you very much. Good morning. Good morning, everybody. Let's put your name in the record, please. Oh, Homer Williams, Williams and Dame. Okay.
 Believe me, I'm as surprised to be here as probably you guys are. You know, this started a few months ago on a business trip. And, you know, I think I was introduced to something that, to me, was pretty remarkable. Now, I'm like a lot of guys and a lot of business people. You see somebody, you give them a little money, they go get some breakfast, and you feel like you've done a lot of good. What I've learned is...
 that is not a solution. It just makes you feel good. And what I also have learned, how much good work is being done by the city and county and how many good people are working in this field. I mean, it's remarkable. Unfortunately, the problem is bigger. It can't be solved and you guys should not have to try to solve it all yourself. Our homeless and
 It's our problem. It's a community problem. And I think that it's imperative, if we're going to make progress, that the public and private side need to both get involved. And so that's my commitment. I want to try to do that. In my business, it only starts with the land. You don't hire an architect, you don't make a plan, you don't do anything until you've got a piece of land and you know what you're going to build on it.
 In this case, in order to do what I think is necessary, we have to have a significant piece of property. It needs to be close to the city, and I think Terminal 1 fits that bill very well. Now, it may not be industrial jobs, but there will be jobs. But the important thing is that we all have to give a little bit, and that's...
 We need to take this next step. We need to see if we can involve who I think we can. I've talked to lots of people. We've raised several hundred thousand dollars of cash, in-kind gifts, the Holman Company, 400 lockers, somebody to buy the beds, Northwest Critical Care Group, Demand and Medical Facility, pro bono. So, you know, you break it down into pieces and you start chipping away at it.
 And that's what we propose to do. Thank you very much. Mr. Mazzotti? Mayor, council members, good morning. Thank you for allowing me to speak. For the record, my name is Don Mazzotti, and I'm here to urge the council to approve without amendment the two proposals put forward by Commissioner Saltzman on the subject of Terminal 1 and the use of that land and structure as a pilot shelter
 and service center to accommodate 400 houseless persons in Portland. I've been working with Homer, Dyke Dame, Matt Brown, and dozens of community organizations and leaders over the past five months seeking to develop the facilities necessary to accommodate 400 people of the more than 1,800 unsheltered persons in Portland tonight and into the winter.
 I have had the privilege of serving as Portland's Economic Development Director, as Chief Planner, Director of the Portland Development Commission. I mention this because during those many years of service, I was witness to the full range of challenges facing our community, as well as opportunities. And I can say without hesitation that the problem of houselessness and the very serious lack of affordable housing and the continuing rise in housing costs is by far significant.
 the greatest human and humanitarian crisis that our community has faced the proposals before you today will form three benchmarks for the city number one it will house and on a voluntary basis treat 400 unsheltered people who will become sheltered two it will make a major dent in the magnitude of the houselessness problem that we currently face as kurt has pointed out
 and it will provide the basis for our rediscovery of a public-private partnership of significant magnitude. And this last point is, I think, of great importance. Some of you are old enough to remember Louis Scherzer, Don Frisbee, Glenn Jackson, Dennis Lindsay, John Gray. These were people in the private sector who stepped up to challenges.
 who raised the money, committed the funds, and did the work necessary to do the great things that were done, have been done in Portland and laid the groundwork for an incredible place. When compared to the compelling necessity to house the houseless on a site immediately bordering the Pearl District, people who need our attention, self-enhancement, and the ability to regain empowerment and management of their lives seems to me should be our number one priority in the city.
 I entreat the council to adopt, in partnership with the county, a point of view which, to coin a phrase, is a city must be judged by the way it treats its houseless, those without homes, or the means to regain the dignity, health, and shelter that most of us enjoy.
 Thank you. Thank you all very much. Questions for this panel? I have a few questions, and I very much appreciate the presentation. I appreciate the motivation, but allow me to get into some of the details. Mr. Williams, the council directed me to sell Terminal 1 in the open market. We set up guidelines, and we have received offers.
 And as you know, I can't reveal those offers until the period for receiving offers ends. That's August 15th. But we will hear later from the commercial broker who's overseeing that process. And there's a very healthy market for this. And we are hopeful we can find a buyer willing to offer between $8 and $12 million. If Terminal 1, regardless of the zoning challenges, is the preferred location for the vision that you're pitching, why don't you play by the same rules everyone else is and make an offer on it?
 Well, first of all, the reason that we're even talking about a temporary facility is because of a current problem right now. And we're trying to do something on a very cost-effective basis. Okay. Well, sir, if you made a competitive offer and secured the position that you can use it for whatever purpose you seek, I'm just asking –
 Why have you not submitted a bid for the property if ultimately you believe this is the best location for the vision that you have brought forward? I find it interesting you say that since the reason that you don't want it is because of the jobs. So if you sell it to me, you don't get your jobs. In fairness, that's not my question. So you don't have to answer it, but it is currently for sale. Thank you.
 And you have not made an offer. That's correct. And you've made no effort to make an offer. That's correct. My next question is, in a story in today's Oregonian, if I read your quote correctly, you indicate that Wapato might be a suitable location. There's a question about its proximity to downtown, which I'm sure TriMet could cure with a bus to the max. But you make some reasonably positive statements about Wapato, which is, after all, a protected 26-acre area. Yes.
 and a building that, according to the story, the county is looking for a buyer and may be willing to accept a real bargain on the site. Have you considered making an offer on Wapato as an alternative location for the vision that you're bringing forward today? Well, first of all, I don't consider Wapato viable, so no. The answer to that is no. Okay.
 We have an amendment on the table that goes to the question of the city's investment in the shelter, the six-month shelter. Correct. Do you currently have a budget for that shelter? Once we have control of the property, okay? We've been working, but we have a lot of work still to do. Fair enough. And we'll have it shortly. Director Krieger, I have received a thick folder of...
 emails and letters from concerned citizens. And frankly, I don't remember the last time we had so much thoughtful communication on an issue. And we have a lot of people here today who want to testify. That's healthy. Whatever the outcome of this, it's healthy that we're engaging the community. There are three voices which are conspicuously missing from my packet. They are an opinion offered by Home for Everyone, which has an executive committee,
 the Joint Office for Homelessness, which we have tasked with actually overseeing our homeless services, and Chair Deborah Khafori, who has been taking the lead in our community on addressing homelessness and whose office the Joint Office resides. Do you have or will we today during this presentation get an official position from Chair Khafori, the Joint Office, or a home for everyone? I can't speak for the three. I would expect not.
 I would say this, that the goal has been set by the Home for Everyone Coordinating Board, of which the city has strong representation, and we are working in alignment with the Joint Office to satisfy that goal. There's nothing here that is inconsistent with their policy plans, and I would say that they have had an open and frank conversation with Mr. Williams and
 Brendan Finn, representing Commissioner Salzman's office, about how this intersects with their plans and procedures. I can also say that in my experience with the Oregon Trail for Hope consultant as they were scoping this project out, I said there were two quid pro quos for me as the Housing Bureau Director. Okay.
 I think it's important to tell you what those are. One, I said this can't come at the expense of any other existing shelter program or operator. We have a series of carefully woven service providers, some of whom have been providing that service for over 20 years in this town, and this needs to be a value add over and above that level of service.
 And secondly, having worked in cities with large multi-service centers, such as Phoenix, which has a human service campus near the state capitol, they co-mingle families with single people in those facilities, as does San Antonio, and I said that
 that it would be my considered recommendation not to do that, that to serve families in a separate location so that the issues of onsite management and service provision are better managed. So I think the Home for Everyone Coordinating Board is getting their –
 around this concept. And I think with those caveats, that this is not coming at the expense of any existing program, that they will ultimately get to a position of supporting this. One last question, gentlemen.
 I put forth this morning a relatively benign package of amendments, and I was struck that already from this panel we have such vigorous disagreement about those amendments. I just want to, on the one principled issue upon which this council cannot bend, which is the fair market rent for this transaction, since it is illegal for ratepayers to subsidize this enterprise, I just want to make sure I understand your position. Mr. Mazzotti?
 Your testimony is that there should be – we should move forward today without amending. My amendment simply states that we need to have a third party determine what is the fair market value. What is your objection to that, sir? Well, first of all, this is not a for-profit venture.
 This is a venture to provide assistance. Mr. Mazzetti, what's your objection to having a third party established fair market rent? My objection is that we're not looking at the rental market and for-profit valuation terms. We're looking at it in order to provide a facility that would serve 400 houseless people in the short run. So let me just pursue that.
 We have existing tenants on the site who are paying commercially reasonable rents. Do you believe we should offer the site to you at less than the existing commercial tenants, yes or no? I'm sorry, I didn't get the whole question. That's because Mr. Williams was talking to you while I posed it. So let me ask it again. Let me ask it again. No, let me ask this. He has testified, Dan. I'm going to ask the private party who has come forward to run this.
 You have said in your testimony that we should adopt the resolution without amendment. That is correct. My amendment says we should establish the fair market rent, and you can do that a number of ways. We'll hear from the broker later. You can look at the existing tenants who are paying us rent, and you can claim that that is a fair market rent because that's what they're willing to pay.
 You can make up a number, or we can ask a professional to give us a range of what is the fair market rent. Is it your testimony that we should not attempt to have a neutral provide the fair market rent for this property? It's my position that this is not a for-profit venture. Thank you.
 that market rent is not relevant when we're talking about public interest and public use. This is in public ownership and for a higher and better purpose. Folks, don't pause, please. Folks, you may not have been here earlier, but I ask that you make thumbs up or thumbs down gestures, but the pause interrupts the process. I'm not going to have a lengthy discussion about that on the record because I've spent the last three years defending a lawsuit against the city on this, and I don't have the luxury of being cavalier about that question.
 Kurt, to you, do you have an objection to a third-party professional with some agreed-upon criteria to set the fair market rent? My experience with appraisals, especially for –
 unique, one-of-a-kind properties is that they are one opinion of value. And it would be an interesting exercise to go through. To me, the more relevant point, and I tried to frame it earlier, is that if you have an offer without contingencies for cash sale of the property, that will set your value, and that will likely be disclosed or available for public disclosure before an appraisal can be conductive.
 If you have, consequently, a lease without contingencies that is able to be disclosed publicly before an appraisal is done, that will establish a counterpoint value. So these are all bits of information that provide the counsel with a considered judgment. To me, the lease term is less important than the principal.
 Either you embrace the principle or you don't. The lease can be worked out. The use of the property, albeit temporary, can be in place while a sale is consummated because the likely use of people
 People buy buildings all the time with tenants in place, and this would likely be a condition similar to that. What I will do when the commercial broker comes up in a little bit is I'll ask him to walk us through the existing leases because we have existing leases with commercial tenants. And my view, and I don't think this is debatable, is that if we have to evict those tenants for another purpose,
 We can't accept less than they were offering for the property. Otherwise, by definition, the ratepayers will be subsidizing this activity. We'll debate that later. Thank you. So the termination of the proposed rent of $10,000 a month is based upon what this council approved earlier this year for Nike to lease the very same property for Tracktown USA. Okay.
 So that's, to me, a point-in-time determinant of the appropriate value, and that's what we're proposing to pay. And let's be clear on that, and I'm glad, Dan, you raised that. Before this property was placed on the market, this council determined on an interim basis that we should allow Nike to store a track there. And the city, that is through the mayor's office and the Bureau of Environmental Services, charged a fee commensurate with our costs, offsetting our staff costs.
 because legally, since it wasn't on the market and it wasn't for sale, our legal advice was all we had to do was recoup our costs. Subsequently, we put the property on the market. We now have offers, and there has been a market price established. They are apples and oranges, and I think if this process was done in a collaborative way in which bureaus actually talk to each other, this could have been resolved a long time ago. I'm offering an amendment that
 because in my view it would be illegal to offer a less than market rate to a private entity. And since I am the party who is charged with defending the city in a long-running lawsuit, I would expect that my colleagues would view that position sympathetically.
 Okay, further questions for this panel? Yes. First of all, Mr. Williams, I really appreciate your increased dedication to helping with the problem of homelessness. I remember September of 2013, well, we had a hearing in this chamber proposing to move Right to Dream 2 to Lot 7, and you and your company gave money so that we could find another place, and I appreciate that.
 My question is to the Housing Bureau. When we both brought the Lot 7 question to Council and when we then brought the...
 request to purchase a property on the east side for Right to Dream 2. In both of those cases, I had a zoning confirmation letter from the Bureau of Development Services indicating that the zoning was appropriate and that the use would be allowed. Have you asked for a zoning confirmation or any kind of input from development services to know whether this is even allowed? No.
 We've not sought a confirmation of zoning. The legal construct for this is the state of emergency. This is a six-month lease, a temporary utilization of the property. So we're not impairing the zoning whatsoever. So.
 So when we passed the emergency declaration, we did waive their zoning code, except for 33-296-040, which is the temporary activities part of the zoning code, and that forbids any permanent improvements for a temporary activity. So does this building currently have lighting, heating, bathroom facilities? There will be no permanent improvements made under this occupancy. All the improvements will be temporary.
 How are you proposing to heat it? There will be temporary, probably propane heating plant. There will be sanitary facilities, also temporary. There will be washing facilities, also temporary. There's going to be no disturbance of the soil or the paved surface, the property, because of DEQ's underlying concerns about the soil. Is it paved now? No.
 The portion that we are leasing is paved, yes. And so you're proposing to service 400 people with porta-potties and portable showers? I think it will be more elaborate than that. But this can be done without difficulty and not be a permanent installed plumbing, electrical, and heating system. Thank you. So my final question is to Commissioner Saltzman. Last week I suggested a property that we had looked for.
 at for Right to Dream 2, that would be less rent, that the zoning would allow for a mass shelter? Did you look into that? Yes, we did. And all I can say is that the proposal before you today is the proposal that I'm supporting. I think we're going to hear a lot of testimony about looking elsewhere. It's easy to look elsewhere. And that process can, in fact, be endless, as the city has done.
 examined and scrutinized its own inventory of properties. The Portland Business Alliance has scrutinized the private sector inventory of properties, and we have not found anything that is as suitable as Terminal 1. Can I add a comment to that, Commissioner? Mayor, when you – Folks, I'm sorry. Interruptions are not allowed. We do ask that you respect both the folks in the room who want to participate in this process and people up here by not interrupting. Go ahead, Commissioner. Thank you, Commissioner.
 Mayor, I take very seriously the charge that in the area of addressing our housing crisis, collectively, our goal is not to get to no, but is to get to yes. And, in fact, I'm proud of the fact this council has consistently done some innovative things, added new funding, and I'm proud to partner with Dan on many of the things he highlighted. I will say, though, that at least at the Bureau of Environmental Services, we are unaware of any process to identify –
 any alternative location. And the one time, Mayor, we were asked by your office to identify a potential site for a short-term use. As you know, Director Jordan and I went out and found a place, and we are now working with your office. So perhaps I understand Commissioner Saltzman's view that he thinks this is an appropriate site. I will just say that I'm unaware of any process to look at public or privately owned sites that might be appropriate,
 And so to sort of suggest that it's all or nothing here, I think, is a little misleading if the city has not even undertaken a comprehensive analysis of land that can be either publicly owned or privately owned. And I'm aware of no barrier to us doing that other than a desire to tie this property up to do our due diligence after the fact. And if this resolution fails or if it turns out in the next month –
 based on information done through minimal due diligence, that it is not an appropriate site, I would hope the commissioner will come back to the council and ask us to authorize a process to look for an appropriate site. We have at least two years to find that site because that's what Mr. Williams has said it's going to take to line up a plan and funding and other things. So let's not act like today is the only day we can address this. To my knowledge, we haven't even undertaken that process. And by the way,
 In that process, I would hope that homeless people are at the table guiding the decision-making because I have yet to hear from a single person in the community who has said that they intend to move from outer southeast along a natural area to an unsafe industrial district for purposes of temporary shelter. And I hope we engage people in that conversation. Okay. Other questions? Yes.
 Yes. Director Krieger, one of the objections that I've heard to this proposal is that many of the opponents are very skeptical that Mr. Williams or anybody else will actually be able to mobilize the resources to operate even a temporary shelter. It's my understanding that actually…
 after this lease is approved, if it is approved, then you will be engaging in discussions with Mr. Williams and partners to verify that, in fact, those resources can be brought to bear. And if you conclude that Mr. Williams actually is not in a position to mobilize the resources to operate a shelter, then we can simply tear the lease up because, after all, it's a lease from one city bureau to another. Is that correct? That is correct. Thank you.
 Okay. Other questions? Thank you very much. We obviously may have later questions if you're still here and available, but let's move to the next panel, please, and then we'll take public testimony. So, Commissioner Fish, you have some particular folks you want to bring forward? Yes, Mayor. Give me one sec. I'll get my sheet. Mayor and colleagues, I've invited four people. First, Kendra Smith and Janice Thompson. Kendra
 And Alan Worman. Alan and Kendra are co-chairs of the Portland Utility Board. We welcome you. And Janice Thompson is our liaison to the Citizens Utility Board of Oregon. Thank you all for joining us. There may or may not be another chair available if you want to pull up a fourth one, but if not, we can take these people in turn. We'll do this panel, and then we have one other panel. We do have a spare chair. Okay, there we go. So...
 Kendra will recognize you first. Thank you, Commissioners. We'd like to thank you. My name is Kendra Smith, and I'm one of the co-chairs of the pub. We'd like to thank you for giving us the opportunity to weigh in on your debate regarding the disposition and possible lease of the Terminal 1 North property currently owned by BES. Thank you.
 The pub has submitted a letter that articulates our recommendations regarding the timing and decision-making process surrounding the potential repurposing of this property. As you're aware, the Portland Utility Board was formed to advise City Council and the City's utilities regarding delivery of service, use of funds, and to rebuild the public's trust.
 Unfortunately, the manner in which this resolution was brought forward represents an old way of doing business that the pub was commissioned to help avoid. We welcome the opportunity in the future to serve and advise the council regarding the use of utility assets before they reach this level of public debate.
 BES followed proper disposition procedures for Terminal 1 North and is actively accepting bids that will help the city to determine the property's fair market value in the next five days. This information will allow the city to evaluate bids and make an informed decision regarding the fair compensation to BES regardless of its decision to sell or lease the property.
 the pub therefore recommends the city council delay any decision regarding this resolution until there's an opportunity to review the bids after august 15th furthermore the delay would provide the city the opportunity to address other concerns we articulated in the letter
 including documentation of the market-driven lease rate that fully compensates the utility for the use of the property, documentation regarding lease terms, risks and liabilities, and insurance, should the city decide to enter into a lease rather than complete the sale process.
 and to do adequate due diligence of the proposed use and potential conflicts with the zoning code, the comprehensive plan, the industrial land supply, infrastructure and site improvements required, and the opportunity costs associated with an alternative use and contingency planning.
 The Pub welcomes the opportunity to review such information and, with public input, offer further advice to the Council. It's critical to avoid any perceived or real conflict in the use of utility funds for city activities unrelated to the provisioning of utility services. Thank you. Good morning. Janice Thompson, Citizens Utility Board of Oregon.
 Excuse me one sec. I think Alan has something to add. Excellent. My apologies. Commissioner, I'm Alan Worman, co-chair of the pub. We really appreciate this issue that we have before us. This land is the wrong tool for addressing this issue.
 This land redirecting, repurposing is very similar to the Water Bureau. Funds that were spent on the water house and on the Rose Festival facility on NATO Parkway. Also, this turmoil that we see to be in is decreasing the market value of this property. And it also impacts Portland as a reliable seller of property that's unused. Anyway, thank you. Okay. Janice Thompson, Citizens Utility Board of Oregon.
 So first point is CUB does not support the proposed $10,000 monthly rental. It does support the amendment to obtain an independent evaluation of the fair market value. I concur with Commissioner Fish's apples to oranges characterization of trying to compare the $10,000 with a fair market value.
 Also, CUP supports the proposed amendment regarding reimbursement of the Bureau's Superfund related to the costs incurred in marketing the site. This is, I think, a bigger picture angle to this is that
 not only does this proposal kind of undermine future use of the surplus property policy by BES, but also of the use of that policy by any city bureau. So I think, you know,
 there's a bigger picture angle here to consider. Now, CUB would support postponing today's proposed actions until after the completion of the bid process, but it really does seem like there has been damage already done with, and again, specific damage to BES rate payers, but also bigger picture damage relationships with brokers, and so forth.
 the increased likelihood of skepticism and possibly lower bids from any future surplus city property proceedings. So we definitely recognize that the role of the Housing Emergency Declaration to allow actions that are a reversal of previous actions, it really does seem like this is a case where that authority is being used more
 to overturn pretty significant previous council actions. And I think we would be concerned about those proposed changes kind of negatively affecting the rates, the interest of BES rate payers, even if due diligence steps had been taken. But I think what's particularly troubling here are these steps are being proposed with minimal, very minimal due diligence.
 And I think that's worth highlighting, particularly in this environment where legal action has already been taken regarding the use of ratepayer dollars.
 So to summarize, I firmly believe that the $10,000 rent is not acceptable. CUP supports the other proposed amendments, but more broadly is very much concerned about the impacts on BES rate payers, particularly given the lack of due diligence on the proposals before you.
 So did the CUB testify in opposition to the lease to Nike, or Nike's lease of Terminal 1, for $10,000 a month? I actually looked at that and did not, because my understanding was that it was a temporary item that was only an option because the sale process was going on. In other words, it was a situation where...
 It wasn't actively released. Okay, so you didn't testify. Did the Portland Utility Board take the position? No, because of, let me finish, because we didn't see it in a problematic way and agree with Commissioner Fish's characterization of like it's an apples and oranges situation. Since the question is to me.
 And I can describe the conversation I had with the mayor. We had no intention of leasing the space to any party. We were about to put it on the market and actually had qualms about using the space. But because we had no intention of offering it to anybody, and therefore there was no commercial market for it, we agreed that for a two- or three-month period we would simply recover our costs so that BES would be held harmless, and,
 but would not treat it as a commercial lease since we were opposed to leasing it and it was simply a convenience to a third party. Once the property was put on the market and once the market established the price, then that set what the fair market price is, and they are apples and oranges. So, no, I did not testify. That's why. Any questions? Thank you all very much. Did you have someone else, Commissioner? Yes, Mayor. Thank you all very much. You're welcome. Thank you. Okay.
 And the final group is Eli Callison, who is the property manager for the Bureau of Environmental Services, and Scott McLean, who is our broker from Colliers International, formerly known as? Norris, Texas. Norris, Texas. Gentlemen, thank you. Eli, there's a lot of people waiting to testify. So I'm going to ask you a very simple question. Could you just briefly describe the current state of the site? Sure.
 and the existing leases on the property. All right. As mentioned before, the site's 14 1⁄2 acres. We have two leases currently active on the property. One is for 50,000 square feet of the building. We're getting $0.30 a square foot per month for that. They're also leasing a portion of the yard and paying $0.10 a square foot for the yard. So from that lease, we're making $19,000 a month.
 The second lease is strictly for yard space, 7,000 square feet, 10 cents a square foot. So we're getting 7,000 for that per month. So the total rent we're getting is 26,000 per month. And what percentage of the site is currently being leased? I don't have the exact number, but I would guess somewhere around a quarter. Quarter of the site? Quarter of the site. Okay. And just to clarify that, well, actually, we'll leave it at that. Mr. McLean, thank you for being here.
 You are the professional broker who has been advising the city on the sale. Could you briefly tell us the status of the sale process? Yes. We put it on the market 45 days ago, got the information out to the community, and then started the process of touring groups through the property. We've toured approximately 18 groups through the site. Of those, I'm guessing about 14 will write offers or at least have said that they're interested to the point of writing offers. Okay.
 This process that we're going through right now has slowed that down a little bit. We received a letter yesterday from a buyer that said that they're going to wait and see how this process finishes up before they're going to submit an offer. They didn't want to get involved in this discussion. The buyers range from – there's really two categories. There's users and then there's developers. The users groups includes local breweries who want to expand customers.
 There's a greenhouse use that's non-cannabis that's looking at trying to bring organic farming kind of back to the city. There are large wholesale distribution warehouse uses. There's a movie and video production group that's very interested in the site. There are tile showrooms and showroom uses that are interested in taking advantage of the showroom uses that are expanding in northwest Portland. There are...
 About six developers that are very interested in the sites, their uses range from artist space, maker spaces. One developer wants to build what's called incubator space for small businesses. There's really a very strong shortage of demand of small 5,000-square-foot-type spaces anywhere in the city. Developers are looking at making creative industrial space, kind of like what you're seeing in the Central East Side, where you're seeing advertising and other creative-type companies expanding.
 So those are the developers that are looking at it. The process was going very well. We've got lots of interest, and we were expecting to get quite a few offers on the 15th. We still will see some offers, but I think the process has been hampered a little bit, waiting to see what happens here today. Thank you. Last question. The broker has a question. Hey, no, Charles. Charles, no. Charles, you're going to be excluded. You can't interrupt. Stop, please. Go ahead, Commissioner. Thank you, Commissioner.
 Mr. McLean, we have asked you before what you think the fair market rent for this space is. Could you tell the Council if you've made a determination and what the basis of your opinion is?
 Yes, I did make a determination. And I think it's important to know that right now, Portland is at historic low vacancy rates. Collier's, who I'm working for now, has never seen vacancy rates as low as they currently are in the Portland area. So that's caused lease rates to increase pretty dramatically and really put a squeeze on space. So right now, the warehouse space, it's important to understand, it's an unheated warehouse shell.
 If it were heated, it would be leasing for about $0.50 to $0.55 a square foot. We're using a lease rate of $0.35 a square foot. We're currently getting $0.30 from the tenant who's occupying it now. So conservatively, $0.35 is what I use for the warehouse shell. It's 96,000 square feet.
 The yard space, which, and when you lease warehouse space, you typically allow the tenant to have some outdoor yard area with it so that their building is not just on its footprint. It has some outdoor space. So of the 14.5 acres, we've attributed 14 acres to the warehouse that you would get as part of your lease rate. Four acres. Sorry, 4.5 acres. Excuse me. Thanks. 4.5 acres to the warehouse. The remaining 10 acres, we've used the market lease rate of 10 cents a square foot, which is $1.
 I think probably conservative for fenced, paved yard area as well located as this site is. We could lease that space immediately.
 over and over again but we've turned away quite a few tenants who wanted to do long-term leases which didn't fit with our goal of selling the property the other two the other two components that make up the site are the dock area which is about three acres there are some load capacity limits on that so i used five cents a square foot for that and then the perimeter of the dock which is 1600 linear feet we used a 10 10 a square foot per month on the linear dock area to more ships
 Under your current agreement with the city, are you being paid a commission or an hourly rate? I am going to be paid a flat fee upon the sale of the property. And the flat fee doesn't turn on the ultimate price? It does not. And that was for the benefit of our friend. And I want to be clear, sir. We retained your services to find a buyer. You have performed admirably. We are still hopeful we get offers on the 15th. We did hear from a buyer yesterday. Okay.
 that has pulled back because of the uncertainty about the ownership of the space. And I have two amendments that would impact you. One is to ensure that your fee is compensated out of the general fund, because if we're not allowed to proceed with the sale, then the entire process serves no ratepayer interest. And second, I have proposed that we use a third party to establish a
 the fair market rent, and that's because Commissioner Saltzman has put a number on the table. You as the professional broker have put a number on the table. And normally in these circumstances, rather than argue numbers, we ask someone who is independent of the entire process to give us an opinion, and that's what my amendment would do. Thank you.
 Okay, I've got some questions. This may have been covered and I may have missed it. I was out of the council chambers for a moment. But it's context that I think we need to think about the real estate part of this piece, and that is when did the city buy this property and for how much? The city bought the property in 2006 for $6.5 million. Okay. And how many times have we leased it?
 Since we got, because we bought it for the combined sewer overflow project. We bought it for the combined sewer overflow. We worked on the property ourselves because we had to be there. That's why we bought it. And then it became surplus when the project was done, right? That's correct. At this point. It didn't become surplus until.
 until the council directed it was surplus. Well, okay, I'm sorry. It became unused when we got that. No, it only became – that's an important term. Yeah. You used surplus. Yeah, I get it. I understand the distinction. 2014 was when the council declared it to be surplus and directed it be sold for the best available price. I understand that. But how many times have we leased it and for how much? At this point, I would say we leased it about three times. We've gotten –
 Two leases for the yard at 10 cents a square foot, one lease for the building at 30 cents a square foot. That was the world indoor track and field Nike thing? No, and then there was track town as a separate action. Okay.
 So aside from the lease questions, maybe let me ask the broker this question more directly. I think it's sort of an obvious question that a lot of us are weighing here, and that is I've been involved in Portland real estate as a homeowner since, I think, 1980 when I bought my first house, a fixer-upper at 31st and Irving for $60,000. Okay.
 Like a lot of people, I have some real estate regrets, mostly about selling that house in order to buy another one instead of somehow figuring out how to hang on to it. But we couldn't because we couldn't afford to do that. All of my real estate regrets involve property I didn't buy or property that I sold. Given what's going on in Portland real estate, would you expect this property to continue to rise aggressively in value over the next, say, year?
 I think Portland real estate will continue to rise in value. We don't know what interest rates are going to do. We don't know what the overall economy is going to do. We're starting to see some overbuilding on apartments, but I think in general the industrial market will remain strong. Are you advising clients that they're likely to pay significantly more next year for properties that they're looking at today? Probably conversely. We think we're in a top-of-the-market type situation. Really? Yeah. So you expect property values to level out?
 We don't expect them to increase as dramatically as they have over the last couple of years. Okay, thank you. Other questions?
 thank you both very much thank you gentlemen okay i think we are finally at the point where we can turn to public testimony and i want to offer some um mercy to folks with disabilities or small children who are here so if we could show that courtesy and take those folks first and then we'll take the rest of the list um hello good day my name is mary eng and i suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder from an abduction and assault
 I thank you very kindly for not hurting me or bruising my wrists or my arms or compressing my wrist joints in pain manipulation like you did a few weeks ago.
 I want to say thank you to Nick Fish for his courageous work bringing up Anything Goes. It was one of my favorite musicals, and I will humbly offer to sing Anything Goes, and I... No, no, that's secondhand rose. Hold on. In olden days, a glimpse of stocking was... But, you know, I really don't want to go there, but if we could get a stage show, get a real sort of off-Broadway thing, a terminal one, I think it needs a more jazzy name, because it sounds like a...
 Konzentrationslager, mein Herr, und ich hatte deine Herrkrüge Freund gemacht, Herr. Es ist allein ein problematischer Problem. No, he's not really a Nazi. No, he's not. It was just a misunderstanding with that Jewish Oregonian reporter. And Mary Claire Buckley and I have held hands and the co-op's going to be all right today.
 And the homeless are going to be all right too. And nobody's going to die of hypothermia this winter. And no one's going to plant anything in my bag like a corkscrew, John Chandler. John Chandler, where are you? Where are you? No, I'd never had a corkscrew and I don't drink.
 At 9.30 a.m., Charlie Hales, I don't know about you, but we have asked you to resign and we shall ask it again. All 59 of us resign for the O'Day shooting and resign for the failure of the homeless development racket crisis. Giveaway. Buy off. And I just love Nick Fish. I don't know if I agree with him. I think he's maybe too esoteric for my comprehension.
 But he's just very educated, and I would like to attend your meetings and not be escorted out by brutal men like Todd Engstrom, a massive, brutal man who needs to lose his strong and be an Eng like me, a peaceful Norwegian. Thank you. Good morning. Anyone else who would like to take that opportunity? Come on up.
 I'm really, really happy to be here because of Terminal 1, and there's a lot of people that are not here today because from June 15th to August 15th, 95 neighborhood associations don't meet, seven coalition offices don't meet, and this popped on my calendar so fast. Here I am. Mary Ann, you need to put your name in the record. Mary Ann Schwab, community advocate. For kids, let's go back in time space, this back to Measure 5 and Measure 50.
 I was in a church with Jack Beerworth. He didn't know the Pearl was going to be putting condos down there, and he questioned back then, where am I going to put those kids to school? At the time, we had MLC, we had St. Mary's Cathedral, we had...
 Chapman fast forward the last six months Portland public schools has shattered all those neighborhood associations to make room for the teenagers now in both Lincoln High School and Wilson High School we talk COTs but we're putting kids on school buses to bridal miles some of the lower subsidized kids are being rushed to another school I would like to see this deed traded this water rate payer has a vested interest as does everyone in this room
 in that property. We need to start collecting SCDs so these developers that are building these towers to the sky start financing our schools. And we need this land. I own it. Why can't we just land bank it and give it to Portland Public Schools and put a high school there?
 And when I've gone down to Centennial Mills with PDC, I asked the same question. When I went and attended the one on Broadway, I asked the same question. Why is it no one's paying attention to the education of our kids? How can we have workforce companies come to the city when we have such poor ratings with graduation with our kids?
 I've submitted stuff here to you. I'm not going to read it into the record because right now I am too frustrated, especially finding 14 pages of proposals for the downtown area in the central city. And our kids, how is it OMSI still, with all these years, cannot get transportation from OMSI out to Oaks Park? We use it or lose it.
 And it's not OMSI's responsibility only to give us a parking off place. Thank you, Mary Ann. So everybody in here has got eyes on you as of August 16th. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, let's move to the sign-up sheet, please. The first three are Harriet Heisey, Catherine Anderson, and Kimberly Eng, and they'll be followed by Rob Curtis, Melissa Encita Jaffe, and Paul Eddalls. Welcome again. You need only give your name and –
 Please do that for the record and try to hold yourself to two minutes so we can hear everyone. Thank you. My name is Harriet Heisey, and I'm here today to speak about Terminal 1 selection. I've got a second. Carla, could you turn the mic back on? Sorry. There you go. Go ahead, please. Sorry. Okay. Commissioner Dan Saltzman and Developer Williams have suggested Terminal 1 as a site for homeless shelter. We appreciate their dedication to finding a solution.
 But my daughter and I believe a better facility exists in Rivergate at the unused Wapato Jail. Currently, the new Joint Office of Homeless Services has yet to offer a coordinated shelter program to screen, treat, employ, and transition the homeless into housing and self-sufficiency.
 We believe Wapato can be a model for a successful program that is in use currently in Fort Lyon, Colorado. A recent editorial in the Portland Tribune says, quote, if the city is looking for an unused building that would require very few modifications, it should push Multnomah County to free up space in the Mossbald Wapato Jail.
 Multnomah County Chair Khafouri refuses to consider Wapato as a temporary shelter and has cited six reasons to justify the exclusion of that facility. We debunk them here. Number one, financing restrictions. Wapato is county-owned and its use would fulfill a public need as defined by the bond measure used to build it. Number two, operating costs.
 On July 7, Mark Jolin told neighbors at the Hanson Building meeting that the City-County Homeless Office has $31.2 million to serve 1,100 beds for the fiscal year. Using that budget and deducting 15% for administrative costs equates to $24,000 per bed.
 That would leave $13 million to operate Wapato at its 525-bed capacity.
 Kafori said the 200-bed Hanson building would cost approximately $1.3 million annually, or $6,500 per bed. So that was your two minutes. Let me ask you to stop because we do have your written testimony, and obviously we'll review that. All right. My daughter will go on. I appreciate you putting this in writing for us, so thank you. Thank you very much. Welcome. Again, my name is Catherine Anderson, and I just want to thank you for taking the time to hear about Wapato. I encourage you to read it.
 Again, all of Multnomah County Chair's concerns about the use of Wapato have been debunked with facts that are there on your sheet before you. And I would just ask for you to give it serious consideration and do what Commissioner Kofori has advocated, which is work together.
 with multiple governmental agencies to help provide a safe and secure place for homeless and treat and meet their needs, which are an array of them. So, again, thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Welcome. Thank you.
 I get your $120, too. It doesn't work that way. Good morning, Mayor and Commissioners. Thank you for taking the time to hear our testimony this morning. My name is Kimberly Eng, and my husband and I live one block from the proposed Terminal 1 shelter site. I'm here on behalf of hundreds of Riverscape residents in my neighborhood, and I actually want to introduce you to my neighborhood, to our neighborhood today.
 We are dynamic, we're growing, we're diverse. We're gay, straight, single, we're retirees, we're black, white, Asian. We are families with young children, and some of us have disabilities. We represent everything that is unique, diverse, and exciting about this city. We have 600 residents, growing to 1,200 in the near future. We're one of Portland's most vibrant and vast growing communities. The city is our playground, and the waterfront is the front yard for our children.
 We are somewhat isolated under the Fremont Bridge. We're about a one-mile walk to the city core. This is the same one-mile walk that residents at Terminal 1 would need to walk to access the city core. We have witnessed several unsafe activities causing fear for our mothers and for our children in our communities. We have witnessed several unsafe activities causing fear for our mothers and for our children in our communities.
 We have witnessed harassment, drug activity. We have found syringes in our front yard. We've had items stolen from our front porches, and we've even seen weapons. Last week, we were walking our dogs, and there was a man with a hunting knife walking our front waterfront porch. We've had our doorbells ringing in the middle of the night to find mentally unstable homeless citizens on the front porch.
 Across the street recently, there was a camp, a small camp, where they uncovered about three rifles. This is in our neighborhood. We found a man bathing at the Pacifica Fountain across the street. Additionally, we are one quarter of a mile from the Montessori Child Peace School. One quarter of a mile. Can we imagine if we exasperate these issues across the street from Child Peace Montessori School, what does that do for our children? Okay.
 Additionally, high concentrations of mentally unstable and houseless citizens is not a proven formula. Springwater Court or our own backyard here in Portland, we call it the avenue of terror in this city. Assault, harassment, theft, and criminal, I urge you to please vote no for this inhumane, irresponsible, and unsafe idea for Portland. Thank you for your consideration. Thank you very much. Thank you all.
 Okay, let's take the next three, please. Our Rob Curtis, Melissa and Sita Jaffe, and Paul Edalls, and they'll be followed by Brian Lynch, David Hoff, and Amy Hoffman. Okay, good morning. Who'd like to start? I guess I will. Thank you for taking the time to listen to all the different feedback that's here. It's great to listen to everybody's opinion because that's the way you drive good decisions. Thank you.
 My name is Rob Curtis, and I represent hundreds of residents from the Riverscape neighborhood. I ask one question. If Monsanto made the decision to pollute our waters because they didn't do the due diligence to know they had a problem, does that absolve them? Thankfully, when businesses make decisions without doing due diligence, the people making the decision to proceed are responsible, whether it be criminally or fiscally.
 I'd argue this is the same case here. Do the people voting for this measure take responsibility for every abused woman or child that's assaulted on that site or in the neighborhood because you didn't equip it with a plan that would keep them safe? Every potential health issue that is caused by knowingly putting people in a Superfund site not zoned for human beings to live. Have you determined the legal liability of the city council making a decision to put a homeless shelter on such a site? Why this lot?
 There's a lot a half mile away that has less economic value at Northwest Eon. Is there a reason? How serious are you about creating jobs to prevent future homelessness if you're willing to disregard a key point behind the comprehensive plan? With bids scheduled to come in days, why are we having this discussion now? You do realize that an 8% return on a $12 million investment deferred one year could actually pay for 50 units and 100 people would be off the streets tomorrow just from the interest alone.
 To be frank, have you done the due diligence to protect the city and the taxpayers' interests? Bias for action can be great. I respect what you're trying to do here. But bias for action without direction, it's like having a loaded gun and firing before aiming. You essentially are shuffling the problem from one area of the city to another.
 As one of the hundreds in the crowd, I'm asking you to stop and think a little bit about what you're doing. Due diligence is meant to allow smart people to mitigate risk. It's meant to enable you to make difficult decisions. Please aim the gun before firing. People's lives are worth you taking the time to manage the implications of the decisions you're making.
 We realize that you think you're helping, but the homeless and the citizens of Portland aren't a social experiment to test the hypotheses that hasn't been vetted. If Homer Williams is sincere about helping the homeless and building the equivalent of Haven for Hope, can it happen at a place that doesn't have the immediate economic potential and environmental complexities of Terminal 1?
 Thank you for your time. Thank you. Thank you very much. Good morning. Good morning. My name is Melissa Jaffe. This is my daughter, Sita. We are residents at the Waterline Apartments. I'm also a business owner, and Sita is planning to attend the Montessori School located...
 nearby. We recently moved our entire lives to less than 250 yards from the proposed Terminal 1 site. I am personally, individually, contractually obligated to over $10,000 a month in all of my tuitions, rents, and expenses. I cannot pick up and leave this situation. I am contractually obliged to remain there and to terminate the contract.
 alone would put us in a precarious and disastrous situation. I carefully selected this location for our lives because of the safety and remarkable family-friendly features of this property. When I signed my commitments three months ago, there was no suggestion that there would be new neighbors of 500 to potentially 1,700 sex offenders, homeless, drug addicts in our immediate space.
 My child does not understand the complexities of alcohol addiction, drug addiction, mental instability, and homelessness. To her, everyone is a friend. She trusts everyone without prejudice, without discrimination. I walk my daughter to school. At the start of the month, our pathway was reduced by half due to construction across the street. Similarly, the one-way directional pathway.
 egress into the city is reduced by half, forcing every pedestrian to walk directly in front of our front door. With the number of residents coming in and out of our personal location, there's no possible way to effectively monitor who's coming in and out, whether they have a right to be there. My daughter is warm, smiling, engaging, and she's incredibly attractive to all types. Hey folks, please, don't do that. Go ahead, please.
 Go ahead. My daughter freely shares her name, age, where she lives, when she's going to have babysitters, what our plans are. The combination of all the children, not just her, in this area and the Terminal 1 proposal is potentially disastrous for us. I'm requesting one thing for you. Slow down. Please do not make a hasty decision to move large numbers of individuals with unknown conditions.
 Into the neighborhood and risk our most innocent and needy population our children to see how it goes Please do not sacrifice the safety of myself or my daughter. I have not heard any criteria for inclusion into the site I have not heard any proposal for staffing safety measures boundaries community integration community beautification any kind of community full
 I need you to wrap up, but thank you. Anything else you want to add before you close? I don't want to cut you off completely. Yeah. I think that we have an incredible opportunity to devise a well-thought-through plan to address our obvious problem. Alternatively, this can also be a massive scar on the face of Portland. I'm asking that we consider all of the citizens.
 in making this decision, and please consider our voice too. Thank you. Thank you very much. Good morning. Good morning. My name is Paul Edels. Me and my partner are current homeowners in the Ripperscape neighborhood.
 We have approximately two blocks from Terminal 1 site and have concerns about the physical safety of the area for the homeless persons, particularly those with severe persistent mental illness. I believe the city is assuming significant liability for the safety of the homeless without having done due diligence in investigating the immediate areas surrounding Terminal 1. Since moving to our current home four years ago, I've witnessed many instances finding myself concerned for the safety of homeless in our area.
 One such episode was a homeless man's bicycle trailer being run over by an Amtrak train. He ignored the barriers, signals indicating the train was coming. I also watched a mentally ill woman attempt to climb over the railing outside our house with an easy 40-50 foot drop that would have undoubtedly killed her had we not intervened. Our concern is the proximity to the open railroad tracks, which present a clear and apparent danger to any homeless person suffering from substance dependence or severe persistent mental illness.
 who either do not perceive physical danger or who, in fact, attempting suicide. These physical dangers are within a half block from the terminal on site. Additionally, there is a major substation directly across the street from the site and multiple active construction sites with flimsy fences nearby, which could also pose physical risk to persons with mental illness. The more homeless people that are concentrated in this area, the higher the risk of major accidents, including loss of life, which in this
 location is inevitable. The safety risk is made worse by environmental toxins that have been identified in the space. According to DEQ, the site has been contaminated with lead, arsenic, and petroleum products. While partial abatement has occurred, this was done to industrial use standards and not residential use standards. Similar abatement was needed to happen for a residential building site in front of our community, which took six to eight months to complete. The
 including soil sampling, removal of contaminated soil, and retesting. While Portland finds itself in a homeless crisis, appropriate protection of the homeless people being sheltered must be considered. This is a process that cannot be rushed without jeopardizing the health of the homeless being warehoused in this space. Making people live in Terminal 1 after short-cutting the removal of lead, arsenic, and petroleum compounds from the environment is extremely unethical. I'll get you to wrap up if you can, please. If the city...
 Council insists on warehousing people. There is other sites, temporary shelters that could alleviate the safety concerns such as Wapato and a space located at 3200 block on northwest Yon. Appreciate your time. Great. Thank you all. Thanks very much. These three are Brian Lynch, Dave Hoff and Amy Hoffman. And they'll be followed by Steve Purvis, Stuart Emmons and Ree Carhus. Good morning. Good morning.
 My name is Brian Lynch, and I live at Riverscape. I, too, represent the 600 current residents of this community and the near future residents of the 650 units currently nearing completion. What you're hearing today are very concerned citizens of Portland who have chosen to pioneer this northern part of the city and make it their home. We're a community of families, families of great diversity, who have become very concerned with their safety and are simply asking for due diligence on a project that will have monumental effect on our city if it proceeds at this pace.
 under-investigated and unvetted. Having heard many of the concerns, mine is particularly with crime and the effect it will have on our community if a shelter like the ill-conceived one proposed at T1 comes to fruition. We, as you do, wish to resolve the issues with the less fortunate. Our community sits in a geographically peculiar space, one that's contained between the river and a railroad track. Depending on where you stand, there's 100 to 200 yards from one side to the next.
 This restricts everyone's ability to navigate their way into and out of our community, leaving only one sidewalk for public use. We can already feel the pressure of additional traffic and see our walkways being used to get to and from the river. But what happens when our small community doubles, and then doubles again in size? The proposal is suggesting a potential 1,400 homeless be housed at T1, more than one for every citizen in our community. What happens then? How do you propose public officials guarantee our safety then?
 It's senseless to deny an increase in crime, and let's discuss the shelter that this idea is modeled on, Haven for Hope. At Haven for Hope, 1,877 calls to the police from January 2014 to December 2015. That's almost three a day. At Haven for Hope, there were 318 neighborhood disturbances in the same time period. At Haven for Hope, there were hundreds of 9-11 hangups that needed to be investigated, and 48% increase in calls in the surrounding half-mile area.
 At Haven for Hope, there were 178 thefts in that same time period, 200 assaults, and a 600% increase in prostitution and in drug charges. May I ask you to wrap up soon, please? Yes. Due diligence is what we're asking for. This is not a solution for individuals suffering from mental illness and chronic addiction. It's, in fact, an opportunity for those who prey upon them.
 an opportunity for criminals, drug dealers, and human traffickers. The waterfront is our most valuable resource, and historically no city has allocated the resource in this manner. I ask you to think Utah and not think Texas. Thank you. Who would like to go next, please? Go next, please.
 Hi, my name is Amy Hoffman. I'm here on behalf of my community to say Haven for Hope is not a success story. While they're quick to point out anecdotal stories of success, it's important to remember that as an organization, they still need to promote their facility for continued funding. When looking at actual statistics, another story emerges. In the six years since opening, Haven for Hope has only reduced the unsheltered homeless population of San Antonio by 15%.
 That's 85% of the homeless population still without services, despite the $15 million per year spent operating Haven for Hope and the over $100 million which went into its construction. By concentrating all of their resources in one building, Haven for Hope takes funding away from services already in the communities where these homeless people come from, forcing them all into one central location, effectively institutionalizing homelessness, and magnifying the effects of impacts of a massive homeless shelter in one small residential area.
 Within two years of the facility opening, calls to police about vice problems such as prostitution and gambling in the surrounding neighborhood went up by 580%. This was an area that was referred to as Crack Alley before Haven for Hope went in, and crime still dramatically increased.
 One of the many reasons some of San Antonio's homeless have not gone to Haven for Hope is that it's not safe. In its first two years, the San Antonio Police Department responded to Haven for Hope 1,877 times. Police were called 318 times for disturbances, sometimes with weapons, and more than 200 times for assaults.
 Theft and drug use were common occurrences. In response to the crime, Haven for Hope was forced to hire three off-duty police officers, 40 security guards, and install 550 cameras, which were monitored by dispatchers. They had to install lockers to prevent theft and metal detectors to prevent weapons. This type of mega-facility is a hotbed for those looking to take advantage of people with disabilities, mental health problems, and drug addiction. This is not a healthy climate for recovery or rehabilitation."
 The idea of a Walmart-type one-stop shop for homeless solutions might sound good in theory, but in practical application, it's shown to be ineffective and dangerous for the residents of the shelter and surrounding community alike. By providing temporary shelter in a massive compound and limiting resources in other areas, we would be segregating the city's most vulnerable and most in need of resources instead of working to integrate them into our community. This is an out-of-sight, out-of-mind solution."
 The following model, the model for Haven for Hope, is a Texas answer to a Portland problem. Studies based on behavioral economics would recommend subsidized housing, which is a much more Portland approach. I implore you to please consider the long-term ramifications of this type of facility. On the surface, it seems like an easy solution, but upon closer investigation, it's a money pit and a crime magnet. Thank you. Good morning. Good morning. Thank you for your time this morning.
 I was born in Portland, have lived in Portland. Give us your name first, please. Excuse me, Dave Hoof. I've lived in Portland most of my life and am a proud Portlander. Today I'm here representing 850 households created in the Riverscape neighborhood over the last 10 years. On the former T1 South site were the adjacent neighbors. I worked in Old Town for many years.
 and am active in the community of Old Town and volunteer for organizations that work with the homeless and the near homeless. I understand the homeless problem. These are long-term, complex problems that require long-term, comprehensive solutions. I know I don't have to tell you that, but I had to say it. The proposal on the table today seems like a shot from the hip, frankly,
 The idea seems to have come from one person, and all the due diligence and due process has been swept aside. I've never seen this happen in Portland. We are about transparency. We're about public process, and we've had none of it here. Neighbors didn't even get notified that this was about to happen. I appreciate Mr. Williams' willingness to share a big vision. This problem needs a big vision.
 But this idea is far from being ready for implementation, either short-term or long-term. One thing that's clear is that housing 400 people in an open building is a formula for extensive behavioral and public health problems. We haven't seen the support for this issue. It was raised earlier, I believe, by Commissioner Fish. Even if the Haven for Hope model were ultimately deemed viable, this is the wrong site because
 This is an industrial site not fit for human habitation. The site has environmental issues, infrastructure issues, safety issues, and security issues. It's hard to envision how this site could be converted into a habitable site in time to call it a short-term solution. I would go into the fact that additionally the site is obviously zone-heavy industrial. We've got offers coming in for it.
 that could create jobs, et cetera, et cetera. This is clearly a win-win situation if we let the normal process take its due course for Portland. Thank you. But I'll move on. Wrap up if you can, please. We understand the council's desire to find solutions for this as quickly as possible. But this circumventing the process is not appropriate, and
 We have a solution under our nose, and we find it extremely difficult to understand why we're not taking the time to examine Wapato. There's other sites as well, but why don't we use the $100,000 that we're talking about here today to study Wapato? How can we make that work? It's an existing facility built to institutional quality.
 It's ready to go. Thanks a lot. Thank you all. Thanks for your time. I understand there's a young person that wants to speak, and then we'll return to the list after that, or a superhero, or both. Good morning. Hi. Hi. How did you end up there? Tell us who you are. What? Who are you? What's your name? Mr. Jaffe. Do you want to tell us something? Go ahead. How old are you, honey? 20.
 How old are you? Three and a half. Cool. Wow. You might be the youngest person that's spoken here. That's pretty cool. So...
 I wanted you guys to not build a homeless building. Okay. Well, thank you very much. Okay. Hey, hey, hey, hey. That's all right. We always let children speak here. Thank you very much. All right. Let's take the next three folks, please. Our Steve Purvis, Stuart Emmons, and Ree Karas. And they'll be followed by Rich Rogers, Pete Heibertson, and Bill Russell. Good morning. Morning. Good morning.
 My name is Steve Purvis and I'm here representing hundreds, hundreds of people from the Riverscape community. I urge each of you to vote no to pursuing this proposal any further and instead consider a potential alternative. An immediate alternative to the proposed Terminal 1 mega shelter would be establishing multiple scaled connected equitably distributed shelters throughout the facility. This approach would afford both homeless individuals and service providers easier access to the
 easier access to the facilities thereby increasing their reach and effectiveness while also serving to minimize the negative impacts and safety concerns with your inherent one large-scale facility on both the patrons and the surrounding community
 While acknowledging that the establishment of multiple scaled facilities throughout the city requires identifying suitable locations, the city has already undertaken this process and investigated over 120 potential sites in the last year, going so far as to identify five sites as ideal candidates and an additional 15 sites as promising candidates.
 Some of the considerations with the negatively effect of potential sites feasibility include needing costly renovations, safety concerns, and zoning issues, all of which apply to the Terminal 1 location. So I ask each of you the question, why isn't the city looking more closely at some of these other more promising potential sites? Are there ulterior motives at hand with regard to the Terminal 1 site? Even in the Northwest Industrial District, there is a site on Neon Avenue less than one mile from Terminal 1, which appears to be a more suitable location.
 From a more long-term perspective, investigating and potentially instituting a housing first model which seeks to provide permanent housing to the homeless via rental assistance and support services has resulted in housing retention rates between 75 and 98 percent across multiple studies. These programs have also proven to be cost effective, up to $23,000 less per consumer per year than a traditional shelter program according to one study and $31,000 less per consumer over a two-year period according to another.
 Lastly, others have already spoken to the Wapato facility, but that seems to be an obvious resource that's not being utilized that could also be deployed toward this crisis facing the city. So I ask each of you, looking at the homelessness issue facing the city objectively, how does a Terminal 1 mega-shelter possibly compare favorably to any of the alternatives? How does it even make sense at all? Thank you. Good morning. I'd like to be next. Pretty? You want to go?
 Good morning. My name is Rui. I'm the executive director with Boots on the Ground PDX. I'm going to add something here. I want to say, first of all, that when we are talking about communities that are in the top 10% in the economic bracket of this city,
 I think that there is a little bit of social obligation on the part of those communities to be willing to put forth more investment in this problem. I don't think that children in the Pearl are more beautiful or valuable than children out in Lentz. That being said... Folks, folks, please. Folks. That being said... Uh...
 Boots is provisionally behind this move. We have a lot of misgivings. It could go south really badly. We are looking for more input from the community and from the actual service providers that are likely to be providing these services.
 I think this is a nice first step for it. As far as the financial implications for the jobs created, if this goes well, there's going to be more than 50 jobs at this site. And also, I think that when it comes to job creation, I think that we also need to have...
 Some social responsibility for creating space for those without. The economic sector is very important, and so is our social responsibility to the houseless. Thank you. Can I just, recognizing we have lots of people testifying.
 Can I ask you a question? Have you been formally invited to sit at the table to shape the program or to serve in a role as a community oversight person? If the answer is no, I'm going to nominate you because I think we should have a community oversight group. But have you been invited in to actually shape the proposal?
 We have been in negotiations with Mr. Williams and Mr. Mazzotti, and we hope we can come to some sort of resolutions. People are pretty firm in their vision, and we would hope that would be a little more malleable and fitable to the Portland paradigm. So could you keep the council apprised of those discussions? Yes.
 Absolutely. Thank you. Thank you very much. Good morning. Good morning, Mayor and Commissioners. My name is Stuart Emmons. I'm an architect who's designed quite a bit of homeless housing and homeless shelters. I worked with Homer Williams on South Waterfront for two years, and I want to thank him for proposing private dollars to help solve homelessness. I am opposed to T1 for a homeless shelter based on economic, environmental, humanistic, and lack of community involvement.
 The six-month lease is going to be permanent. Humanistic, I was out at Springwater Carter the night before last, Hazelnut Grove last night. I talked to the residents. They are scared about this proposal. They do not want to move here. There was a unanimous no from the homeless community that I talked to. Environmental, T1 is an...
 Absolutely, an excellent industrial site. The comp plan says use it for industrial. We don't want to set a bad precedent here. We don't want to keep on filling in wetlands and trees for industrial land when we've got this great industrial property already. Economic, how much is this project ultimately going to cost the taxpayers? This is fiscally irresponsible to walk into this without knowing what the money looks like.
 This is also a rare land, a rare property for close-in jobs. I want to recommend housing is the answer. Dollars, private dollars need to go to housing. Many feel this could become one of the worst decisions from this council. I would like to see a new level of help for the home for everyone and get solutions fast and online.
 And at the very least, I would encourage a delay to get community input and more due diligence on this property. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks very much. Let's take the next folks, please. Rich Rogers, Pete Hyberson, and Bill Russell. And they'll be followed by Ibrahim Mubarak, Dr. Ann Myers, and Avery Hutchins.
 Good morning. It's a morning. Rich Rogers, Southeast Portland. Thanks for taking the time to dig into this today. It's been since 2008 since I worked here as a policy advisor for Commissioner Senn. It's been a little bit over 20 years now that I've been working on housing policy in one way or another in this community. And the longer I work on it and the worse things get, you know, the more
 discouraging it can be, but there are some encouraging steps. I think over the last year, Mayor in particular, you've been particularly courageous in trying out new risky things that are admittedly risky, and I commend you for that. The – and a lot of it's worked. We've seen a more humane and rational approach to people sleeping outside that begins to treat people with more dignity.
 I have been involved recently just as a volunteer trying to help to advance the voices and the interest of people who are sleeping outside in organized camps and people that are working with them to help as volunteers and as advocates. And we sat down last night. There have been a couple conversations, obviously, this is a quick-moving proposal, for a couple hours with Homer Williams and Don Mazziotti and their team.
 I found them to be somewhat humble in their approach, which is encouraging, recognizing that there's a lot they don't know and they express their willingness to work with the groups that are out in the community to shape their proposal and to make it effective. I also am provisionally supportive of this.
 proposal. I've stated concerns. They've been stated already. I think it's easy to get to no. I think it's really hard to get to yes on something like this. So I commend the private sector folks for stepping up, being willing to invest resources. That's a piece to the solution that we have.
 haven't had and we need, and if we can combine that with real collaboration with people who are experiencing homelessness so that they are empowered, they have self-determination, that homelessness is not criminalized, people are treated with dignity. If those two groups can get together, I'm confident that over time they'll see the wisdom that both sides bring to it. And so I'm willing to take a leap of faith at this point, and I appreciate everyone's willingness to take those steps. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you. Good morning. Good morning.
 My name is Pete Heibertson, and as a member of Portland Tenants United, I'm here to add our support for concerns raised by unhoused people, advocates, and organizations about Terminal 1. And there are significant concerns here, including environmental toxicity, minimal public process, and virtually no defined details about the model for service delivery. While we urgently need more resources to address the housing emergency, real and lasting solutions require meaningful collaboration with the people who are affected.
 Unhoused people living on the Springwater Corridor have expressed to us that mass shelters, like the one that's proposed, are not appropriate for their needs, and the mass eviction of those communities is not going to solve this problem either. Compared to service agencies placing people in permanent housing and community-based solutions like RTD2 and Hazelnut Grove, this proposed mass shelter is fiscally inefficient and uninformed by the perspectives of unhoused people.
 Many tenants in Portland are just a rent hike, a no-cause eviction, a missed paycheck away from joining our unhoused neighbors outside. Unhoused people who transition into housing immediately become some of the most vulnerable tenants in town here. Long-term solutions to these challenges are going to be the ones that support stable communities in our city, not temporary mass solutions that don't match the needs of the community they're meant to serve.
 another mass shelter is not going to prevent vulnerable tenants from becoming unhoused policies that curtail arbitrary no-cause evictions and massive rent hikes will another mass shelter is not going to support healing and transition into permanent housing for our unhoused neighbors stable transitional communities like r2d2 and hazelnut grove will i urge you to join us in insisting that any plans for new shelters be developed in full partnership with unhoused people with the understanding that warehousing people is entirely unacceptable
 Also, in the absence of acceptable alternatives and alternate land for the residents of the Springwater Corridor, we continue to oppose the mass displacement as planned for September 1st. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you both. Next three are Ibrahim Mubarak, Dr. Ann Myers, and Avery Hutchins, and they will be followed by Alicia A. Fuchs, Desiree Rose, and Lee Novak.
 I'm Ibrahim Mubarak from Right to Survive and Right to Dream 2, and I'm caught up in an oxymoronic situation. The years before this same group was against Right to Dream 2 moving into Pearl District, until they were asked to go out into the house of this community and talk with people to see they are human, that they have real needs.
 And they have a change of heart and they want to do something. Is it the right thing? I don't know. We don't know. But they want to do something. All my life, I've been told what I couldn't do. I couldn't go to this bathroom for white people only. I couldn't go to the restaurant for white people only. I couldn't even date a white woman. I couldn't wait to marry my wife. She's white. I'm tired of people telling me what I can't do if they don't know me.
 The helpless community, everywhere we try to go, the neighborhoods associations say, not here but over there, not here but over there. They don't even know. You created an emergency shelter thing where people can put tents up. They're not allowed to put tents up now. Now you want to move over 500 people from the spring water corridor. Where are they going to go?
 They've been directed on what we can do, what we can't do. I think not as the city council, but as a city, we live beneath our privilege if we don't help the houseless community. We need to put our differences behind us.
 but they can't do it. The neighborhood association, this neighborhood association can't do it because they're prejudiced they're biased, they're cruel and they're fucked up in their mind teaching their children to be prejudiced against them. Children are not prejudiced they don't grow there, I taught that I wouldn't want to move in that area because I'm afraid of those houseless people thank you
 Go ahead, please. Welcome. Nice to have you here. Hi. Thank you for the opportunity to speak. Before I start saying my name, I'm sorry, Avery Hutchins. Thanks, Avery. This speech is not something that my mom wrote for me to say. I wrote it myself. Hi. My name is Avery Hutchins. I'm in seventh grade, and I'm a resident of the Riverscape community. The recent proposal to use Terminal 1 as a homeless shelter has me concerned for the safety of children and families in my neighborhood. Okay.
 Right now, I'm able to ride my scooter down the boardwalk, play in common areas with my friends, and wait for the school bus in the morning. I worry that if the homeless population in our neighborhood increases dramatically, I won't be able to do these things without an adult to keep me safe. There are kids of all ages where I live, and kids younger than me may not know better than to talk to strangers, which I would imagine would be all around the neighborhood if Terminal 1 becomes a homeless shelter.
 While I understand that it is important to offer our homeless population alternatives to camping on the street, I urge the city to please consider a location that has a lesser impact on established community and on families. There is a children's school with students ages 1 to 15 less than a 10-minute walk away from Terminal 1. I looked it up on Google Maps.
 I used to live in the Pearl District. I had to move here because with the incredibly... I had to move to the Riverscape District because with the incredibly large homeless population there, I was not able to walk outside my condo building on my own. Cigarette butts and shattered beer bottles on the sidewalks didn't exactly scream safety. If I have to move again for the same...
 To have to move again for the same reason would be difficult for me and my family. Thank you. Thank you very much. Okay, let's take the next three folks, please. Our Alicia A. Fuchs, Desiree Rose, and Lee Novak, and they'll be followed by Stephen Gomez, Tom Cody, and Brian Ferdie. Good afternoon. Why don't you start, please? Hi, I'm Desiree Rose. I'm a resident of Hazelnut Grove.
 We are an intentional community for homeless people, and we have been trying to prove that we can be good neighbors, that we can have a good outcome for homeless people, work as we know as street families. There's so much to discuss. I feel bad for some of these people who are concerned about their neighborhoods, and I understand some of their fears. But let's be realistic. Since when is it a new thing for criminals to hide amongst the poor? They pretty much always have.
 and party goers. That's always happened, and we're sorry about that. But we spend all of our time just trying to survive and trying to protect ourselves from those people. You guys already have a prison. You have Wapato. Why do you want to build another one? We don't understand.
 A lot of these people, a lot of these people who are residents, they sat by and watched while city and state government has, with great glee and gusto, done everything in their power to destroy the poor. And they only care when it comes around their neighborhood. Oh, no, now what do we do? Okay. We can, $100 million for a big high-rise prison, we won't go there. There's a lot of us. I'm a veteran. Okay. We've been getting kicked in the gutters for 50 years, okay?
 We stood to protect the freedom of this country, and yet when we came back, we got kicked in the gutter and we're being denied hours. I do not want to live in a prison. I won't go, especially that's run by the programs the way that the programs are run here. They're run to destroy people. Working with neighborhood groups.
 Business people, people who have stepped up to show us that they care about us and they're here to fight with us. Now, people that have shown us some trust, we're willing to work with. People that tell us, oh, we treat you with respect, well, that's a big slap in the face, and we know it. It's a lie. No, we will not go. Nothing about us without us. Thank you very much. Welcome. Good afternoon. Hello.
 I am a retired Multnomah County judge. Give us your name, too, please. Alicia Fuchs. Thanks, Alicia. I've worked with Doreen Binder and the Bud Clark Commons for some period of time.
 After I retired I have seen what her program has done for the homeless the proposed plan by the city For the homeless is ill-conceived as we look at it now the homeless need a place to be safe and get well Not a place Convenient for city planners because developer has offered a funding the project now being suggested does not have the structure to provide the services needed by the homeless and
 The planned location is also inappropriate as it abuts an expanding residential community. We have the resources to create permanent shelter and an appropriate location for care for the homeless that will make our community healthier and safer. This location is not going to be a success for the homeless population. The need to access services that will allow them to ascend to permanent housing.
 Thank you. Thank you. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Good morning or afternoon. My name is Lee Novak. I represent 4 Property Company, 4800 Southwest McAdam. Over the last three years, 4 Property has developed over 650 apartments on Terminal 1 South in three separate projects. We've invested over $130 million and helped reinvigorate the neighborhood with new residents. We're concerned about the proposed homeless facility at Terminal 1 North and
 The site is an industrial site that lies at the outer fringe of the residential portions of our city. There are no existing facilities. The site has a dilapidated warehouse and a structurally weak pier. Transportation options are limited and sidewalks non-existent. The distinction between an internment camp and a successful facility for the homeless depends on resolving these challenges. Our firm has developed over 10,000 units of affordable housing all over the country. Never have we seen a process that grants a lease first and sale and asks for a plan second.
 It is clear that there exist no answers to these questions at this time, and we ask that you develop a plan to address the security, services, transportation issues before making a decision. In addition, we believe City Council needs to address two significant legal issues related to the site. The current zoning and future zoning don't allow for this use. Significant changes to the zoning shouldn't be undertaken without a more considered process. The changes for the comprehensive plan that have been discussed today
 in the neighborhood, have not been discussed in the neighborhood. And this is the first public discussion of this issue. As stated earlier, we've developed over 650 units on Terminal 1 South where we had an existing record decision for residential use. This stack of documents includes all the study and reporting we've done. I've also included a summary memo describing that work. The cost of that remediation has been the millions of dollars.
 This is over and above the millions spent by the Port of Portland when the site was initially converted to residential use over a decade ago. The port removed 33,000 cubic or tons of materials, and we removed over 77,000 cubic yards of material to address PAHs, hydrocarbons, arsenic, and lead. This is a time-consuming process that obviously has not been done for this site for this use.
 One note, we tried to lease a portion of the existing lot for parking during our construction next door, and we've been rebuffed because of the sales process. We think that sales process should proceed forward, and we should at least see the results of that before the City Council makes a decision. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks very much. Okay. Let's take the next folks, please. Our Stephen Gomez, Tom Cody, and Brian Faraday, and they'll be followed by Terry Light,
 David Brown and Joe Walsh. Good afternoon. Welcome. Good morning, Mayor and Commissioners. I'm Stephen Gomez. I'm a resident of the Boise Neighborhood Association in North Portland. I testified earlier this year to council as a Boise Neighborhood Association board member in support of an affordable housing multi-grant for the developer of four large apartments in our neighborhood.
 I'm working with the Welcome Home Coalition as a major supporter of the upcoming $258 million Yes for Affordable Homes bond measure, but more germane to today's deliberation. For 11 years, I served on the board, including three as board chair of New Avenues for Youth, which, as you know, is Portland's leading nonprofit addressing youth homelessness at its root causes. I share these experiences because I believe the challenges in our community must be addressed by a combination of community members, businessmen, and people.
 business leaders, nonprofits, and the government. With this in mind, I want to make clear why I oppose Terminal 1 as a mass emergency shelter. The idea is the right source of resources, but the wrong use of them. I applaud Homer Williams' leadership in bringing bold ideas forward for a citywide debate about homelessness. It's bold to declare a willingness to raise $60 million to immediately address the need for shelter. But as a shelter site, Terminal 1 is set up for failure.
 Over the last few weeks, I've spoken to leaders and advocates in the homelessness and housing communities. Many oppose Terminal 1 as a site, but those that are open to using Terminal 1 say that anything, including Terminal 1, is better than sleeping on the street.
 Sleeping on the street is not an intentional act, but placing our most vulnerable community members at Terminal 1 would be an intentional act. An act ignoring the significant contamination issues cited by the DEQ, ignoring the lack of basic infrastructure at the site, the lack of safety on a street with heavy industrial use, missing and damaged sidewalks, and infrequent bus service. Best practices for developing shelter for homeless persons include distributing appropriately scaled shelter where people are,
 We know that poverty and homelessness now exist to the east in our community. This is why the county's efforts opening shelter at the Hanson Building in Northeast and the 100-bed family shelter on the Portland-Gresham border are so important. I've reviewed the list of sites the city has developed as possible shelter sites, and it appears that many sites have been excluded for the same criteria that would eliminate Terminal 1. I ask why?
 I appreciate the challenge the city has in working through the multitude of objections virtually any proposed shelter site will encounter, but I encourage council to reexamine the list of your sites and select options which do not expose our vulnerable community members to the significant hazards at Terminal 1 and deliver safe shelter and services to locations where our homeless already live. Thank you. Thank you, Stephen. You're welcome. Good afternoon. Good afternoon.
 Good afternoon. I'm Tom Cody. I'm an urban planner, a Portland-based urban planner and developer. I've worked on projects in partnership as a private citizen and developer in partnership with people like the Housing Authority of Portland, now Home Forward. I actually have built permanent supportive housing in partnerships, and we're currently working on a large affordable housing project with Home Forward.
 From our relationships and partnerships with homelessness advocates and service providers, we know that warehousing large numbers of people into one space, apart from the services and support they need, is a poor and ineffective way to address this challenge.
 Instead, we should do what we know works, small shelters distributed throughout the community that provide targeted services for people with different needs, an approach already being successfully implemented throughout the region. Together, the city and the county.
 much thanks to you, has established the Joint Office of Homeless Services, intergovernmental agency focused on addressing homelessness, affordable housing, and related services. That collaboration, along with A Home for Everyone, is producing results. As part of this work, the city and the county have successfully cited a number of shelters,
 recently, exercising an efficient, thoughtful, and effective approach on planning, siting, and servicing. An example is the 200-bed Hanson Building, Northeast 122nd and Gleason, 100-bed family shelter, 162nd East Burnside, city's current work to prepare the Kalbrenner site property, Southeast 105th and Reedway. These three projects not only show what is being done, but how to do it through distributed facilities, each catering to a specific need.
 segment of our homeless population. I know that this is something that cannot be done alone. My colleagues and I at Project, our company, and other business leaders across the community all have a role to play. We've been involved in several affordable housing projects. I've recently offered the city a building that we have in escrow in downtown called the Modish Building on the same block as New Avenues for Youth that would be less expensive, safer, and more serviceable than Terminal 1.
 I understand Terminal 1 seems attractive. It seems easy, empty, available.
 it's completely inappropriate. It's extensive. It will require extensive and costly improvements. The good news is sites that are safer, zoned correctly, and are connected to services, transportation, are available today. The city's produced a list of properties, but that list is not comprehensive. Tom, I need you to wrap up, please. Okay. It excludes viable sites and discards some properties due to criteria.
 Not on the list are obvious sites such as the city-owned site, 38,000 square feet, 300 North Winning Street, adjacent to major transportation. Countless other sites are available on an emergency and or temporary basis. TriMet is currently selling five sites considered to be surplus. And there are two sites where my office is on our block between Northwest 16th, Marshall, and Northrop.
 Available on the open market, none of these sites are on the list. None. As a community, we need to pursue solutions that work and continue to support the work of a home for everyone and the Office of Homeless Services, identifying sites that offer safe shelter,
 accommodate the needs of different populations and provide access to services. We should not allow Terminal 1 proposal to distract us from this work and the good work that the council and the county have been doing. I urge you to reject both the proposed council resolution and the application for the Metro grant. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you both. So let's do a time and process check here. How many people do we still have signed up to speak?
 How about 20, 25? Okay. So I'm going to suggest that we go to 1 o'clock and then take a break, give the council a half-hour mercy break, and then we'll resume at 1.30. Does that work for everybody? Just wanted to let you know, if you're late on that list, we may not hear you until after 1.30. So bear with us. We'll try to hear everyone and keep going. So please. The next three are Terry Light, Vahid Brown, and Joe Walsh.
 and they'll be followed by Lightning Watchdog PDX, Linda S., and Susan Golden. Okay, who'd like to start? I'll go first. Thanks for having a hearing here today. My name is Terry Light, and I'm now currently living in Portland at Hazelnut Grove, and I have lived in a self-organized camp since I've been here in Portland starting at Dignity Village. And then I did a short stint inside a house with three other roommates.
 That situation unfortunately did not work out, so I was back out in Hazel Grove. I have been an advocate for houseless people and an advocate for self-organization. If you guys have any connection with modern science, systems theory works. Life works on self-organization. Too much top management and control over too much information. I tell you, each individual is a lot of information.
 does not work, and you're going to create systems of force and systems of violence. I don't know if I can support this proposal or not because the plan is not evident to me how it will be managed. And I'm also really concerned about how people who are not going to be housed or continue to be treated by our city. Sweeps are wrong, they are traumatic, and do not solve our problem.
 And I think, again, we have to look at our situation of perception of safety, because I hear it's a really big concern. It's a concern for houseless people as well. One of the big problems, I think, in a spring water corridor is the people who are houseless are concerned about safety and the people in the neighborhood are concerned about safety. But who are the people who are going to help organize people so they are safe? If people are organized, they contain their own safety and their own communication system and start creating community and start creating recovery.
 People are confused about recovery. And I keep hearing more and more about talking about recovery from addiction, recovery from mental ill. We have a very addictive society, so of course we have addicted people. There are people indoors and outdoors that have mental illness. Indoors and outdoors. Together we have to solve this problem. And it's a very much bigger concept than who owns what. Because that's also a big problem. Native American people do not have houseless people. We have to really look at that and think about that.
 Thank you. We have a systemic problem we have to work on. Thank you. Thank you very much. Welcome. Good afternoon. Thank you. Good afternoon, Mr. Mayor, Commissioners. My name is Vahid Brown. I work with Clackamas County on housing policy, an organizer with Hazelnut Grove, and I work with a couple of coalitions in Portland that do direct outreach and organizing with houseless folks, the Portland's Houseless Support Coalition and the Village Coalition, both of which are working on looking at identifying and developing village-type models like Hazelnut Grove to house the houseless.
 I have a lot of concerns about this proposal. I kind of agree with Terry that I don't know whether to support it or oppose it because I don't really know what the plan is for management that hasn't been laid out. I do want to commend Homer Williams and the folks that are part of this process in coming forward and standing up as members of the business community to want to be a part of solutions. We have serious problems, and we do need –
 a lot of different approaches and a lot of new resources to address these problems.
 I think an acute one is that there are hundreds of people in the Springwater Corridor that have hanging over their head a sweep notice on September 1. So I think that if we're going to be talking in council and as a city and a community about urgent measures and quick things we can address houselessness, we align that timeline with those people in the corridor. And that if we're going to identify sites or open a warehouse or open a space to put people inside, we align that timeline with the people in the corridor so that we don't,
 First, displace hundreds of people into who knows where. They have nowhere to go legally. And then a month or two later, open up a space. And so that's, as Terry said, those sweeps are traumatic. They cause people to lose their possessions. They cause people to lose touch with their caseworkers. They fall out of the process where they're trying to get services and trying to get housing. It's not an appropriate way to treat our citizens who, for one reason or another, don't have housing. So we need to think about aligning those timelines and thinking about the needs of those people.
 In terms of this project, I think I want to reiterate what Desiree Rose said. It's nothing about us without us. There has not been meaningful upfront engagement and involvement from people from the houses community and people who are engaged directly in organizing with the houses community. And that input needs to be present at the beginning so that we don't get down the road when there's a project and it has some management and then we decide how we're going to involve the voices of the houses. Those need to be upfront, front and center. Thank you. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Good afternoon.
 My name is Joe Walsh. I represent Individuals for Justice. It was really kind of interesting for me to sit here today because I could have testified right away. But I wanted to listen to some of the testimony because I find myself in a really strange position. I'm agreeing with Commissioner Fish, and that is so unusual. If my wife is watching this, she probably fell off the couch. The problem here is the warehousing.
 You cannot warehouse people and do a good job. You can't do it. It never works. You're going to spend a lot of money, and it's going to fail because you haven't done due diligence. Listen to what the commissioner is telling you and go back and redo your homework.
 and get these people that are activists in the homeless community on board. And they have to tell you what to do with that $100 million. You're throwing around a lot of money. And who are you going to ask? You're going to ask the people of this city to come up with $100 million to warehouse the homeless?
 when the Neighborhood Association is blowing their tops. And by the way, this Neighborhood Association is in the same position I am, but they're ugly. What they said today was ugly, and I resent that. And I resent being on the same side as them.
 Do not warehouse people. You've got the micro-houses concept. You've got Salt Lake City concept. You've got really good people here, bright people. Use them and stop trying to do this. You can enter this room prepared to vote. You're going to do what you want.
 But I'm telling you right now, you blow $100 million on this debacle, and none of you will ever be here in four years. I'm telling you that right now. Read the back of my shirt. Thank you. Okay, let's take the next group, please. Our Lightning Watchdog PDX, Linda S. and Susan Golden, and they'll be followed by Wayne Wignes, Dave. I think Dave already spoke, Dave, off.
 it'll be elspeth in tenkari coup and charles johnson next okay lightning i think you're first yes my name is lightning i represent lightning watchdog pdx i talked to the broker this morning on the property out there my biggest concern is to make sure that scott mclean gets his commission
 I want to make sure he gets his commission on this, whether it goes to a lease or not, and it follows through with another sale. He's a great broker, done a tremendous amount of work. He has an exclusive listing. He deserves that, number one, so I want to see him get paid. Lightning, one of my amendments specifically says that he would get his commission paid for by the general fund. Very good. Thank you. Now, an issue with Homer Williams.
 i absolutely agree with his decision on this to move forward with a certain amount of private funding i agree with commissioner saltzman's position on the lease i think due to the fact we're in a state of housing emergency that will override as i talked to mr mclean there are currently two offers on the property have not been accepted as of this time
 I think that will override both those offers. Again, I stated to Mr. McLean, I want to make sure you get paid whether Homer Williams ends up with the property or someone else does. And he said, absolutely. Another issue I'd like to see is Mr. Lee Novak from Ford Developments step up to the table. I was talking to some of his workers the other day.
 I'd like to hear his solutions. I'd like him to talk to Homer Williams. I'd like to hear what he has to say to another prominent developer on how he wants to try to improve the homeless lives throughout this city. He's doing a tremendous amount of development on the riverfront. Now, step up to the table, Lee Novak. It's real impressive to hear all the money you're putting into these projects.
 but it's much more oppressive to look at a developer like Homer Williams trying to also take care of the people who need help in this city, and that's what he's trying to do here today. Thank you. Thank you. Welcome.
 Hi, my name is Linda. Get a little closer, please. Hi, my name is Linda, and I want to just commend you for even doing the work. You know, we as a society tend to exclude our houseless separate from us. Their causes are different, which they are not. I am coming from a different perspective. I'm on the fence with the Terminal 1.
 I look at my four-year-old grandson when we walk around the city. I live in the Pearl. I was blessed to be able to live there. I do live on affordable housing in the Pearl. So my grandson and I have experienced houselessness in our neighborhood right underneath the
 Broadway Bridge. He asked me, Yaya, that's what he calls me, why are there people sleeping in tents by the train station? And I said, well, because they just haven't been able to get a house. Oh, like me, Yaya? Yeah, like you. My grandson's four and the other one's 10 months and they're both experiencing houselessness. Not due because their mother and father don't work
 not due because of domestic violence or drug and alcohol abuse, but due to systemic oppression of all of us. You guys might be less close than I to being houseless, one paycheck away sometimes, but I have help. I have help.
 I want other people to have help too. I've done work with Sisters of the Road being a community ambassador. So I know a lot of the houseless community personally. I see it personally on a day-to-day from my window where I walk or I play. They're us, they're you, they're me. The solution isn't gonna come fast enough to give my grandsons yards to play in and space to push their toys.
 I just want to say continue to delve into solution. I know there's a lot of zombie houses where I've also just said, you know what? I'm desperate for my grandsons to have a yard to play in. There are empty homes that you have charge over. Fix the problem is what we're asking. Find the solution and continue to help. Continue to delve in.
 Thank you. Thank you very much. Next three are Wayne Wignes, Elizabeth Tancury-Kuh, and Charles Johnson. And they'll be followed by, I believe it's John, email has a 48 in it, and Sue Pritzker and Mike Withey.
 Okay, welcome. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. My name is Wayne Wigness. I'd like to direct attention to the 1999 River District implementation plan through which Terminal 1 South came to be zoned residential and in which the preservation of mass shelter infrastructure was explicitly avoided. The reasoning for this was primarily the philosophy that it's better to get people straight into their own housing,
 17 years later, homelessness has only increased and we don't have infrastructure for them.
 Furthermore, the goal of maintaining a certain percentage of affordable housing within the River District, to my knowledge, we're very far off that goal. Even what affordable housing we have provided, I would question whether or not it is actually affordable to the 0 to 35 percent MFI range. I mean, if you need to apply to a rent program just to get it, then by definition, that is not affordable to you. I...
 I'm sorry, about a year ago, you'll recall maybe that I came here and I suggested the city pack a warehouse full of bunk beds and put it on the free rental market. If and when this occurs, it would be much more sustainable so that it could grow to the level that it needs to so that people, everybody who has need of it could do so. And furthermore, it could actually be considered affordable to those within the 0 to 35 percent MFI range.
 I was working just this week with somebody who stays in the Bud Clark Center. He's an alcoholic, but he looked clean. He looked sober. He told me it's keeping me healthy, but 80 beds and four-month time limits is not enough to serve thousands of homeless people in the Portland area. But whether as a monthly rental, transitional housing, or mass shelter, this form of infrastructure should have been preserved within the River District plan.
 To address neighborhood concerns, statistically, homeless are less violent than those indoors. From my own experience, what violence there is is overwhelmingly amongst themselves, and research has shown that even this violence increases when people need to jump from shelter to shelter, as is the case now in Portland. We already have homeless people.
 camped out in front of elementary schools at Cooch Park. They're already causing problems downtown. Creating a centralized place where they can have a guaranteed bed at night, a place to be, I don't think it can make the situation any worse. Drug use can be a problem. On that front, I urge everyone to consider that there is a difference between Texas and Portland. And Texas is dangerous
 and they don't tolerate people sleeping out wherever they want. In Portland, people have options. Why would a drug user lurk around a neighborhood that nobody wants them in when they can go right across the river and enjoy an entire camp in, walk two miles and be gone in the woods, or just go downtown? I don't think drug users want to do that. Lastly, real quick.
 environmentally. Campers throughout Portland aren't exactly helping anything. This could improve that. And in terms of affordable housing, it improves density and increases the sharing and reusing of resources. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks very much. Welcome. Hi. My name is Elspeth Tangweku, and I come to you today as a homed person from Eastmoreland who has experienced homelessness for the first half of my life.
 I care deeply about this issue, and I've been fortunate to emerge from instability and have an amazing existence now. I want to thank you for taking on the issue, all of you. And I want to thank Homer Williams also for leveraging his platform of professional expertise, his resources, to engage a proposal on a grand scale. Thank you.
 Complex problem solving demands a grand vision that's shared and actuated by a broad coalition, if it's going to work. In this proposal's current form, important stakeholders have voiced over and over again—I don't need to go to all of their arguments— why they're reticent to support the T1 North site for this vision. They have good cause.
 Experience and best practices tell us that mass shelters provide operational efficiencies, but they do it at the cost of human dignity, fundamental personal agency, and personal safety. Housing is a human right, and it can't be predicated on requirements for unwanted services and treatments. Folks are not going to come out to T1. Any effort that we make to replicate the Haven of Hope model has to be tempered and shaped with the knowledge
 of who we are as portlanders and it has to come from building a coalition i would ask that i would ask that we recognize the vision that homer williams has but recognize the limitations of the application at hand and so i cannot support an approval of of the resolution at hand thank you thank you thank you very much welcome good afternoon commissioners my name is charles johnson
 And I think many unfortunate things have happened. First, we need to notice an important scientific opportunity. We can determine whether green shirts cause hypocritical nimbyism or hypocritical nimbyism causes green shirts. So beyond that issue...
 Things that shouldn't be conflated are being conflated at this hearing. What Mr. Saltzman is proposing is a temporary shelter over the winter, which may or may not be moved into a grander vision. It's morally imperative that you approve and pass the resolutions Mr. Saltzman has put forward to provide emergency shelter for the winter. Thank you.
 If it's quite possible that Homer Williams will come to a census and realize, oh my gosh, homeless people can be hard to work with, I quit. And then there won't be anything to it. Then we can go ahead and sell Terminal 1 and we can fulfill this crazy idea that's implied between the lines. We've just said, we can't put homeless people there. Let's grow things there and let's make organic beer there. Okay.
 That's what we've said. We can't let the homeless people sleep on this contaminated land because we're going to sell it to a greenhouse or we're going to sell it to a brewery. The homeless people need to sleep there this winter. The fact that rate payers have a one cent damage to their condition because we get $19 million instead of $20 million for the property or whatever the numbers are going to be.
 Portland people will be able to swallow that knowing that we put 400 people inside with emergency temporary heaters, emergency temporary showers, and whatever. So, yeah.
 I'm not fully on board with this bigger model that may be implemented after this winter, but what Mr. Saltzman has put forward does not lock us into anything except saving lives and sheltering people in a more humane condition than they'll be if you don't pass these two items. Thank you. Thank you very much. Okay, let's take the next group, please. The next three are J, first initial is J, last name might be Jensen.
 Email has a 48 in it. And that's also Sue Pritzker and Mike Withey. And they'll be followed by Chloe Utile, Adam Havens, and Jim Howell. Welcome. Thank you. John Jensen, representing IBEW Local 48. First of all, let me apologize for my terrible penmanship. So in the building trades and in construction, I think we're really familiar with correlation between houselessness and joblessness.
 Cyclically, we experience downturns in the construction cycle, and every time we see our members lose their houses from that. As the proponent panel came up in front of us, they acknowledged, I believe, that long-term, this certainly wouldn't be a good solution because of our need to preserve industrial land for jobs. I also want to submit that short-term, I believe that...
 Short-circuiting our process in this way to co-opt this industrial land, even temporarily, I do feel like has a long-term impact. You know, we say this very respectfully of your challenges and this situation and this crisis that you're facing. But I believe that if there are other options, particularly that did not compromise industrial land or potential jobs, those should certainly be explored and explored first.
 And I guess finally we would just ask you to respect your own process and not short-circuit it and not fast-track this and do a little more due diligence, listen to some of the valid concerns raised by the other communities here, and let's find the best solution for this very difficult situation. Thank you. Welcome. Thank you.
 My name is Sue Pritzker, and I've been the head of school at Child Peace Montessori School for 30 years. I've seen the school grow from a group of 25 to a student body of 360, starting at the YWCA on 10th Street, moving to the Pearl District, and then after a bit of a gentrification process, we're all aware of moving to the industrial northwest to a facility that we could manage. Okay.
 I would want to say to you that as a nonprofit and private school, we embrace our urban location. We always have. We've been involved in community service projects wherever we were located. And as a philosophy, a Montessori school is all about inclusion.
 But I've also been part of the Pearl District Neighborhood Association. I was on the Task Force for the Development of the North Park Blocks. I was a member of the Pearl District Development Plan. I've been on all my neighborhood associations. And I know that it took us three years to get approval for a park. So I'm just here to say that I've seen bad things happen in our city when we don't follow process.
 And so I also, I think, come to you conflicted because these are issues we have to deal with. And I'm responsible for 1,000 people every day and the safety, health and safety, and street safety of children and parents. And people who are living on the street are one of our issues. Safety of the bridge is an issue.
 Parking is an issue. Speeding is an issue. All of those things happen with process. And I am saying that I've been involved in not seeing this type of quickness. I know Homer and I know him to be a good person who has really been instrumental in creating great civic projects. But I've been
 I would say to you, let's not go from the elimination of the 7-to-7 solution, where police have not been able to have the ability to help people solve health and safety problems, and then move to something else that is not well thought out, that is not really going to serve the needs of the neighbors or the people living without a home. Thank you.
 Mike, with the micro-community concepts, what I hear from the people behind me is kind of disturbing. Number one is Northwest Portland needs some sort of a relief effort like this. We have an emergency. It's got to go somewhere.
 Northwest Businesses already designed, besides for Homer, Businesses in Northwest designed a relief camp for that spot. He's not the only one that thinks it's a good idea. Business owners and residents of Northwest Portland hired an architect to design it at the same time they were working. I would like to remind the people behind me that in a couple weeks, we're going to shoot 400 tents that I counted in a corridor within two miles. There's 400 tents there. They're going to have to go somewhere.
 They're going to end up downtown. They're going to end up downtown northwest Portland. They're going to be on the streets. They're going to be underneath the viaducts. They're going to be on the streets. We're going to have a more dangerous place than we did
 than we have now. So everybody's coming up with these new solutions. They're saying come up with this and come up with that. Where have they been for the last four years that we've been talking about this problem? They don't want it in their backyard. Lentz doesn't want it in their backyard. Northeast Portland doesn't want it in their backyard. Southwest Portland doesn't want it in their backyard. But each one of those sectors needs something like this. We've got thousands and thousands of homeless people out there that are chronic victims.
 A lot of people aren't going to go there to T1, but a lot of people will. And the people that do go there are the ones that are going to need it most. I say to turn this down is to say to the private sector, we don't care what you want. We want to keep these people out of our city, out of this part of the city at least anyway. So I urge you to let this private sector...
 work together with the community, which they attended our meeting last night. That wasn't the first meeting that they've attended. They've brought our coalition, at least I thought, together to help them. They have built a coalition. I understand these guys behind us. They have good reason to fear, but I'm trying to let them know now it's going to be much worse if we don't open T1.
 Thank you. Thank you very much. Okay, let's take the next group. The next three are Chloe Utile, Adam Havens, and Jim Howell. And then there are 12 more people left. The next three will be Bob Sollinger, Bob, and Sally Augustin. Okay, if your name's been called and there's a vacant seat, come on up and take it. And we'll let you start, Chloe, please. All right. My name's Chloe Utile. I'm a Portland resident, a small business owner, and a candidate for city council.
 I'm here today as a formerly homeless teen, a currently cost burden renter, and a housing advocate to voice my strong opposition to the lease of Terminal 1 for the eventual purpose of creating a mass homeless shelter. I'm reserving judgment on its use as a temporary emergency shelter for the winter. There's no single solution to a problem that has multiple causes in a population with widely varying needs.
 And even if you build it, they will not all come. So what happens when we put all our eggs into this basket? We still have hundreds of people sleeping on the street and others becoming homeless every day. We have a city that's desperate for solutions. We have a business community ready to contribute considerable sum of money and a wealth of knowledge and experience among our housing advocates and activists that has not begun to be tapped in this process.
 We need a plan for getting people off the streets and into housing that gives them dignity, autonomy, and choices that are appropriate to their needs and circumstances, which I argue T1 is not. We also have thousands of Portlanders who are one rent increase or no-cause eviction away from losing their housing, such as the complex in Hazelwood where residents recently received the choice of a 50% rent increase or a no-cause 90-day eviction.
 None of them can afford the increase, and none of them have anywhere to go. That's 30 more people potentially becoming homeless, including 12 children. Any action we take on homelessness must coincide with meaningful effort to stem the tide of people entering our homeless population due to displacement, through stronger tenant protections, and rent subsidies for cost-burdened households.
 I hope we can find the way to combine the talent and resources that the development team here is offering with a better plan that will allow us to address our short-term emergency without compromising our investment in a better future for all of us. Thank you. You're welcome. Hello, my name is Jim Howell. Thanks for hanging me out. My message here at Moore is for Homer Williams and you folks, but I...
 I'm suggesting that Wapato Jail is not necessarily a bad location. Here are the reasons that have been given for not using Wapato. And probably the most critical one is accessibility issues.
 I know this is one of the reasons that it has not been looked at too seriously, but it could be probably an extremely accessible site. Here it is. I know a lot of people don't know where Wapago is, but you can see it's right next to Rivergate Industrial Area and Terminal 6. Its neighborhood is industry, and the industries out there would love to have better bus service facilities.
 That's something they've been trying to get TriMet to do for a long time. By extending...
 The existing bus line 75, and by the way, I'm a transit person. I'm a housing advocate. But by extending the line 75, which is a crosstown frequent service bus line, which crosses every light rail line and 20 bus lines, eight of which are frequent service, provides excellent access to most of Portland.
 If we just extended that line about five miles out to Wapato. And in the process, it would give Rivergate and that whole industrial area excellent frequent bus service, something they sorely needed and have been asking for. They have now a bus line as well.
 Quite frankly, virtually useless. I think it carries about 140 people a day. Here would be an opportunity to combine good bus service to the industrial area and to that facility. And it shows where that route goes. It goes all the way from St. John's down to Milwaukee. Thank you, Jim. I just wanted to show you, there's Wapato Jail.
 A lot of people don't know what it is, but you can see there's an awful lot of vacant land around there that could be used for the homeless. And it has, as you know, many dormitories that are heated, has plumbing and ventilation, and those things are unique. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks very much. Okay. Let's take the next group, please. Are Bob Sollinger and Bob and Sally Augustine – I'm not –
 OK, and we'll go with Andre Baugh.
 Good afternoon. My name is Bob Salinger. I'm the conservation director for the Portland Audubon Society. And Audubon supports aggressive prioritization of addressing homelessness and houselessness in this city. We supported that for a long time. We do not support this proposal. We think this is a very bad idea. We think that the city council has not done the due diligence it needs to do in order to inform itself and the public about the implications of this decision.
 and we think it is inconsistent with a tremendous amount of work that's gone on in recent years that is also very important. I'll start with the comprehensive plan. The comprehensive plan, the ink isn't even dry on it. One of the most contentious issues was the lack of industrial land, and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of stakeholders worked for years to come up with a solution to our industrial land deficit, especially along the river. We solved that issue. This proposal...
 We'll completely undercut that solution. It will take one of the most valuable pieces of industrial land out of commission, put you in a deficit, and I do not believe you'll be able to get the comprehensive plan and the economic opportunities analysis through the state of Oregon. You're going to have to go back to the drawing board. The implications are that you're going to have to roll back environmental regulations and develop prime wildlife habitat like Hayden Island.
 Number two, you just came through a contentiously contentious referendum about Bureau of Environmental Services for misspending or allegedly misspending BES funds. This makes those mis-expenditures look minor. This is a completely inappropriate use of ratepayer funds, and you ought to be up front with the public about how you're going to repay that.
 The environmental implications, the economic implications are tremendous on this, and you just simply haven't looked at that. Furthermore, the site is also contaminated, and the idea of putting homeless and houseless people on a contaminated site is completely inappropriate. These sites take a long time to clean up and to make safe, and the idea that you can do this quickly is not realistic. Thank you. Thank you. Welcome.
 Hi, my name is Bob Augustin, and my wife Sally and I are property owners of a small warehouse office building about a half a mile north of the proposed site. We are against...
 and urge you to not go forward with this plan for all of the reasons that have already been conveyed. I think that the op-ed of Nick Fish of August 7th summed up the reasons not to go forward with this. The biggest one, though, for me is the lack of due diligence.
 that we seem to be moving to a rush to decision before you properly analyze and look at all possibilities. And I think that Mr. Williams should put forth a full detailed proposal that then has public comment
 input from all of the parties that have been here today, but also announcements to go out so that property owners and tenants can share their input as well. We've had a long-term tenant,
 And he and his wife have expressed concern whether they will stay. So what will this potentially do to property values in the area and the tenants that will be there? And I think there's just a lot of unknowns that require answers before a full decision can be made about,
 If you're unsure how you're voting, then as a fallback position to consider tabling this measure until more input can be received. Thank you very much for your time. Thank you. Welcome. Welcome. Mayor, Council, Andre Baugh, Plain Sustainability Commission Vice Chair. But today I'm here as I'm not speaking for the commission, just as a citizen. And I want to speak to the long-term...
 of terminal one um one long term if it is going to become long-term affordable housing or housing for the homeless that's a conditional use relative to the comp plan that is a type three you would need to show available lands relative to the jobs first it transfers from
 industrial to housing. Housing land is more valuable than industrial land. So you value it today as industrial land, and I'm not going to argue that, but long term it would become housing. I believe housing land is a little more valuable, especially waterfront land, than industrial land.
 the second part of that is goal 9 as a psc we struggled with meeting goal 9 and i know you did too through the comp plan and you raised the the cargo from low to medium in looking at that jobs category
 Through the type three, you would need to prove that, again, in looking at how you're going to meet those jobs with an increased deficit. And so while I'm very supportive of doing something for the homeless, and I think that's a top priority, I encourage you to think about the long term. As you look at the short-term problem you're trying to solve today, to look at the long term and think,
 about it and make sure you understand the implications because the short-term
 Does it solve that long-term problem? Thank you. Thank you all. Just a moment for process check here. I said we were going to take a break at 1, but we are down, I believe, to the last eight people on the sign-up sheet. So if the councils can be a little more exercised, even more endurance than we always do, my suggestion is let's hear from those folks and then take a break until 2 o'clock and start our deliberations then. So we give everybody a chance because people have been waiting to be heard, give them a chance to be heard, and then take our break.
 So let's proceed, and then we'll stop and take a break until 2 o'clock. The next three are Zoe Huxtable, Bev Logan, and Marion Haynes. How about Jesse Sponberg? Welcome. Good afternoon. Mary Hales and Commissioners, I'm Beverly Logan, a leader with Metropolitan Alliance for Common Good, MACG. We want to state strongly on the record that we support this only as a
 We also want to express some of our concerns and ask for measures to ensure that this will, in fact, be temporary, transitional, and transparent. We're concerned that homeless people facing impending sweeps have other places in which they may immediately situate themselves. We're concerned that pressure to find good solutions will diminish if the homeless are simply moved out of sight.
 We're concerned that public money spent on literally warehousing homeless people will not only maintain the status quo for them and for our city, but that money will be diverted from providing true transitional and permanent affordable housing that is healthy, safe, and secure. We're concerned that those most knowledgeable about the problems and solutions of homelessness are opposed to the proposed long-term project.
 And importantly, we're concerned that the step you may approve today will not be a temporary measure to buy time to develop promising long-term solutions, but really a de facto first step towards a particular permanent project that may become inevitable once today's step is taken, even though that project requiring public funds has not been properly vetted or approved by the public. Okay.
 We appreciate any good intentions of Dame and Williams. We also appreciate the distress of neighborhoods. And we can appreciate the pressures that you must fill to address the competing needs in our community. But we must appreciate most the needs of those people actually experiencing homelessness. From their longtime advocates, we understand that the warehousing of homeless people tends only to lock them into warehousing and into continued homelessness.
 We have not had nearly enough time to meaningfully understand or respond to the full proposed project envisioned by Damon Williams until the community has had a reasonable time to consider its long-term implications. We ask for council's commitment to ensure that what passes today, if it does, is truly temporary. And if I could just take a couple seconds to make two specific requests. Okay.
 We ask and expect that you'll develop further plans for permanent, sustainable, restorative solutions to our homelessness and affordable housing crises, and that those plans be responsive to public testimony, be accountable, and be transparent in all phases. And we ask that the proposal, if it passes, that the city make a report on T1 to the public and hold a public hearing at least every six months.
 30 days prior to any renewal of this temporary use of T1. And we look forward to working with you on solutions to the housing crisis that threatens the neighbors and the city that we love. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Sponberg, I think you're next. Go ahead. Hey, how are you, sister? Long time no see. My former student. Hey, guys. My name is Jesse Sponberg. I'm just a regular dude. I do a lot of work with the unhoused communities. And...
 I've been to a lot of city council meetings where we deal with this, and this has to be the most preposterous idea that I've ever heard come out of this council or the previous one. So we have this giant track record of making bad decisions and coming up with projects that don't work, and then we reverse them, and we keep changing our course, and then we do this and we do that. So I got a great idea. Since nothing else works, let's throw $100 million at it.
 Let's economically sequester these people. Let's put them in concentration camps where 400 people who historically cannot cohabitate with each other, that's why they live in bushes and under bridges. So let's stuff them all in a place together. So there's a weird intersectional problem here that hits on a lot of things that I care about. One is our rate payers, our water rate payers. Could you imagine if John DeLorenzo and Kent Crayford had this kind of ammunition?
 When I just helped protect the water bureau from those guys. Okay. What happens when 400 people decide they don't want to live in a warehouse where people have unwashed socks, stinky feet, bed bugs, lice, farting, burping. Then when nobody wants to live there and there's now only 50 people living in that $100 million thing. How are we going to protect that investment? Through criminalizing people.
 and oppressing people even further through our already understaffed police. I beg you guys, you can smell a rat coming down the street. It's nice that we can find $100 million for this, but this is the wrong problem. Do you know the only place in Portland that doesn't have any crime is Hazelnut Grove? That's the only place in this whole city with no crime is Hazelnut Grove. We have 96 neighborhood associations, and for easy math, let's say that we have 300 unhoused people.
 Each neighborhood association identifies one plot of land where we can set up an intentional micro-community, just like Hazelnut Grove. Self-policed, mostly self-funded. The city, metro, and the county work together to get garbage services, outhouse services. And these people can live. You know, you can't just take somebody because they're poor and put them in a warehouse. That's inhumane. That's criminalizing homelessness because...
 There is a prison. I mean, whether it has bars on the windows or whether it's a place that the cops will force you to go. I beg you guys, not on my behalf, on the behalf of the people that actually are living in a tent whose only crime is trying not to die in this city. Please don't lock them up. I mean, please don't put them in a warehouse. It's going to lead to criminalizing them even worse. Thank you guys for listening and thank you for all your hard work. I know this is not an easy solution. Thank you. Thank you.
 Good afternoon. Good afternoon, Mayor Hales. Commission members, my name is Mary. Move a little closer to the mic. My name is Marion Haynes. I'm the Vice President of the Portland Business Alliance. As you know, we've advocated for more emergency shelters so that those living on our streets have a safe indoor place to sleep. We also for many years have highlighted the need for industrial land in this city, which provides opportunities for quality middle-income jobs and allows people to afford to live in homes
 a growing cost city like Portland. Our community has an urgent need for both emergency shelters and industrial land. As public and private sector leaders, we have a responsibility to address these shortages by providing both. There's no need, in our view, to pit a homeless shelter and industrial land against one another. We don't know why it's become quite this level of dispute. Thank you.
 We don't believe it makes sense to rush forward today with the decision about Terminal 1 or even which bureau should control the site before bid results for the site are evaluated next week, especially considering that the bid period closes in just five days. We strongly urge you to set over today's vote for at least 30 days to give all a chance to evaluate whether this property can be sold for industrial use and the time frame in which it might be deployed.
 as we've said to many of you prior to this hearing there may be an opportunity to do a temporary short-term facility for the cold winter months on that site even if it does have a sale pending it would be unlikely that somebody would be developing that site immediately if a sale were to go through and there is an opportunity to do something for those who need it in a very immediate sense
 We'd like to thank Homer Williams for bringing forward the model for Haven for Hope. We actually had some people that went down and toured it a number of months ago. It's worthy of consideration. We think that it needs to be fit to be more of a Portland model. And I think you've heard some of the concerns about that here.
 But when it comes to determining a permanent location for a facility like that, limiting it to just one site isn't the right answer. There's many publicly owned buildings and parcels of land in the city in Multnomah County. We've repeatedly asked for a centralized inventory so that we can understand where those unused and underutilized properties are and have a conversation about how best to deploy those to deal with the crisis that we have. It's really time to get this inventory and start discussing it publicly.
 We brought sites to the city and county and sat with folks from home everyone to try to identify opportunities and options. And we are prepared to stay at the table and do that. But making a decision today to eliminate one of the few available industrial job sites in this city before understanding all the facts doesn't make any sense. We need shelter capacity and we need middle income jobs. And we just don't think that we need to be in a position where we're choosing one or the other. We can figure out how to do both. Thank you.
 Thanks. Before you leave, I want to introduce you to Chad Stover, who's been on my staff for three and a half years and who has that inventory. So I want to make sure I connect you two. So get a copy from him. Any other questions for these folks? Thank you. Next. Are Alec Horley, Aikila Lowe, and Ted Timmons? And the last person I show is Doug Bennett. Welcome. Good day. I'm trying to keep him asleep. This is Charles. I'm Alec Horley. I wanted to come here today to talk about the work that's been done on the project. And I'm going to
 for numerous reasons but i think what has been said i agree with a lot what i want to state is that i think one or a couple of you should walk down 14th avenue from nato to 14th i am a staunch pedestrian i have a car my wife and i share one car i'm a portland streetcar annual pass holder
 um it's one of the reasons why you're my favorite mayor ever charlie thank you um i like that choo-choo charlie name it sticks it's just charles we're just doing charles but um so basically uh when you walk down 14th you'll see that those buildings that have been authorized to go higher to accommodate more people coming into portland have a lot of children
 standing right outside of that front door of those complexes, waiting for the Chapman School bus to come pick them up. And there's a lot of kids there. We see them in the morning because I walk from my home. I didn't even state this. I live in Riverscape. But I walk right by the Ramona. We play in the park. I wouldn't want the Ramona apartments to know this, but we play in the park that's in the middle of the Ramona building. And there are numerous apartment buildings that scatter through there.
 If I was willing to do a study, I would come and if I was to come to an assumption, I would say that almost half of the people from this facility would be walking from that NATO down 14th. I mean, NATO to 14th and then cut through 14th and then wiggle their way to the services in Northwest, inner Northwest near Burnside. And so just doing a study and reviewing and taking a look at what that impact is at that time in the morning, right when people wake up.
 What's that going to be? What is that going to be like, that infusion of stream of people coming through those neighborhoods? Thank you. Thanks very much. Welcome. You woke up already, so I guess I'm good. My name is Ted Timmons. I live in Northwest. I don't know that Terminal 1 is the right thing to do or not. I sent some notes in, so you've got my free form notes. Amanda and I emailed back and forth a few times, which was great. I'm not sure if it's the right thing to do. It's a lot of people.
 What I am really upset about is to see the response from some of my neighbors and from some of the other people here in Portland of, you know, they need to stay out of our area. You know, what about somewhere else? This is going to affect my property values. You know, the industrial space is more important than housing people that are going to be swept off the Springwater Corridor. So I don't think that a huge shelter is the way to go. Right.
 But we're really in a tough position right here. And that's, I think, a much more important issue. And I really wish that this would be talked about from the human point of view instead of, you know, what's the zoning? What can we do with the zoning in a state of emergency? What can we, you know, those types of things.
 What about these people that we have that need somewhere to go? If we're going to sweep them off spring water, if we're going to try and make spring water more secure, whatever, what do we do? And Terminal 1, Wapato, I don't know. You get paid money to figure that out. But this is really the issue, is to really address this from that point of view.
 I really, I think that Hazelnut's been a success. I think that most people consider that a great kind of, you know, immediate step. And these kind of small self-organized communities, I think, are great. It's, you know, it takes care of some of the concerns about, gee, there's a lot of people in one place. And, you know, how do we regulate it and all of that? Sure, it's not the, you know, what should be done long term, but yeah.
 It seems to work. Why don't we have these 30-person camps in all 95 of our neighborhoods? That's almost 3,000 people, every neighborhood, including mine, including everyone else's. So that's where I come from on it. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you both. I thank all three of you. Anyone left? That's all who signed up. Okay. Okay, is there some folks that came in that still want to speak? Let's take the last group. If you were on the list and you didn't hear your name, if you've signed up. Come on up.
 And then we'll take a break. Welcome. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. My name is Zoe Huxtable. And I have a degree from NCNM as a naturopathic doctor and a degree from PSU as an engineer. And Salvation Army and CPI staff and clients wanted me to come here today and speak. But I'm here speaking for myself. So...
 Within the Salvation Army SAFEs and the TPI SOS, there are limited laundry facilities, and it's discouraged for women to go to TPI to use the laundry. That's kind of not—it's unofficially reserved for men who really have gotten kicked out of practically everywhere and aren't welcome to go much of any place.
 But there is competition within the community in private businesses for washers and dryers. I mean, other people within community apartments or in houses also want to use that spot and they don't like. They're not really comfortable with people less homeless than them.
 or excuse me, more homeless than them as they perceive using the washers and dryers. And also there's a conflict with TriMet busing or maxing dirty laundry to the laundromat. So that's one issue. Also, there's an issue of so many people, competition for showers within, let's say, for instance, the Salvation Army.
 And then there's people who don't have a bed or a mat at the Salvation Army who maybe are sleeping in a park or spring water or somewhere coming in to take a shower. So they wanted me to bring that up as well. And I don't really want to speak too much on someone else's business and what may or may not happen, but I think it's great if...
 if whatever passes, if anything passes, that the problems that the shelters are having now, if the solutions can be included within whatever shelter or whatever solution is passed for housing people this winter.
 so that they don't, new shelters don't have the same problem, or create more to the problem with the people on the buses, with dirty laundry. And then someone mentioned porta-potties. I remember in the past, I'm not against housing homeless at all. I think it's great that people are caring and loving for their neighbor to provide housing for people, instead of letting people die from freezing to death, et cetera. But with the porta-potties, I know...
 and the limited laundry and limited toilets. And then, you know, there's been a problem in the past with people going to public libraries smelling of poop or urine and feces in the public libraries, and then they were discriminated against for smelling so bad, et cetera. So please include that stuff in the new shelter. That's very helpful. That's very practical. Thank you. Okay, thank you. Welcome. I'm Doug Bennett. I am.
 member of the Village Coalition, but I haven't been assigned to speak for them. I want to make that clear. I am in homeless camp at least once a week, and I live downtown Portland, and I walk outside my building, and at least once a week I walk out of my building to see a man urinating on the wall right near me.
 the door of my building. And in the homeless camps down on the corridor, I know personally the rats, and I'm talking about the little critters with the long tail. And we... I'm begging that you proclaim a state of civil emergency like Seattle did. Half, actually. Okay. And then...
 these rules and these laws that you keep trying to enforce, they're no longer valid. We have, in a short time, your health authorities are going to report to the World Health Organization, and the World Health Organization is going to say, what were you thinking?
 Every plague in the history of mankind started because there was not property, toilets, and water provided for people.
 We have to get either the people to the water, toilets, and land, or get the toilets and the water to the people. One or the other now. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. I want to thank you all. A lot of excellent testimony. We appreciate it. We're going to take a break for just about 45 minutes and then reconvene the council at 2 o'clock. Thank you.
 Okay, Council will return to order. Would you please call the roll? Saltzman? Here. Novick? Here. Fritt? Here. Fish? Here. Hales? Here. Okay, we completed a long public hearing this morning on these items. We have amendments before us. We may have questions of staff. Let's maybe start with questions of staff. Are there any?
 Does anyone need folks to come up and respond to any of what we heard? Oh, we don't have a city attorney. Oh, I think we will. We have at least some of them in the room. Are you posing as the city attorney today, young man? Oh, okay. I don't want that. Okay. I have a question. Okay. So we have the housing director here and the city attorney. So questions? Thank you. What infrastructure is there in the warehouse right now? Is there plumbing? No.
 I think there's overhead lighting, some sort of spot heating overhead. Also, I don't know to what extent there's any plumbing in the building. I've not physically been in the building. So you wouldn't be able to do any kind of...
 permanent plumbing. So are you envisioning bringing in, like, FEMA-type trucks to provide showers and laundry as well as the porta-potties? We've looked at some of those options. Actually, the Joint Base Lewis-McChord has some military facilities
 vehicles that are already pre-wired for that purpose, and so we looked at buying some of those on a surplus market from the U.S. government. And how much are they? I can't give you a direct quote offhand, but we've seen an advertised number of $30,000 a unit for the packaged contained units, but those would have to be transported and then installed, which would be an additional cost. Installed in what way? They'd have to be hooked up to fire hydrants for water supply. Okay.
 is there a hydrant near there's fire there's fire protection on the property as a sprinkler system yes okay other questions for kurt kurt the uh mr director yes uh uh what what uh just to clarify because jr saltzman in his opening remarks said this would be privately funded for the next six months what is the anticipated public investment in this uh mass shelter well the lease rate
 when it's determined by council, would likely be a public cost because the Bureau would enter into a lease agreement with the Bureau of Environmental Services. That figure is going to run anywhere from, it sounds like, $10,000 to $30,000 a month, however the council decides.
 We don't expect additional costs over and above that. There will be staff time that is currently Jennifer Chang and myself that will likely be working with Mark Jolin and the Joint Office of Homeless Services to further refine the...
 program, the service levels to be provided by the operators. Jennifer and I have been working on a draft budget. We think a shelter of this magnitude will cost between $2 million and $3 million a year to operate in personnel costs, and that may be further augmented by the
 contributions that Mr. Williams has talked about with respect to behavioral health and medical services. But at least for purposes of this proposal, the operating costs would be exclusively borne by the private operator? That is our understanding. And has the private operator indicated who they would select to actually run the shelter?
 Well, what we've understood, and this goes to the deeper question of the CET application that we've prepared to submit to Metro, which is very much a programming, that would be,
 For those people watching this, it's construction excise tax that Oregon Metro is making available on a competitive basis, and applications are due in September. That would essentially allow us the necessary funding.
 money to do the programming and design the program. The Union Gospel Mission and Right to Dream, too, have both been mentioned as essential partners in this effort. Who the actual vendors are and how many of them are to be included is yet to be determined. And what role will the Housing Bureau have in selecting a qualified entity to provide the services? Thank you.
 Our goal would be to set the service standards and the evaluation tool and to ensure that the city is held harmless from any risk associated with the operation. We would prefer that the Oregon Trail for Hope actually select the operator directly themselves so that we don't have a business relationship or identity of interest with the operators. We'll set the standards and we'll measure the outcomes. Thank you.
 Other questions for Kurt? No. I didn't have a question. Okay. Statement. All right. Anything else before we proceed? All right. Then let's take a vote, please, on the resolution.
 I'm sorry, the amendments are opposed to the resolution and the second item. I'm sorry, so we have to take up the amendments first. So we have a package of amendments that Commissioner Fish introduced. Let's take a vote on those unless there's a need for any further discussion of those, and then we'll turn to Commissioner Fritz's amendment. Is that all right? All right, let's take Commissioner Fish's amendments first. Self-Assembling? Well, I want to take this chance to say that I deeply respect the
 all the viewpoints that have been expressed today about the proposal for a temporary shelter at the location of Terminal 1. I was struck by two statements from the public, one sort of at the beginning and one towards the end. Dave Huff, or Dave Hoff, near the beginning said, This problem of homelessness needs a big vision. Ted Timmons, who I think was our last testifier, said, Humanize the issue. We need to humanize the issue.
 And I absolutely agree. I mean, the problem of homelessness in our community is enormous. It's enormous in every city in this country. And we need to find ways to do things a little differently. And I think that the proposed vision that we're going to allow by taking a baby step, hopefully, today, by authorizing a six-month temporary lease that could at least be up and running by the wintertime or people over the winter.
 is what we need to do. And I would respectfully urge, and I appreciate the diverse viewpoints of my colleagues on this matter. We're all just trying to do our jobs. We're all trying to do the jobs the best way we know how to do them, and that's by listening and also by taking action. As somebody said, we're the ones that make the decisions, and that's true, and that's what we're doing here today. I will respectfully ask my colleagues to vote against all the amendments. I do believe that there's undue time
 expense associated with the amendments, and that's why I would respectfully urge a no vote on those amendments. But I do think, as I said, I respect my colleague, Commissioner Fish, Commissioner Fritz, all my colleagues, and I respect everybody who spent time here today talking to us. And I want to say I have a deep respect for Homer Williams and him walking this gangplank, too. There's a lot of expectations on him, on us, and I think if we take the baby step of authorizing this six-month lease...
 we will start making some differences. So as to the amendments, I vote no. Novick. I'm going to hold my comments on the broader issue until we vote on the resolution itself. I'm going to respectfully vote against the amendments. However, I do want to note that, as I think Director Krieger just suggested, the issue of the amount of the lease payment is...
 It has not been determined. What the resolution itself says is no less than $10,000 a month, and we'll cover BS expenses. I think that we'll have a discussion about how to define expenses. I think that Director Krieger's suggestion that the amount of the lease should be informed by the offers that we get on the property, which close in a few days, I think was reasonable, and I expect for Council to have further discussion about the lease amount after we've had a chance to review those offers. No. Okay.
 Commissioner Fish has done yeoman's work over the past almost four years to bring order to the utilities and to make sure that every single penny is spent appropriately of ratepayers' money and of general fund money. And I think his, I know his amendments would greatly improve the proposal. Aye. Yes. The amendments which I proposed were designed to protect ratepayer interests, ensure adequate notice,
 provide what I would call a minimum of community oversight of this project I regret that my colleagues at this moment have chosen to reject them I think we're entering uncharted waters here respectfully I think we're making a mistake and I vote aye yes I share Commissioner fish's concern about making sure that we hold to the high ground that we've worked hard to get to and that is we no longer spend utility money in any way that's questionable
 Notice I said we no longer spend utility money in any way that's questionable. And I believe in that as both a matter of principle and as a matter of law. That does not, however, mean that a bureau is entitled to the maximum possible rate of return from a general fund bureau that might be leasing its property, in my opinion.
 So I'm going to be very interested in returning to this question later, as Commissioner Novick noted. When we find out what the market thinks this property is worth, that will inform our work. And if there are legitimate expenses that a ratepayer-funded bureau, in this case the Bureau of Environmental Services, has borne that ought to be reimbursed by the general fund, then I'm going to be in favor of doing that.
 So I'm interested in returning to that question because we're clean on this issue as a city. I'm proud of that and we're going to stay clean on that issue and not spend ratepayer money on housing and homelessness as important as this priority is. So we don't need to pass this amendment in order to hew to that principle, but we do need to do some careful accounting and square up as is needed later on. But I don't see that we need to adopt these amendments in order to do that. No. No.
 Okay, let's take up Commissioner Fritz's amendment then, please. Saltzman? Well, I appreciate Commissioner Fritz's amendment, but I do believe, and there is no expenditure of general fund resources other than was stated for the lease payment for the Housing Bureau from the Bureau of Environmental Services.
 That's the only general fund in vision for this commitment. But I'm hesitant because this is a big vision, and we're taking it in baby steps. I'm hesitant to sort of lock us in and tie our hands prospectively. So I respectfully vote no. No, Vic. No. Fritz. This amendment merely says that no general fund money shall be spent on improvements or operations of the temporary shelter. I think that's what I just heard, so I don't understand why my colleagues are voting against it. I vote aye.
 Well, I'm going to support this amendment, but I will also hold my colleague to his word that the private sector will cover the costs of the shelter. That was in his opening statement. And it seemed to me that it is ironic here that it is usually Commissioner Saltzman who brings these kinds of amendments to bring clarity about how we use general fund dollars. But if the council thinks, Dan, in terms of the comments you've made in the record, they're so clear we don't need the amendment, so be it. But I support the amendment. Aye. Nails. No.
 Okay, and on the resolution itself? Councilman? Well, I think I've made my opening statement on the First Amendment vote. So I just want to say again how much work remains ahead of us. We have to iron out a use agreement with Haven Trail of Hope, and much work remains to be done, and it will be done in the full light of day. And the public will have the chance to see each step of the way as we develop this relationship. Okay.
 and develop a much-needed, at least temporary, shelter capacity that will get us through the winter. And I think this is a good step, and I thank my colleagues for the deliberations today, and I'm pleased to vote aye.
 I really appreciate everyone's thoughtful testimony today. And I have to say that I find myself today in much the same position I was in some months ago when we voted on reciting the Right to Dream II. At that time, folks from the Central Eastside Industrial District had some, I thought, very cogent arguments for why that site was inappropriate. At the time, Commissioner Fish was persuaded of those arguments and voted no.
 I think I said at the time that I agree this is a tough choice. I think there's good arguments against using this site. But my colleagues, Commissioner Fritz and the mayor, had spent many, many months before that looking for alternate sites, and they concluded that that was the best one. So I voted yes.
 I'm in a similar situation here. I think that there are excellent arguments, including of course the fact that it is an industrial site that would like to be used for industrial purposes against siting a facility at Terminal 1. But I also think there are better arguments against allowing people to continue to sleep in the street. I realize people have questions about Mr. Williams and his colleagues' ability to actually
 motivate the resources to make this happen, and that's a discussion that he's going to have with the Housing Bureau in the coming weeks. I think it's important to give Mr. Williams and the Housing Bureau a chance to make this happen, a chance to see an expansion of our capacity to help homeless people with private money, and the with private money thing is important. And I also do think there is some urgency because it would be nice if we actually had a facility up and running before the cold weather hits.
 I've heard a lot of people say, well, there must be a bunch of other sites. And the Mercury, I think, recently published a list of 120 sites that the mayor has looked at over there and the housing bureau looked at in the past year.
 I actually called Josh Alpert over the weekend and I figured he's no longer with the city, he can speak freely, and asked him, are there better sites than Terminal 1 for homeless shelters that we know were better but we dismissed them for political reasons? He said, no. We went through a lot of sites. Terminal 1 was actually always high on our list.
 I've heard people talk about Wapato. And actually, I have to tell you, I have some personal history with Wapato, which makes me really wish that there was some constructive use to which it should be put. I happened to be working for Diane Lynn some 15 years ago, and I advised her not to build it, because I didn't think that we would have the money to operate it. And I didn't succeed. It's one of my major public policy failures in the state of Oregon.
 So I would like there to be a constructive use of that site, and I realize that there are objections to Wapato, it's too far away, et cetera, but it was actually built for people to live in. So if somebody comes to us in the next few weeks and says,
 we have a plan for operating wapato we've raised the money to do it we've got at least as good a plan for operating wapato as homer williams has for operating terminal one and the county has bought into it and since we're really opposed to terminal one we'll only do wapato terminal one doesn't happen i'm would be opening to listening to that argument
 I have suggested looking into Memorial Coliseum, which is an underutilized city asset, as a homeless shelter. It's fairly centrally located, has transit, bathrooms, showers, et cetera. It's my understanding that the city has had discussions with the trailblazers that sort of have the operating rights to that facility about that, and the blazers were willing to listen, but given their contractual obligations to other users, that's not something that could happen soon.
 If somebody who is opposed to using Terminal 1 has a different conversation with the Blazers and comes forward with the resources to make that operate instead of Terminal 1, again, I'd be interested in hearing that proposal.
 I think that it's important to move forward today, understanding that we don't have all the I's dotted and the T's crossed, in order to give Mr. Williams and the Housing Bureau an opportunity to make something happen before the cold weather hits. It may be that they won't succeed, but I don't want to stand in the way of giving them that opportunity, and because summer is waning, I think it is important to act today.
 As I said before, I think that the issue of the lease amount is something that needs further discussion. Again, I really, really appreciate everybody's testimony, and I'm not voting yes because I think the arguments against using Terminal 1 are bad arguments. I'm voting yes because I think that we are not in the position in this state of homeless emergency to look a gift horse in the mouth. So I vote aye. Great. Thanks.
 I have been working with Right to Dream 2 for over two years to find a new spot for them, and we found one. And we had a public hearing on it. We have had lots of process. We got a zoning confirmation letter. We know that the property is suitable for the proposed use.
 And then since we got that decided, we've been working with the community, the houseless community, to see what they want on the property. And that's one of the reasons it's taking a long time. We are looking at how do we provide showers and bathroom facilities to people living in the central east side who maybe there isn't room for at Right to Dream 2. And so I know that there's a lot of planning and programming that needs to happen and permits. Thank you.
 to get something like this cited, even if we wanted to just go right ahead and not consult with people in the houseless community. But I think we should. Nothing about us without us. There are, and as part of that search for the Right to Dream 2 property, I personally looked at dozens of properties. I suggested one to commissioners...
 Saltzman last week that we rejected for Right to Dream 2 because the cost was $100,000 a year. And Right to Dream didn't want to use their trust for something that would be temporary. So it's less expensive than Right to Dream 2.
 the proposed use at Terminal 1. There's also another site further down on NATO that's not river-dependent that we looked at, which again, yes, there isn't room for 400 people, but there's certainly room for some of the self-organized and appropriately sized groups that we want to encourage and facilitate. And I'm grateful to the people living outside at Right to Dream 2 and those at Hazelnut Grove who have shown that that model works
 We've heard about the place in Texas where it doesn't work to have hundreds of people all together. I want to read something that Israel Baer of Street Roots wrote in this week's copy. He wasn't referencing this particular site, so I want to read it as my commentary as well as his. His title is, Homelessness Isn't a Media Event, It's Real Life.
 It sucks to be homeless. Some people think it's easy in Portland. They are wrong. Nobody is choosing to be homeless because they don't want to go to a shelter. Seriously, would you? Living in a shelter stinks, literally. It's uncomfortable. It's loud. It's overwhelming to someone with a trauma or living with a mental illness. Want to be able to sleep with the one you love? Too bad. Need some time alone to think? Sorry. Want to be not treated like a child or you're in jail? Good luck.
 Israel says,
 2,000 people didn't just decide to be homeless just to create a media spectacle or piss off the larger community. People are sleeping on our streets are human beings. They are our fellow human beings struggling to maintain in a world gone mad, a world without a safe place to call home. It's as simple as that. If we are going to get $100 million from private individuals,
 contributors, we should be putting it into ongoing housing and not into a mass shelter. I worked for 22 years at OHSU on inpatient psychiatry. We had 20 people living there and five staff to take care of us, plus security constantly on call.
 To think that this kind of a mass shelter on a contaminated place that the DEQ has said is not safe for residential use, never mind for people living in tents, is preposterous, as Jesse Spahnberg said. Then we get to the zoning code issue. The property is zoned river industrial. It's valuable industrial land that will create family wage jobs if we allow it to be sold and developed and recoup the ratepayers' investment.
 In the recent comprehensive plan debates, industrial land supply was one of the biggest sticking points. Taking 14 acres out of the industrial land supply will throw the delicate balance out of alignment, endangering West Hayden Island and the Gulf course compromise.
 our zoning code prohibits mass shelters in industrial zones when title 15 was amended to allow mass shelters as temporary activities our ordinance declaring a housing emergency spoke only of waiving the zoning code for citing two day storage units and as i have mentioned this one specific part of the zoning code that the title 15 changes did not take out were 33
 296.040 that prohibits any kind of permanent improvements. And yet, permanent improvements are just what 400 people are going to need. The concept of waiting to use a FEMA shower
 with so many other people, it might be able to do it for a few days after the big one, but for six months over the winter, this is not like what Mayor Hales did at the Sears shelter over last winter, where a neighborhood in Southwest did in fact come together and recognize that these are our fellow human beings.
 And if this site moves forward, I hope that the folks we've heard from in nearby housing will recognize that, as was noted, most people who live outside are not dangerous. Most people outside are very vulnerable. And that's one of the reasons I think this is a very, very bad idea, because vulnerable people should not be put altogether in large warehouses.
 I could go on, but this is not the right approach. I have been working so hard to find solutions, and I'm disappointed that so much money is going to be put into this temporary thing, which is going to put people more at risk. No. Chris? I want to begin by thanking everyone that took a few hours out of their day to come testify and share their views with us.
 It is a privilege to occupy this job as a city commissioner, and it is a special privilege on days like this where we have these kinds of discussions, and I think on balance they bring out the best. Here's what I heard and what I learned today. From the community, I learned that there's overwhelming opposition to this concept. And what struck me and made this different from other debates we've had is that it was a chorus. We heard from housing activists, people in the trenches, environmentalists,
 planners, neighbors, labor leaders, business leaders. We heard from the great broad spectrum of Portland, and with a couple of exceptions, they were united in their opposition to this ill-conceived idea. And I heard them clearly. So let me tell you what I learned from the sponsors as I listened as carefully as I could throughout this day. Here's what I learned about the plan. Here's what I learned about the funding, both public and private.
 Here's what I learned about the city's role in the short term and the long term. Here's what I learned about benchmarks for success and how we can judge this experiment. As you can see, I didn't learn much because very little was shared with us because we're putting the cart before the horse. You know, I usually approach these issues from a values proposition. We were admonished by a number of people who testified to stop being so legalistic or so technical and remember the humanity. And so I think that's good advice.
 For 35 years in my adult life, I've been part of something called the housing movement. And I have never been the brightest bulb, and I have never been the most creative voice, and I have never been the source of the solution. But every day I've been inspired by people who get up committed to ending the national disgrace of homelessness and who believe that everyone has a right to a safe and decent place to call home.
 And it is the reason I ran for office, and it is the reason I have been proud to partner with my colleagues in the last year around this emergency to do things that prior councils have not done. But my values tell me a couple of things about how we do this work. The first is that we do our best work when we link arms and we work together. Next, I believe that the public expects from us that we lay out a vision.
 and that we stick to a plan, and that our touchstone is a long-term, cost-effective, and humane solution to this crisis. And when we declared an emergency, we did not give this council license to just make it up. I thought what we were doing was doubling down on the things that we knew worked. The proposal before us today fails my test of common sense and of humanity. It ignores
 The advice of the pub and the cub are ratepayer advocates. It builds on a failed model of warehousing vulnerable people. It breaks faith with our comprehensive plan, and it sets a bad precedent. And as I mentioned before, it ignores the chorus of voices of people of goodwill who have said no to this half-baked idea. It places a prominent developer in a privileged position
 at the expense of everyone else who played by the rules. And it undermines the hard-won trust that we've gained with our ratepayers. I had the honor of serving with Tom Potter for about six months at the end of his term. He was fond of quoting the great philosopher Lewis Carroll. He said, if you don't know where you're going, any road will get you there. One of Tom's favorite lines. Well, today, by this action, we are making a very big statement, and it is that we are lost. We are lost.
 I don't question my colleagues' motives or their values or their commitment to the fight against homelessness. But today, I question their judgment. No. Hales. Ten months and three days ago, I brought to this council a proposal that we declare a state of housing emergency.
 And as has been mentioned, it's something that we unanimously adopted, and it was not a media event or a re-election ploy either. It was a serious commitment to a real crisis in both housing affordability for lots of people in our community, and we've heard about that again today, and we'll hear about it any time the subject comes up because it is a crisis today.
 and about homelessness, which our city has been struggling with for a long time, and now West Coast cities in particular are struggling with at a whole new level because of all the reasons that have been mentioned. So this is a real thing. We've committed to it, and the crisis is far from over. And I said from the beginning, and I've repeated this, Troika, and it's, I think, still correct, that in a state of emergency, you should see three things. You should see rapid action. You should see real money.
 And you should see deliberate experimentation, trying things. That's what you do in an emergency. And that's what we need to keep doing. We saw that with the Sears shelter. We opened it 45 days after we declared an emergency. And I'm very proud of the fact that my wife and I, along with some people in this room, were there with pumpkin pies on Thanksgiving Day to welcome the 200 women that lived there. So that's what we need to keep doing, rapid action.
 deliberate experimentation, and real money. Now, there are some serious doubts and fears that have been expressed here today, and I take those seriously. But I want to offer some reassurance about those. One is, well, can you really do anything temporary? Does temporary always evolve to permanent? Well, don't listen to my words. Look at what we did. Okay.
 We opened the Sears shelter for six months. We told the neighborhood it would be for six months, and we closed it six months later. We opened the peace shelter that the Menashe family made available to us through their amazing generosity. We opened it as a temporary facility. We kept it open for a while, and then we closed it. We said we would move right to Dream 2, and construction is underway on the new site as we speak.
 There's a big orange machine out there digging trenches for utility lines right now. So what I want to ask of everybody, this council, the people in the community, the people that are here today, is that, yeah, there's a lot of anxiety and some division now because we are moving quickly, because we are trying things, and because we're spending real money at the city and county level. But my really earnest plea to all of us is we need to work together
 We need to take good faith from each other. So when you hear us say we're doing something as an experiment, if it doesn't work, we'll stop. I hope you'll count on those words being true because I mean them and I think we all do. And then we need to expect that of each other, that we go into this crisis in that mode with those understandings. We're going to try some things. We're going to take help wherever we can get it.
 whether it's the Menashe family or the Yimbys, that stood for yes in my backyard, who organized themselves to make sack lunches for the people living in the Sears building, or anybody else, including Mr. Williams and his partners in this venture. So this is worth a try. It doesn't mean that we sleepwalk to a bad place. It means that if this proposal comes together, that it can be run by a responsible operator,
 in a humane way and help solve part of the problem for a while, then we're all better for that, including the people that are sleeping outside and are, frankly, very unwelcome. If there's anything I've learned in working on homelessness, it's that no good deed goes unpunished, but we should keep doing the good deeds and keep trying things.
 So I want to say let's keep trying to work together as a community here, even if this is a divided vote and even if this is a divided House today. Let's do the right thing. Let's make sure we do it the right way. But above all, do something. Thank you, Dan. Aye. Okay, let's move to the next item, which is the proposal to Metro with 924. That's a non-emergency. Oh, that's a non-emergency. Sorry, so that passes the second reading.
 Okay, thank you, everyone. We'll take a momentary break, and then we'll move to our regular agenda. Let's try to move quickly through our regular agenda because we have some folks that are here waiting for what was billed as a 2 p.m. time certain. So we'll try to make at least partially good on that. Let's go to 937, please. Oh, I'm sorry. Have I already rescheduled that, or do I need to gavel that? That's going to be heard later. Okay. Got to read it? Right. No, we'll get it. So it's already moved. So 938 then, please.
 938, authorize an intergovernmental agreement with the City of Gresham for the City of Portland to conduct transit lodging tax audits of Gresham Hotels on behalf of the City of Gresham. Roll call. Schultzman? Aye. Novick? Aye. Fritz? Aye. Fish? Fish. Second reading, Nick. Aye. Hales? Aye. Okay, it's 939. 939.
 Approve application under the multiple unit limited tax exemption program for 17th and Kearney located at 905 Northwest 17th Avenue roll call vote, please Seltzman, I know that I I
 Approve application under the multiple unit limited tax exemption program for 17th and Petty Grove located at 1 3 3 1 Northwest 17th Avenue second meeting roll call vote No 941
 Direct the city engineer to waive city code upon receiving evidence to support a proposal to rename Southwest 9th Avenue from West Burnside Street to Southwest Montgomery Street to Park Avenue and allow the Portland Bureau of Transportation to process the street renaming application in good faith. Commissioner Novick.
 let's say even light at the time can we agree that testimony will limited to one minute on this as far as I'm concerned let's see you know we have somebody here for this oh okay afternoon mayor Hill City Council I know you guys have it a long day I'll be brief as possible
 Early 2016, the Bureau of Transport, I'm sorry, Kurt Kruger with the Portland Bureau of Transportation. Early 2016, we received a street renaming application from TMT Development. They were proposing to rename Southwest 9th Avenue in the central city between Burnside and Montgomery to Southwest Park. Pivot did a cursory review of the code and the application and realized that we couldn't process the application with the limitations that the code presents us with. There are two limitations that
 preventing this application from moving forward. The code asks that a street be renamed by a prominent person, that prominent person be deceased for five years, and that the street be renamed continuously from starting point to ending point. The proposal before us is obviously not for a real person.
 And the proposal is not to actually rename the entire length of Southwest Park Avenue. Park Avenue extends north of Burnside, where it becomes Northwest Park Avenue. And there are a couple very small segments scattered in the West Hills that are obviously not continuous with this request. So the request before you is a resolution to waive the code for those two provisions to allow this application to enter into the process. Yes.
 That process will include a nomination of a historian panel that will review this and make a recommendation to the Portland Planning and Sustainability Commission. The Planning and Sustainability Commission will conduct a hearing, take testimony, and forward a recommendation to city council. City council will then conduct a hearing and determine whether or not the test has been met and if the renaming is approvable. So the request today here is not to rename a street.
 The request is to waive two portions of code to let this application move forward through the process. I've got a small question. I don't want to get bogged down in this, but it's fun to think about something else for a couple minutes here. This process should go forward, obviously, but it seems to me that setting the boundaries in the resolution might be a little restrictive. Just a point of geography. So then PARC will still be PARC?
 If this goes forward from Burnside to Irving and then stop because that's where it would end in the post office property, why not go all the way if we're going to rename most of this street in the downtown core, finish the job with whatever that is, seven more blocks, whatever.
 I just want to throw that out there. I don't know if that's a good idea or not, but I'd like this process to have a little bit of flexibility to consider those possibilities. I agree, Mayor. My understanding is that the proposal is the proposal because this is what people on the street requested. But I think that once we start the process, we could consider something perhaps more comprehensive.
 As long as we're open to that, I don't know if, again, if it's a good idea or not or if the property owners would burn me an effigy for even bringing this up, but just wanted to get it out there. Okay, other questions for Kurt? Is it your intention to at some subsequent time bring an application to rename the streets on either end of this, Madison and Lexington? Okay.
 I see where we're headed here. Yeah, yeah, New York West. We're going to stand up for Portland. That's right. Okay, he's not going to answer that question. He's going to take the fifth. Other questions for Kurt? Thank you very much. Does anyone want to speak on this item today? Okay, come on up. Hi, Council. I'm going to do this. This is Mary Eng, but I might be having a gender change coming up with Mr. Eng signed up later. But I'm going to do this in my southern accent.
 Because I grew up in Tennessee where the streets just start changing. And if you're from out of town and you're on a road and you're driving down along the road, then it suddenly changes and it can be so tremendously confusing. So I do appreciate everything you're doing to make it all very consistent and orderly. I do appreciate that. I just want you to know my hands hurt so much from that arrest, Mr. Hales. Why do you do that to a woman? Cover her with bruises.
 It hurts so bad. Okay, thank you. Further discussion on the resolution? Then a roll call vote, please. Saltzman? Aye. No, thank you. Thank you, Kurt. And actually, Commissioner Fish, I feel your pain because it's always struck me as kind of funny that we have a Broadway and a park as if we were pretending to be New York. But as long as we have something that's part of the way, I see no objection to considering making a park for some amount of the rest of its length.
 fritz aye fish aye tales aye 942 authorize a contract with the lowest responsible bidder for the southwest 19th southwest taylor's ferry to southwest marigold partnership project mr chesak
 Good afternoon. I'm Kyle Chizik with the Bureau of Transportation. Ivy Dunlap is here with me from Bureau of Environmental Services. We have a unique project that we are taking out to bid. It is using our street-by-street standard or our out-of-the-mud standard to pave dirt and gravel street.
 We're doing a limited test project before we look at some larger projects in Brentwood-Darlington and the Cooley neighborhood as well to be able to test our design assumptions and test our –
 cost assumptions as well. This standard was meant to be more affordable. I have a really quick presentation, and Ivy just gave the clerk some pictures of the existing conditions on the street. So this is an area map of Southwest 19th. All the approaches to Southwest 19th are dirt and gravel. I have...
 orange arrows pointing at it there. Additionally, Southwest 19th at Taylor's Ferry and at Marigold has an existing street closure. So the street's blocked off there. And this creates kind of a little box there.
 where we can do this test for two and a half blocks for the street and in a regional stormwater facility and be able to test it in sort of a vacuum. So we're not worried about increasing traffic on a street. If it were connected to Taylor's Ferry, you know, people see the paved street, hey, that might be a great way to go. But with those existing street closures, we can really take advantage of that.
 So we're trying to meet both stormwater needs and our transportation needs. A lot of times I'm sure you all in council offices hear about, you know, we want our street paved. Well, PBOT comes back and we have stormwater issues or VES is trying to deal with the stormwater problem. And, well, you know, the street's not paved. So we have this back and forth. It's really a chicken or egg question.
 Of course, at BES, we usually say it's a PBOT problem. Yes. Yes. It's all in the eye of the beholder. But now we're working together on this, and we hope it's the continuation of a beautiful partnership. We want to reduce the sedimentation and turbidity in Tryon Creek. So if you looked at the previous slide, there is an existing regional stormwater facility. This will be another one to help protect the watershed health.
 We want to improve the street for safe routes to school. There's a school at the top of the hill that they existing use it as a safe route to school. It's also on our Southwest Trails Network.
 And we want to make it a proof of concept. If we're looking at doing more projects like this in Brentwood-Darlington and in Cully, then we want to make sure we get it right. And so that's why we started with the test. And finally, it's the implementation of a tiny little piece of the Tryon-Stevens-Headwaters neighborhood street plan that PBOT and BES did together.
 Basically, what we're going to do is we're going to retain that existing closure up at Marigold. We're going to add a regional stormwater facility with a pathway adjacent to it to access the bus stop down at the bottom of the hill. We will be putting at the base of the stormwater facility a little bit of sidewalk to improve that bus stop for people waiting. And we're going to pave the street to our street-by-street standard, which essentially is –
 We're paving the street, and we have gravel shoulders for parking, or in some cases we're narrowing those gravel shoulders to about a foot or two to save some mature trees that are out there. And the big thing that this does is it –
 Solves the question that was left open in our out of the mud report Which was how do we deal with the stormwater and in our report when we adopted the street-by-street standard? We said it would be contextual on a case-by-case basis. And so now we're finally implementing this Here's some pictures taken from the ones that were passed out to you and the council clerk I
 of the existing conditions. You can see the street closure. It's pretty bad out there. When it rains, you basically have tiny little rivers coming down and washing the sediment across Taylor's Ferry into Tryon Creek.
 So we have 100% plans completed. That's why we're coming here to ask for authorization to bid. We're bidding this fall. We don't want to build it in the rainy season, so we will build it early next spring. Tentatively right now we're thinking March. It will depend on the procurement process.
 And then finally, we want to have an evaluation after the project is done to make sure it's performing the way we intend it to. If there are issues, we can fix those. But also, it will help inform our street projects moving forward. Our estimate is between 500,000 and 600,000 people.
 When we get federal grants, our Federal Highway Administration likes us to put a range in. They don't want people to know exactly what our engineer's estimate is. So that's why you see that range there, but we actually do have an engineer's estimate that's pretty exact. And the costs are split roughly 50-50 between transportation and VES. We're using some of the funding that the mayor set aside for out-of-the-mud, the dirt and gravel streets, in last year's budget.
 And I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. It's like literally out of the mud to me questions. I just want to make a comment, which we're taking out of the mud and percent for green money. We're taking a smaller project and test driving some assumptions. And I think Steve and I have indicated we want to take that Errol Heights and Cully project down the road. So this is a chance to kind of work out some of the kinks. And, Kyle, you said something earlier that is very important, which is,
 We have in the past gotten bogged down over some jurisdictional issues and some code challenges. And I want to say that this partnership between BES and PBOT trying to get through that and figure out how to do this work differently I think is very important. These are small projects, but if what we learn from these projects are going to help us do our work better. And so I think I know Steve is very proud of this. I'm very proud of it at my bureau and hopeful that this will bear some fruit.
 Okay, any further questions? All right, let's see if we have some public testimony on this item. I think we do. Don, you get an award for – Yeah, endurance award. You stay here for more than four hours waiting to testify, you get a coupon. To testify again. For a 50% reduction on the parking ticket you got by waiting here for four hours. Fortunately, I rode the bus. Before I start, I just want to give you a brief update on what's happening with Southwest Trails, their trails policy.
 You guys passed the policy in October. To date, not one permit has been issued, and I don't even know that we've got, you know, the steps and everything in place. It's been an abysmal implementation. Second, two years ago, you approved $10,000 for a crossing from Stevens Creek, the public housing thing in Southwest.
 Not one thing has happened on that either. You know, this is not a city that works. I suggest you take the city that works labels off the transportation cars because it's not working. And this is really – citizens would like to have some things done over time, but waiting two years for something that was authorized by you, it's not a funding issue, it's simply an implementation issue, is totally unacceptable. No, Southwest 19th. First of all, I'm Don Bach. I live in Hillsdale. I'm sorry. Okay.
 I've commented in the past several years ago that Southwest 19th was the worst street I've ever walked in Southwest Portland. The Moguls, it's almost like a ski course. It was. It's not as bad now because we closed the street in many places. But at the time, we had traffic coming off of Southwest Taylor's Ferry, and it was terrible. This will be a huge improvement in this. And we really support it. I really...
 commend the Bureau of Transportation and the Bureau of Environmental Services for jointly working on this. It's going to, I think, be a really great step in the right direction. We're going to get a trail that works well. A couple things. One, I'd really like to ask that when you do the evaluation that the citizens be asked to participate in that as well because this is an important pedestrian environment that we want to preserve and enhance as we go forward across the city.
 And the second thing, this is not just an urban trail. This is a regional pedestrian trail. Once we have the bridge built at Boone's Ferry, which you guys approved not long ago, we have a little short segment of trail to build in St. Louis.
 Tryon Creek State Park will have a 12-mile trail from downtown Portland through Hillsdale all the way to Lake Oswego, and it'll be very walkable. It'll be a really great asset to the community. This is a very key component of that. The only one thing that is not included in this plan, and it's not a big deal because it'll be done later, is the crosswalk of Taylor's Ferry.
 You've got a bus stop there. You're asking people to cross the street to get to the bus, but we're not providing a crosswalk, and I think we need to think about those kind of things as we're doing these investments.
 As much as getting out of the mud, we need to make sure we're doing things safely. And Vision Zero, I like and support it greatly, but I think we really need to be aware that there's things we can do as we're building these projects to make it safer for people. It's a low investment. It's a little bit of an engineering challenge because of the site distance, which means we need to calm traffic a bit on Taylor's Ferry to make it happen. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks very much, Don. Anyone else? All right. This is an emergency ordinance. Let's take a vote, please. Yes.
 Saltzman? Novick? It's really great to see the teams at PBOT and BES working together creatively to solve problems and gather data to better solve future problems. Aye.
 Two members of the Markham neighborhood had attended this morning but were not able to stay. I think they have some concerns, and I know that the Bureau will work with them. I asked, do you want it held over, and the answer was, no, no, no, we need this contract to move forward. So obviously you'll be listening to them, Commissioner, and I appreciate that. Thank you.
 yes hi yay hi okay uh we have one more item left over from the morning calendar which i set over to this afternoon and that's 9 37. i think they're expecting to come up after the 2 p.m what's that they're expecting to come back later are they here they are ready they're here okay let's do 9 37 then
 Accept the Governor's Letter of Designation of the Lent Stabilization and Job Creation Collaborative as an Oregon Solutions Project. So there were some folks who were waiting through our morning proceedings. They're on their way into the room. We'll give them a moment. I'm sure they're here in the building still. Okay. And we appreciate their good work. Rachel will corral them and escort them here. Maybe, maybe not. Okay.
 Oh, all right. They're running down the stairs as we speak. Okay. With a dramatic entrance, Representative Rudin, come on up, please. We're waiting for you. Thank you for waiting. I think you waited quite a while, but we appreciate you being here. Welcome. Thank you. Thank you for having us.
 We know you've been having quite an interesting day. Yes, indeed. You know how those go. I do. I've heard that. Wow, it's really exciting to be here. So I'm just going to read through this so it will happen more quickly and keep me on track. So I'm State Representative Jeff Reardon.
 and we'll both be speaking today but thank you for having us here today. I want to begin by briefly recapping some of the other work that's been done or is in process in the proximity of the Lentz Stabilization and Job Creation Project. I think it's important to remember that these projects, when viewed together, reflect the city's commitment to improving the livability, the economic viability, and the environmental health of the Lentz and Palo Verde-Hirsch-Gilbert neighborhoods.
 Zenger Farms has been elevated to a thriving education hub and community center. Leach Botanical Gardens has plans to serve more people and a more diverse crowd. The streets are safer and there are more sidewalks. Lentztown Center has a group up and a half dozen new buildings will bring new retail and housing to the area. And of course, the Foster Floodplain Restoration Project has reduced the flooding along Foster Road. There's a lot more to be done, of course, but it's important to celebrate our accomplishments and your hard work.
 And I think this all helps put the Lent Stabilization and Job Creation Project in context. You see, this project will build on the other efforts to do three things. Keep people in their affordable homes, bring more and better jobs to the area so there will be more customers for the new businesses in the town center, and improve the health and functionality of the wetlands. With that introduction, I am before you today to tell you about an exciting project in my district in East Portland.
 For the past 15 months, I have been working with community and agency partners to develop the Lent Stabilization and Job Creation Project.
 Partnering with Mayor Charlie Hales, the City of Portland's Housing Bureau, Bureau of Environmental Services, Portland Development Commission, Planning and Sustainability, Oregon Solutions, and Governor Brown's Regional Solution Center, community advocates, and a host of others, we are launching a project to promote housing stability, jobs, economic growth, and natural resource enhancement within the Lentz 100-year floodplain on the east side of I-205.
 This is one of the most diverse and vulnerable areas of our city, and we have a unique opportunity to make changes that improve the lives and community stability. The economic health and public safety of the Lentz and Palahers Gilbert neighborhoods depends on this project. Within Lentz and Palahers Gilbert, approximately 330 acres are in FEMA's flood hazard areas. The rising cost of flood insurance is displacing vulnerable households,
 Retrofitting homes to mitigate flood damage can cost $30,000 or more. The diverse and low-income members of these neighborhoods simply cannot afford such repairs to their properties or rising insurance premiums. This project will help to protect vulnerable homeowners and will have economic benefits. The Lent Stabilization Job Creation Project has the ability to add new jobs, increase employment property value, and ultimately finance.
 Move as many as 400 single-family homes and 60 acres of land out of the 100-year floodplain and add 30 acres of additional natural areas. So, Michelle? Okay.
 Good afternoon. My name is Michelle Rudd. I'm privileged to be a member of the Portland Planning Sustainability Commission. I'm new to this project but very excited about it and thank the Council for supporting it. From my perspective, part of what's exciting about this is having been on the Commission for a while and worked on the Portland Plan, this feels like the rubber hits the road type of moment where we're actually acting on our glossy, pretty plan.
 We said in that plan that we were focused on equity. And as was mentioned, this is a diverse part of the city that's in some ways underserved.
 We also said in the Portland plan that we were putting a priority on healthy, connected communities, on economic prosperity and affordability, and thriving educated youth. And this just feels like a win-win-win situation. We had this objective of getting people out of their silos, getting the different bureaus working together, and also bringing in partners, realizing that the city couldn't do what it needs to do alone, that we needed to work with other partners.
 And that's what we're seeing here. We've been meeting this afternoon, and it's just been exciting to see the commitment from different forces here.
 In terms of hitting those different prongs we brought out in the Portland plan, we've talked about throughout the process the importance of economic prosperity, about industrial lands, their ability to provide middle-wage jobs that you don't necessarily need a college degree for. And we know that that type of job brings stability to neighborhoods. It has all sorts of ancillary benefits, and it brings stability to families that are key, I think, to the thriving educated youth.
 We did the Portland plan back in 2012 and focused on affordability, and we've all seen how much more of an issue that's become in just this short period of time. And the idea here that we can help people stay in their homes, that we can get ahead of some of these problems and help people stay in their existing homes, again, furthers that thriving educated youth idea.
 And helping them not get displaced, know that, yeah, the home's going to be the same place, the kid next to me in the classroom is going to be the same kid, and just providing that.
 I think it's also important in terms of the environmental benefits. To the extent these jobs that we're able to create on industrial lands can help serve the neighborhoods, we get people out of cars. We're also enhancing habitat and serving those goals as well. In the comprehensive plan, part of what we were dealing with was trying to balance these competing interests. And one of the strategies we talked about was
 understanding that industrial land is limited, was trying to find ways to intensify the use of the land we already had. And this is an opportunity to do that, to take industrial land that's so designated and so used, but get more jobs happening on it. So that sort of summarizes...
 from sort of a policy perspective, my interest in it. And as I've described to other people, as I've been sort of explaining what I'm looking forward to getting involved in, I started taking it to my own perspective and knowing that I grew up in a neighborhood where I could walk
 to school, to the pediatrician, to the corner grocer, that I was in school with the same kids, for better or for worse, you know, first through 12th grade, that my parents took me home from the hospital to the house my mom is still in, that my dad had the same job at the same place my entire childhood. When he passed away, my mom was left alone.
 financially secure and sort of recognizing we're in an environment, I think, where we're having a lot of discussions about privilege and sort of understanding the privileges all that have provided to me in my life and how that carries on generationally. That's not just my immediate family. It's my kids. It'll be their kids carrying on. And so that's what's exciting to me about the project. And again, why I thank you for supporting it.
 Mayor, thank you. Mayor, Commissioners, Nick Christensen, Lentz resident. I appreciate you taking this topic up after years of hard work on the part of your staff to get us to this point. I appreciate Representative Reardon for bringing us forward today.
 Several years ago, I looked to purchase my first home. I had just moved here from Las Vegas, and the idea of a 100-year floodplain kind of didn't even meet in my mind with reality. I didn't quite understand that. But a couple days before closing, we were told, this house is in a floodplain, and it'll be about $100 a month extra for insurance. And I said, well, we're this close, and whatever. Okay.
 Went forward with it. And then Hurricane Sandy hit the East Coast, and Congress decided they wanted to have the FEMA flood insurance program self-fund. And they were going to make it happen quickly. My flood insurance went from $1,300 a year to about $2,500 a year. We expect it to settle out at about $4,000 a year.
 $10 a day to pay for flood insurance in an area that, as far as we know, has never flooded, including in 96. That doesn't mean it won't. We expect that someday it probably will. Nonetheless, it's a cost and it's a burden, and I'm fortunate that I'm able to eat that cost every year. I know many of my neighbors have to make hard choices when they get a bill every January from FEMA saying it's going to cost this much this year, and you can expect it to go up more.
 This wasn't a situation we asked for. This isn't a situation where we came into a neighborhood knowing the problems we were going to face with. This landed on us, and it is disrupting the stability of the neighborhood. And fortunately, the Oregon Solutions Project has a light at the end of this tunnel. Your action today hopefully will set us on the course of finding a solution.
 I ask also that you think about this as you move forward with other decisions coming forward, coming down the pike. We are, as many of you know, facing a crisis of confidence in Lentz and the leadership of this council. I'm trying very hard as an optimist in government to say we can work together and find solutions for this and other problems this city is facing, but...
 It's hard to talk about trying to move forward with this project when we have people very angry about other things. So please help us move this forward towards success by working towards solutions that meet with the needs of my community for other projects as well. Thank you. Thank you, Nick. Sorry about your questions for any of these leaders. I just want to say while Jeff is here, it seems like on a regular basis Representative Reardon comes before us on something he's doing that we collaborate on.
 And whether it's the urban range or whether it's a park or whether it's a floodplain mitigation or whether it's whatever. And I've been on this council for eight years, and it has not always been that we've had such a partner. And I just want to, again, thank you for being such a great partner. Thank you for your comments. It's a pleasure to work with you and all of you. Thank you all.
 Appreciate you being here today. Thanks. Do you have other members of the team or others that want to speak on this item this afternoon? members of the team here, but Okay, I'll testimony, please. I show Charles Johnson Shedrick Wilkins and Veronica Good afternoon commissioners for the record. My name is Charles Johnson and as you know, I'm frequently here and it's a I
 good to actually see results for places we often talk about helping, but not that much comes across your desks for places that are under the East Portland Action Plan or Lentz. You know, I think that many people in our community are frustrated that, like the earlier 19th Street thing, sometimes it's very hard to get government to move, whether it's Salem or here. So I wanted to...
 Thank you for the whatever behind-the-scenes work had to be done with Representative Reardon and Governor Kate Brown's office to get these homeowners, who are not the most affluent and politically influential people in Portland, some release and assistance. The gentleman who just testified, of course, alluded to some people almost wish there might be flooding along the Springwater Corridor. I hope that as you also look at other ways government can work that people,
 we can target government action towards the problems like this flood insurance issue and dealing with people using the criminal system the way it's supposed to be used to deal with people who have a problem where they become criminals who deal with methamphetamine or bicycles, not uniformly acting against some homeless people who are close to having stable micro-community housing in Lentz. I think that even though people come to your lawn with ideas that are related to Lentz,
 They would like to be seen as people who are compassionate and only interested in reducing criminality, not discriminating against broad categories of people. Thank you. Thank you. Wilkins? I'm Shedrick Wilkins, and I think Southeast Portland is kind of a basket case, and I'll refer to why later on.
 I think what happened was is after World War II, a lot of housing and construction was done in southeast Portland, and there's no more places to build anything. And so a lot of the people there have construction type of skills, carpenters, stuff like that, that can't be employed. And my feeling is that the only way to solve this problem is to have, again, free community colleges,
 And I'm finding out that I got a letter from Senator Wyden, and that's really something that President Obama is pushing. And then we need to have control of the Congress to get that. But people need to be trained for medical jobs or other jobs or reconstructing houses or deconstructing houses instead of building houses. And this is one of the reasons why there's a big depressed area there. Now, why it's a depressed area is because I used to be a friend of Vern Cook.
 who used to be in the legislature for 28 years. He had three sons, and none of them were interested in politics. He is Mr. No Sales Tax. He's one of the reasons why we don't have a sales tax. He embraced me one time after the 1992 Bill Clinton election as a Democrat. And we used to talk politics. And he said basically Southeast Portland is a basket case. It needs something. And also I am a supporter of Kate Brown and her offices over here,
 It's called Mama's Restaurant. Kate Brown's campaign office isn't too far from here, and it's becoming well-staffed, and I will help her. It's not a re-election. I'm going to help her get elected governor. And, again, I want a woman president because Hillary Clinton will, again, extend Obama's programs for education. Thank you. Ms. Ng, welcome. Thank you.
 Hello, City Council. My name is Mary Ng. My mother made this sudden house decision regarding Lent, and we were frustrated with her because I wanted to go to law school at Lewis and Clark, so I was very happy with that arrangement to be crammed into Hillsdale. I loved the Hasidic Jewish community there, and...
 the lens issue was very difficult for us because we, um, had a resident meth house across the street from us. Um, just even last night, I was sexually harassed by a couple of gentlemen who fortunately didn't assault me. They offered to, and I, um, had, had the unfortunate circumstances of finding a young transient man who turned out to be nonviolent sleeping on my mother's porch. And, um,
 I want to thank the Portland police for their rapid and also very polite response in that matter. My next-door neighbors I reported to Coates for their substantial excessive structures and strange smells, which I don't know if it's a meth operation as well or what exactly is going on there. And what the firehouse said is that,
 Lentz particularly is a land of no code enforcement in terms of massive illegal structures because of the sort of quasi, you know, like mini house type stuff, people living in sheds. And
 I notice a lot of beautification issues that could be improved in terms of just sidewalk cleanup, garbage. I know there are people of my generation who are desperate to have a job or some kind of benefits of some kind. So I think some beautification and more community spirit building issues.
 will help. And all the concerns of the homeowners really don't affect me because I am so deeply impoverished by this economy or my own lifestyle choices. But I want to thank you for enduring this incredibly tremendously long day. And I was going to try to keep it...
 short and say, I love Lentz, which is this motto that Lentz has kind of branded itself with. And I have to say, I kind of love Lentz. It's finally grown on me. But even though I'm sort of just kind of patching it up with mom and realizing how much I love her. And I love you too, Charlie
 It will take time for people to realize what you've done for this community, and I don't think you realize that and how much I love the police for all those incredibly interesting interactions with Benjamin Pickering. I met some fabulous officers. I met...
 Dinah Brooks. I'm offered to volunteer for the Behavioral Health Unit, and I'm so thrilled that we made it out alive. And I hope O'Day has a successful recovery. And I'm sorry you were in that position. My mom said she'd do the same thing you did. She's a Capricorn, just like you.
 thank you all right thank you both just take uh continue to focus on linson the uh home ownership rental balance and the code enforcement needs of those people there thank you thank you all okay anyone else then let's take a vote please on this resolution i appreciate all the good work of the oregon solutions team and representative reardon and michelle rudd and others thank you hi novick uh process is a you know
 intense one and I wish everybody luck at both getting through the process and using it successfully. As a reminder, we dedicated $460,000 as a special appropriation in this couple of years budget to demonstrate our support for the project. Thank you very much for all of your work. Hi. I've had the great privilege of working on two Oregon Solutions projects, one around Gateway Green with Linda and others.
 and a second one called Thousand Gardens, where we tried to figure out how to turbocharge our community garden program. And particularly at a time when the relationship between the people we serve and electeds is strained, I think it's especially important to have a process like this where third parties come in and help bring people together. And in my experience, they produced some really great results that our normal process would not get us to.
 And I deeply appreciate the people who have signed up to lead this effort, Michelle and Jeff. And I also just want to say Jeff Reardon is always on the right side of things, coming and working with this council, and we're appreciative. Aye. Nails.
 Well, the name of this project is a collaborative, and that's the right word. And that's what the Oregon Solutions process is designed to do. So I appreciate the governor and her staff and her team for supporting this process. It's a method of having multiple government agencies and the community work on a complex problem that otherwise everybody would either –
 point fingers or throw up their hands about. And this way we grapple the problem together in a collaborative way. And I have a lot of confidence both in that structure and in the people involved, neighborhood leaders in Lentz and the folks that have stepped up to lead this process. So thank you all. It is good work. This is the right way to do it. And as I think Nick's testimony really illustrated, it's really going to make a very tangible difference in people's lives today.
 when we move this towards a solution. So thank you all for doing just that. Aye. Thank you, and thanks for your patience in waiting for that. Okay, we are to our single afternoon item, which is a time-certain, sort of certain, 943.
 943, accept the Gateway Urban Renewal Area Five-Year Action Plan. I'll talk about another part of the city where we've been collaborating and trying to move things forward for a while. That would be Gateway. So welcome, and thanks for waiting to get this presentation underway this afternoon.
 Thank you, Mayor Hales, Commissioners. My name is Justin Douglas, Policy Manager with the Portland Development Commission. We noticed online today that the agenda said that this would be a 90-minute item. We fully expect to be done within 180 minutes. So...
 No, we'll be brief. We think we can do this in probably a half an hour. We do have some folks here to testify. I just wanted to mention two things before turning it over to Leila Aman, who's been the project manager on the Gateway Action Plan. One is just to talk, kind of take a trip down memory lane or to talk about a brief history of Gateway, and then also to talk about why we're working on an action plan.
 So in the post-war era, Gateway was where there were orchards, there were farms, and the transition from that to be what it is today has been dramatic. That said, there is still a long way to go.
 When Metro adopted the 2035 growth concept in 1995, it anticipated that there would be 50,000 jobs in Gateway. The Opportunity Gateway process in 1998 envisioned a dense mixed-use neighborhood with parks and amenities. The Gateway Plan District, which sets the zoning, allows for buildings in some areas of up to 15 stories,
 And yet I often get asked questions about, well, what's happening with Gateway? Why don't we see more there? And the legacy that Gateway was not part of the city of Portland until the 1980s, and the transition from a predominantly rural and then suburban neighborhood to one that's expected to be a dense urban environment is going to take some time.
 So we believe that the Gateway Action Plan that we're presenting to you today will help get – will accelerate that transition to what policymakers and PDC and community stakeholders have always believed in Gateway, that it can be a place that East Portland is proud of. And I think it's also important to acknowledge that while I think some people feel like there hasn't been enough to happen in Gateway, there have been some really significant accomplishments, and it's been through partnerships.
 So working with TriMet, we were able to keep the Oregon Clinic and their 200 employees from leaving Portland to go out of state, and they stayed in Gateway with a 100,000-square-foot Class A medical office building at the Gateway Transit Center, a LEED gold building.
 Working with the Bureau of Transportation, we were able to complete the 102nd Avenue streetscape project to widen sidewalks, to install street lamps, to install trees. The Northeast 97th Avenue local improvement district project paved streets in Central Gateway and also provided confidence to a local developer who built 80 units of much-needed workforce housing. The acquisition of the four-acre park site at 106th and Halsey will be the first park
 in Gateway, and I'm very proud of that. And that was through a partnership with the Parks Bureau, and community stakeholders have been crucial throughout all of this work. So I think we have had many accomplishments in Gateway, and we believe that the action plan will help set the stage moving forward. Thank you.
 So the question of why are we doing an action plan, well, this is now the third action plan that Mayor Hales has provided leadership to PDC to complete, both of which have come to city council to accept. The first was the Old Town Chinatown Action Plan in 2013.
 And then the Lentz Action Plan in 2014. And both of them, as are the Gateway Action Plan, were effective in galvanizing support for shared priorities over the next five years and help identify budget actions and staffing that inform the work that we do. There have been many things that have happened in Old Town Chinatown, but we've seen the redevelopment of the Pacific Northwest College of Art. We've seen new workforce housing. We've seen seismic rehabilitations.
 In Lentz, we've seen the Portland Mercado, and we've seen the transformation, well, we will be seeing the transformation of four significant projects in the Lentz town center
 So on Gateway, we believe that the action plan will make investments that we believe will have the greatest impact over the next five years that are in alignment with PDC's strategic plan to create healthy, complete neighborhoods. And then it also prioritizes working with bureau partners that will address regulatory challenges that we believe that when they're addressed, it will allow for new growth in the district long after there is a PDC urban renewal area in Gateway. Okay.
 So with that, I'll turn it over to Layla. Thank you, Justin. Mayor Hales and commissioners, my name is Layla Aman, and I am a senior project coordinator at the Portland Development Commission. As Justin mentioned, I had the good fortune of being the project manager for the Gateway Action Plan. And kind of building off of your last agenda item, Justin,
 This was developed in the spirit of collaboration. And I just want to take a brief moment here to acknowledge the many partners that participated deeply with us in the creation of this plan. We have our bureau partners, so Javier Menya, Assistant Director of Housing from the Portland Housing Bureau,
 Kirk Krieger and Dan Layden from the Portland Bureau of Transportation, Tyler Bump and Joe Zender from the Bureau of Planning and Sustainability, and Jillian Detweiler, you may know her. I think she works for Mayor Hales. And, of course, our new Executive Director, Kimberly Branham. That is our public sector team. We also had, and he is here today to provide testimony, Nadal Khan, who is CALL, who is...
 one of our members of the Halsey-Weidler Group and also a member of the Gateway Area Business Association. And along with him, I just want to acknowledge Aniko Bedia, Tom Badrick, and Linda Robinson, who will be providing some testimony, and many of whom you may know and have been involved in Gateway for a very long time.
 So again, I say this plan really was developed in the spirit of collaboration. It resulted in a framework that will enable us to work in concert with our public, community, and private sector partners. And I think this working together aspect of the plan is essential to its success. The plan embodies PDC's strategic plan goals for prosperity for all Portlanders.
 The actions in this plan are designed to help support complete and healthy neighborhoods, to foster equitable wealth creation, and to increase access to employment through an inclusive process. These are shared goals of our city and all of our partners, and we believe honor the aspirations for the communities in which we are working. The plan delivers on these goals by focusing resources in strategic areas and gateway areas.
 that align public resources and actions with the places that have the best potential for achieving community aspirations. The focus areas include actions that are tailored to each area's development readiness. The plan thoughtfully aligns public resources and identifies regulatory strategies to help overcome barriers to development and to enhance Gateway's potential to become a true regional center. The focus of the plan is on the Halsey-Weiler Corridor.
 um it is the heart of community developed plans it has the greatest potential for small business development and significantly owned public assets it is truly the main street of the district simply put the halsey-weidler district possesses the best bones of any commercial area in gateway and has the potential to lift the entire district the gateway transit center is characterized as the area within about a quarter mile of the transit station
 And Central Gateway is primarily land that is focused on employment. And I'll talk a little bit more about each of those areas in detail. The Halsey-Weidler Business District, which is really our focus, is home to a collection of unique small businesses. And strengthening this district means supporting small businesses, supporting long-time property and business owners, and
 and creating more opportunities for wealth creation and prosperity by lowering barriers to entry for new businesses and providing additional support to long-time businesses and property owners. You may be familiar with our Halsey-Weidler Commercial Investment District Strategy, and this plan builds off of those efforts, many of which are ongoing at this time.
 We project the Gateway District will generate about $35 million in TIF revenue for the Portland Development Commission. Of that, we have earmarked about $20 million of that for the Halsey-Weidler District. The focus of efforts will be business support and development. That's the major focus here. Enhancing existing businesses and bringing new businesses to this authentic and unique area. It embodies the commercial investment strategy.
 We'll also be focusing on redevelopment to provide much-needed community amenities, as the park, as Justin mentioned, create a critical mass of people to support businesses and focus housing for a diverse range of incomes.
 And finally, the plan acknowledges and embraces Gateway's auto-centric form, but it provides direction on moving the area towards a more multimodal and safer environment, which will have positive impacts on the businesses and make it safer for residents, commuters, and customers to move around and in Gateway.
 I believe you will be seeing the Halsey-Weidler Intergovernmental Agreement coming to you sometime next month. And that is a major commitment on the part of the city and something that we think will have a tremendous impact on the district. The Gateway Transit Center has some of the greatest potential for having higher intensity land uses and becoming the urban center we hope it can be. Actions here are tailored to the area's development readiness.
 There's some prep work that still needs to be done here in terms of the regulatory framework and creating the urban form that enhances the connectivity of this area. There are large underutilized parcels, but there is limited connectivity. Finding creative solutions for implementing the Master Street Plan is important to unlocking private investment in the area. Actions here are intended to build a foundation from which we can grow incrementally while preserving the opportunity to achieve higher aspirations in the future.
 In Central Gateway, this area has significant potential for economic development. And even more so than the transit center, there are some serious infrastructure needs here. The map that we're showing here I think highlights some of those major issues. The black lines there are the local and arterial street network, and you can see there are some major gaps there.
 And so we want to work with property owners in this area to find ways, again, to be creative about how we can implement the Gateway Master Street plan and to get that area primed for redevelopment. Another aspect of this plan is the community engagement that we did for this project. We held an open house at the Immigrant and Refugee Community Organization.
 We had over 70 attendees, which was a great outpouring of support. We took a lot of feedback from those meetings. We had the invitation translated into three languages. We had interpreters on hand. So we really made a big push to get out to the diverse community that is in Gateway. We also held an online survey. We had this up for about two or three weeks.
 and allowed participants who were unable to attend the open house to provide feedback on the priorities and just to provide comments as well. And so we also held specific meetings. You can see the list here, but we met with the East Portland Police Bureau, East Portland Action Plan, the neighborhood organizations, and the business organizations out in Gateway. And we took that feedback and we changed the plan. The key themes that we really heard is that there is support for the Halsey-Weidler Business District.
 and we heard loud and clear that there's support for affordable housing, but there was support for mixed income that includes affordable housing. And finally, providing flexibility in resources was an important comment that we received as well. We originally had $25 million allocated to the Halsey-Weidler District, and so we changed that to create an opportunity fund to be responsive to public feedback and also to be responsive to opportunities that may arise that we did not anticipate.
 To give you an overview of how we propose to allocate these resources, in addition to the $5 million, we're looking at about $20 million in Halsey-Weidler, $8 million for the Gateway Transit Center, and $2 million for Central Gateway. There are other tools that we can use in Central Gateway. I just want to highlight we have the E-Zone program, which is intended to help support job growth as well. Okay.
 To give you an overall sense of what all the partners are bringing to the table, PDC has about $35 million. The Portland Housing Bureau has about $13 million in TIF resources.
 And the Portland Bureau of Transportation has so far committed about $5 million. There are some projects that may get funded that would be added to this, as well as potential transportation system development charges. So for a total of about $53 million over the next five years. Can you go back to that slide for a sec? Sure. You earlier said that some of the feedback you got from the community is they wanted mixed-income housing.
 In light of the restrictions that attach to urban renewal dollars in terms of investing in housing, how did you reconcile that? Are you proposing to go above the 30 percent to put other dollars into housing so you can achieve income guidelines that are outside of the 30 percent framework? Yes.
 Good question, Commissioner Fish. I can tell you right now the project that's being proposed at the 106th and Halls East site, the Human Solutions and Girding Edelman team, we've heard loud and clear from community members that they would like to see a mix of affordable housing and obviously the Portland Housing Bureau would play a role in supporting that up to the 60 percent MFI level.
 PDC recently has worked with our development partners in the Lentz Town Center to explore opportunities for workforce housing between 60% and 100% MFI. And so we have shared with the development team that if they are able to craft a project with a program that had mixed income housing, that we would consider supporting a project like that. And so that would be taking money out of the 70% pot for that purpose? That's correct. Right. Well, it would actually be – it's not 70 now. It would be –
 60. Sorry, 65. We're in the middle. Thereabouts. Okay. Other questions for our team here? Great. Thank you both. I know we have some of the leadership you mentioned that are queued up here to speak. Want to give them a chance to come up and do that? No more. Here for anyone else? Come on up, please. Any of you that worked on this plan that would like to tell us about it? Yeah, you're a shy bunch. I know that about you.
 Here comes a really shy person. I think we should make her talk first, too. All right, Tom, go ahead. Okay, thank you, Mayor. Thank you, Commissioners. My name is Tom Badrick, and I'm here representing more groups than I want to think about, but we'll just say Park Rose Heights. I'm on the board of the Business Association, part of the Halsey-Weidler Group, and the chair of the newly reforming eco-district for the Gateway area.
 And I'm not going to talk because I've been here long enough and I've seen how much you've already had to sit through. I'm not going to talk a long time. I'm just going to say that we're very excited about this project. I'm very supportive of it. There's a lot of good that can come out of it. There is a lot of money available.
 And I remember a couple years ago when we started the original streetscape discussion, and it was a couple hundred thousand dollars, and it was really hard to get too terribly excited about it. Now we're looking at a significant investment from the city, and we're grateful. Thank you. There's tremendous opportunity in Gateway, and we have been waiting a very long time for that moment where things turn the corner and we become what we've always been destined to be. So I just want to be supportive of this, talk about the
 the excitement in the community that's building. You can feel it every day. It's growing a little more, and then hand it off to these two to say something more valuable. My name is Nadal Call. I'm on the board of the Gateway Area Business Association, also the chair of the Halsey-Weidler Working Group, and a very proud member of the Gateway community. I own Furniture Plus, and the property that it occupies on 103rd and Halsey, which is right in the heart of the area we're discussing. I want to
 again, thank you for, uh, allowing us to come in and offer some testimony here today. I'd like to echo, uh, what Tom just said. Uh, there has been a, a lot of weight for some positive change, uh, in the gateway district, uh, and especially on the Halsey-Weidler corridor. Um, it is, in my opinion, uh,
 one of the last gems in Portland. And I foresee that that corridor is going to be one of the greatest corridors that the city is going to be the most proud of, uh, as, as we look, uh, in, uh, on Portland's history. Um, so right now there's obviously a lot happening. We've gained a lot of momentum and we want to see that momentum continue. Uh, the gateway action plan is, uh, a very positive, uh,
 plan for all of us involved in Gateway. I've had the privilege of watching all the moving parts come together, and now we're on the tail end for implementation. And that's the area I really want to focus more on. I think one of the primary successes in just the development of this plan is the level of engagement that PDC focused on with the community. They really got the community involved.
 they identified stakeholders, and dissemination of information increased greater, I think, on Halsey-Weiler than any other organization I've been involved in. So I've been very privileged to be a part of that, have been able to make new friends, and now I think it's really important that we see this plan all the way through and identify one of the primary successes, and that is
 the public outreach, community engagement of all stakeholders and anyone that has any interest in Gateway to at least have a forum where they're heard. So as plans are implemented...
 Naturally, there are potential challenges that are unforeseen. And so I just want to stress that any potential changes to the plan and processes of the implementation are communicated to the public and that they are included in that process. Thank you.
 Welcome. I'm Linda Robinson. I live in the Hazelwood neighborhood. I'm on the board there. I'm part of the Halsey-Whitehall group and a few other things. I also have been involved with the Gateway Urban Renewal.
 for 15 or 20 years. And I do want to acknowledge that PDC, in the last two or three years, really has made considerable progress in getting involved with the community and actually coming out and working with, specifically with people who live there and work there, more than they did in the first 15 years or so. So I'm really pleased with that. This plan is an example of that. They did make some significant changes to the plan based on the input that they got from us.
 particularly making that flexible fund to take advantage of opportunities because I know that some of these kinds of projects, they have lots of history, lots of background. It takes a long time before they become public. Who knows what's in the progress that, you know, that
 And suddenly if you made a decision that you're going to spend it all on this part and somebody's been working on something over here, then they're suddenly left in the lurch. So I appreciate that. I do want to say a couple of things. One has to do with 102nd Avenue improvements. They didn't finish that project yet.
 It only went south to Burnside. I understand why they didn't finish the sidewalks on the other part because a lot of that sidewalk work is being done as projects have come through. But we do need the pedestrian-level street lighting, the signage and things that go with it. So I'm hoping that some of this money can go toward that.
 I'm really excited about the idea of making some effort to better link the transit center to the business community. People get off the train and they have no idea that there's even a business district there. There's no easy way to get through there, through the gateway shopping center, you know, to anything else or signs. There's no signs in the gateway area that say how to get to the transit center. So we really need some drastic improvements on that level. And then finally I wanted to...
 to mention the project next to the park that they've been talking about. And with this money that's designated to be spent in the Halsey-Whitley area, I'm hoping that some of that money that isn't the affordable housing money can be spent to subsidize that so we can get that mix of housing that we desperately need in that area. We need affordable housing, but we also need the other housing as well in order to have a mix. Okay.
 Thank you, and I do support this plan, and those are the reasons. Linda, where are we in Gateway Green? Just a quick update. Gateway Green. Oh, wow. We're getting ready to do a crowdfunding campaign next month. We have a deadline to raise our match for the Metro grant, and it's coming up soon. And we're actually getting permission to start events there as soon as we can clear out the campers. Parks has said we can start planning events and activities there. Thank you.
 Welcome. Good afternoon. Hi. My name is Emiko Badio. I'm going to quickly read through my spiel because I'm a newbie at this. I've been a resident of Portland for 14 years and a small business owner here for 13. When my husband and I first opened our small grocery store in 2003, it was in an out-of-the-way area of Portland on Southeast Division and 43rd. Look at Southeast Division now.
 In 2007, we completely moved to another area of the industrial and non-retail friendly corner of Southeast Stark and 12th Avenue. Again, look at Southeast Stark now. So now in 2016, we are finally going to open our second location in another often overlooked area, the Gateway Business District in the Halsey-Wheedler Corridor.
 As we had our one and only location on Stark these past nine years, and as we've been in business for 13 and residents for 14, we've experienced the growth of Portland business-wise and personally wealth for over a decade. It has been overwhelming in many negative and some positive ways, but it's all happened so fast. You'd only really need to have lived here for the past year to see it for yourself.
 Renters are feeling the push and pressure from the growth, and as a small business who is always leased, we feel this as well. Every week we hear about another small, old-school Portland business who needs to move or close shop because of 100% to 300% rent increases or property owners selling the building they rent in. We know we've been lucky so far, yet we worry that it's only a matter of time for us on Southeast Dark and 12th.
 to try and ensure some stability for our life's work in our future we're taking a great opportunity to be part owners and tenants in a building in the halls halsey-weedler corridor of the gateway business district so we can feel reassured um in being owners and occupiers rather than tenants anticipating another possible push out from future extreme rent increases
 We're not strangers to starting our business in overlooked areas, but for us, coming into Gateway simultaneously as the action plan is being implemented is very comforting. I understand the urgent need for attention to this historically underserved area, and unlike other parts of inner Portland, I hope Gateway will always stay small business friendly, racially diverse, and inclusive to folks with low incomes as it grows.
 The Gateway Action Plan is a huge motivator for us, and we are super thankful to be able to have access to the PDC grants for Gateway businesses and all of the time, and Gateway community members who have welcomed us and showed us immense support so far.
 We're excited to become part of this passionate and dedicated community and gateway. And also, personally, my husband and I also recently moved from living this whole time in Portland in the inner southeast to Wilkes, the Wilkes neighborhood. So we're also personally there and dedicated to being part of that community as well as business-wise. So thanks. Great.
 excited to have them thank you all right others who would like to speak on this point come on up please welcome hi my name is Joe Westerman and I build apartments in the Portland area I've been in front of you before and testified the last time was the
 Gateway LID on 97th, and I praised that program because it worked, and it opened up that area for further development. And since then, and one of the things I said is I wanted to develop –
 market rate and affordable housing in that area just south of Gordon Jones's, the Rose Apartments. And since then I've had the early assistance program that the planning department offers. And they're going to require me to do a street dedication, which means it takes a third of the land and it makes further development in the area not feasible. Okay.
 Yeah, it would take 30% of my land to add the street. You build the street. And it just doesn't work financially. It more than triples my cost. And I think this is a good time to look at an LID for the whole area because...
 Gateway will thrive, but it needs affordable housing and other types of housing so that the jobs that get created in that area, people can live close by. They can walk to work and that kind of stuff. But in that particular area, which, I mean, there can be over 1,000 units there. And until the street systems get figured out and a way to finance them, it's kind of at a standstill in that.
 Gordon Jones' project is probably the only one that's going to be built until that solution is found. Male Speaker 1 Thanks for bringing that up, and hopefully PBOD and PDC and others can work with you and other property owners in the same kind of successful way that we did on that LID because, you know,
 PTC and private, yeah, that is a good – Yes, indeed. Yes, indeed. Thank you. And I'm a believer that we ought to be doing LIDs on a larger scale, places like this. I think Steve feels the same way. So if we can find enough agreement about that, that's an option. Yes, indeed. Thank you very much. Thank you. Well, I'm Cedric Wilkins, and I was born and raised north of Gateway. When my first experience was young, I was at –
 I heard stories about this. Fred Myers, the store there, had the first color television brought and sold in Oregon. And he made a big thing out of this in 1954. And the Gateway Arch was supposed to be facing towards the east in which the East Coast would make all these wonder things like color televisions and stuff like that. And I think Fred Myers had the first electronic cash registers and some other stuff that was done there.
 It's funny to me that in the last eight years, I worked for the Target store, which is south of there, slightly south, in which the digital age started in 2008, right, and flat screens. And I could pick up the same thing, but those things were made in the other direction in Japan. So it was kind of funny for me to – recently,
 I had 30 or 40 years of vacant time at seeing Fred Meyers. It's a real area, too, because I-205 runs south. And then when they built light rail, they built light rail right near the Fred Meyers store. And it's a very historic 1954. I mean, I wasn't born yet, but you could still feel the sense. I used to go in there and see transistor radios and all that.
 You know, or portable televisions. And just go. So, all right, all right. Thank you. Charles. Good afternoon again, commissioners. Charles Johnson for the record. Most of my economic activity happens on 102nd, where tragically we go from an area serviced by three MAX lines to just being serviced by the blue line. But I hope that...
 given the skepticism about some people about how they feel about whether the PDC really serves their communities that, while you're with us, Mayor Hales, unless you resign for the next five months, that you'll foment conversations between the big players here, I don't know whether Winco owns their property or rents. I think Fred Meyer is a property owner that doesn't rent. And the Oregon Clinic, right?
 When we talk about density, especially as much as Steve Novick likes to, part of Futures Portland is people that walk out of their sidewalk onto an immediate transit connection. That means there needs – some people would say leave it to the free market. Other people say good leadership in Portland means that the Oregon Clinic parking lot –
 needs to become a mixed-use unit that covers a diverse range of income people so that people can walk out their door onto three MAX lines and go to the airport to downtown or down to Happy Valley. I hope that we can foment that sort of thing in a way that doesn't make it an economic refugee destination only afforded by people fleeing San Francisco.
 The Halsey-Weidler corridor, I only get as far as Portland Adventist Community Services. They may not be a great fit for some people's vision of the neighborhood, but it's good to see you so much attention for east and southeast Portland in today's session, and I hope that the gentleman beside me can feel that your offices are responsive and don't,
 slough people off to the PDC, but do things that invigorate connections among residents, entrepreneurs, and established property holders in that neighborhood. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
 Thank you all very much. Further council questions or discussions? Mayor, may I call Kimberly Branham up? Well, we certainly should do that. And I'll defer to you first. Well, just nice to have the executive director designee here. She begins work in a couple weeks in her new capacity. Yes. And actually, it's fitting that you're here on this item, I think, Kimberly, because you're such a believer in this kind of collaborative work at the neighborhood scale. So she's led a lot of the work on the Neighborhood Prosperity Initiative for
 districts within our corpus of work at PDC. So I'm sure this is a pleasure for you to see the good work that you and others at PDC have done coming to fruition this way. But congratulations and welcome. Thank you so much. I think you probably have some other folks that would like to give you a pat on the back or two. Thank you. Yeah, thrilled to be here. We're excited to be here with the Gateway Action Plan and to hear all the support and ready to get going.
 So congratulations, Kimberly. And one of the things that stands out here in this plan is both increasing access to high-quality employment and also an equitable wealth creation strategy. One of the things that I'd like for us to continue the conversation about is what's our capacity to drive that agenda? Thank you.
 You know, I've had the chance to go to some meetings with Venture Portland and this district and others, and they're very good at convening, and they often play a role as an ombudsman. But with this focus on job creation and equity, and particularly recognizing we're a small business town, I think one of the things that I'll want to talk to you about over time and get your views is, do we have the right structure to do that?
 what is Venture Portland's role and how might that change or evolve? And then we have a mayor-elect who said that that small business piece he wants to really focus on. So what does that mean structurally?
 And I want to get a head start on that because I'm interested. But mostly I just wanted to call you up to say congratulations. Thank you. Yes, and I would love to talk to you more about that. We believe that we are well positioned in Gateway with the industrial area, and we have some early support for businesses. And so we think we, you know, with partnership are on our way, but would be happy to talk to you more about that. So thank you. Thank you very much. All right, then let's please take a vote on this resolution.
 Well, thank you for the good work that PDC and the neighbors are doing in Gateway, and hope springs eternal. Hi. Novick.
 I really appreciate all the work people in the community have done in this whole plan and on the incorporated Halsey-Weiler commercial corridor streetscape improvement plan. This is an opportunity to once again give a shout out to Shamia Fagan who sadly is retiring from the legislature but got the money for a succession of rapid flash beacons at sorely needed intersections including the installation of a RFB.
 at the 106th and Wydler crossing. And I'm glad to know that with a combination of PDC and PBOT funds, we are going to drastically improve pedestrian and bicyclist safety in the whole Halsey-Wydler couplet from 100th to 114th. Thanks, everybody, very much. And again, Kimberly, congratulations.
 Thank you very much for all of the good work. It's a short presentation here at the Council, but I know it's been a very long, hard grind at many times, and it is another step in the right direction for the great community of Gateway. I particularly appreciated both in the impact statement when it was filed today
 before council and in your presentation today, you told us how you changed the plan in response to community testimony. I expect no less from PDC or from the Gateway community as to have that active involvement and then both of you figuring out an even better path. So thank you very much. I. You know, when I started on this council, the question was how to light the spark to get Gateway going. And just making some notes about while I was listening to the testimony, I used to live near Gateway.
 And, you know, when I got sick, I went to the urgent care, which is incredibly convenient, whether by car or by mass transit. I recently was at the Russellville Senior Center, not just to reserve a place, but also to have a little town hall. There's a new park. Commissioner Fritz is working on a mixed-use development. There's a wealth of food options in the area. I've been to Furniture Plus for a community meeting.
 and we were graciously welcomed by the owner. Habitat for Humanity built some homes there. I think that even John Gray might have helped finance. Charlie had a hand on a community center. There's all these. Gateway Green is about to reach a new milestone. My suspicion is that sooner rather than later, all these pieces are going to start connecting, and then we're going to be talking about how to protect the uniqueness of Gateway Green. Excuse me, of Gateway, because there's a lot happening there, and you can feel it.
 I want to join with my colleagues on thanking the folks in the community that have been advocating for Gateway. This seems like a good plan. Mayor Hales actually was very clear in the early part of his term he wanted to see action in Gateway and Lentz. And since he's in charge of PDC, he gets to set those priorities and then drive it. And so I think this is encouraging. There's a lot of positive things going on in Gateway. And I think this focuses on some things which will make it even better. Thanks for your good work. Bye. Thank you.
 This is another case of doing the right thing the right way. We've got neighborhood leaders who really care about this place, who've put in lots of time over the long run to try to chart its future, and have worked really collaboratively together, and with the city and the PDC in particular in this case.
 I appreciated the reference to the sort of corpus of three neighborhood-scale action plans that we've worked on together. And that really is what makes these work. So we've got to have a real understanding, a practical understanding with the people that own property and have businesses and live in the neighborhood or otherwise.
 invested in it to get this stuff going. And I also hope and expect and will drive for the same kind of results that have happened in the other two action plans, which is do it this way.
 get it adopted, and then start moving dirt and get some cranes in the air. And we certainly accomplished that or are accomplishing that in both Lentz and Old Town Chinatown, and I fully expect that we're going to do that here as well. So great work and a good plan.
 Finally, I just want to note, and I think you could hear it just in their presentations here that Justin and Layla are not only doing good work as leaders of this effort at PEC in terms of crafting a good plan, really listening to community leadership and shaping it based on their direction, but you can tell they're also real cheerleaders and salespeople for this district. They believe in it.
 And I think that matters a lot in this work, that it's not just an exercise, it's not just a box to check, but you have to actually believe. And obviously these people do. And that, I think, bodes very well for that plan becoming real. Finally, I want to thank Jillian Detweiler, because if there's anybody whose focus is on making it happen and getting things going, it's her. And I just appreciate her good work on this and everything else that we've been accomplishing with PDC. So thank you all for a job well done. Look forward to coming to some groundbreakings. Aye.
 Thank you all, and we are, believe it or not, adjourned.
