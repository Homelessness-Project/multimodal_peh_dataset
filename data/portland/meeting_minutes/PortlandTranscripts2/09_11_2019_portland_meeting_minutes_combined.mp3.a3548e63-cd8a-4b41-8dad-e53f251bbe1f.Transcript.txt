All right, folks, good morning, everyone. Good morning, colleagues. Good morning, honored guests. Before we get into our council meeting this morning, we'd like to take a moment to remember and reflect on the 18th anniversary of September 11th, the tragedy that took the lives of so many people in our country. On this day, 18 years ago, thousands of people went to work as they would on any other day, not knowing the horrific tragedy that faced them. The attacks on 9-11 were horrific, but they didn't break the American spirit. In fact, it unified us. We witnessed this in heroic efforts of the men and women in uniform, our first responders, who fearlessly went towards the devastation, some of them sacrificing their lives in the process. We've invited representatives from both the firefighters, the union, and the police union to share remarks and lead us in a moment of silence as we reflect on the great heroism and the spirit of our first responders and honor all of the lives which were lost. I'd like to, before I turn this over to Alan Ferschweiler from the Portland Firefighters Association, I'd like to recognize that we have Fire Chief Sarah Boone here today. We have leadership from the Portland Police Bureau. I believe AC Davis is here and AC Lee are here and others. Portland Police Association, I believe Darryl Turner is planning to be here. We have a number of PPB lieutenants, many other firefighters and uniformed personnel and we thank you for being here to share this moment with us. And with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Fershweiler. Thank you for being here, Alan. And Chief Boone, AC Lee, and a cast of many other leaders. Thank you. Good morning. Commissioner Fritz, Commissioner Fish, Mayor Wheeler, thank you for having us here today. I'm Alan Frischwald, I'm president of the Firefighters Association. I'm here with our fire chief, Chief Boone, and her administrative staff, which you've seen behind me. Acting Mayor Chief Lee on my left and representing us together, and I'll be making the remarks today. Thank you. 18 years ago, we had a horrific situation in this country. Over 3,000, or around 3,000 people lost their lives, including 343 firefighters and 20 police officers that day. Since that time, and even since the last 9-11 memorial, we've lost 200, just 200 police officers to their 9-11 illnesses that they had. Recently, Congress finally authorized the Victim Compensation Fund, which will take care of the injuries for those that have succumbed to some of the illnesses. Unfortunately, since 9-11 has happened, we've had 500 total firefighters and police officers that have died from their illnesses. And today we wonder why we say we never forget. It's because every day we have a memory of somebody else that's a victim of it. And so today I want to thank you for having us here. We're going to do a moment of silence and in reflecting on the number of how we do the moment of silence, we're going to do 35 seconds. And that reflection is for the 30, the 3000 people that lost their lives. and the 500 that have lost their lives since then. A total of 3,500 people that have been affected, and we'll do a second for every 100 that's been affected. So, Mayor, if you wouldn't mind leading us during that moment. Very good. Please join me in recognizing a moment of silence for 35 seconds. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And for all those that are available, I know 9-11 is on Wednesday and you have council agenda. We are having a public ceremony at 11 a.m. as well over at Station 21 at 5 Southeast Ash at 11 a.m. for anybody that's available to come and for the public as well. Thank you, Alan. Thank you for your time. We appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all for being here. Thank you. Thanks, gentlemen. Appreciate it. All right, good morning, everyone. This is the morning session of the Portland City Council on September 11th, 2019. Good morning, Carla. Please call the roll. Good morning. Hardesty? Udaly? Fritz? Here. Fish? Here. Wheeler? Here.

Request of Cheryl Graves to address council regarding homeless children, kids living on the street, and at-risk and unsupervised foster children. Welcome. Thanks for being here. Good morning. Appreciate it. I'm Cheryl Graves. I'm a resident and book author. So today I'm here to talk about homeless youth, kids living on the streets, and foster kids that are left unsupervised. They all share like experiences, inadequate supervision, high-risk living conditions, no positive role models, and there is no one protecting or teaching them healthy living practices. We have foster and homeless children scattered in 8,000 different places. Although the plan sounded good at first, to place kids in private homes with, quote, normal families, the reality is we as caretakers can't be in 8,000 different places to see to their safety. When we take action against threats to children and build the Yes Village, the children will be together in one place under one roof with caring supervised guardians. This is a plan that can be successfully managed for at least one half of what we pay today. And at the same time, we will be able to successfully help twice as many kids. The YES Plan, My Life Matters, is a solution, putting an end to kids on the streets, helping them to find safety, available nutrition, creative education, and love. This is not another Band-Aid, but a life-changing solution. The homeless cure was created to elevate the homeless and foster care systems to become the best model in the country, not one of the worst as we are rated today. While waiting for just the right foster parents, these children will be raised in wide open spaces surrounded with farming, orchards, gardening, fishing, real life ecosystems, sport and fitness parks, and then at the ranch, which includes chickens, pigs, goats, ponies, and horses. along with safe and caring daycare and revised education. There is safe and appropriate housing, along with on-the-spot medical and dental care, on-the-job training for 16 and over, with programs that are interesting while developing personal life skills. These children will learn more than just growing their own food and building their own bikes, but also about healthy friendships, responsibility, trust, and learn the freedom to laugh. One of the best features of this plan is that families can now stay together. The village is a lifestyle rehabilitation community that serves all ages, individuals, families, and friends who can now grow in a positive environment with specialized mentoring, engaging projects, and when someone needs to be redirected, there is someone there to help. When I battled cancer for three years, the only person I could look at was another sufferer. I couldn't even look at other people. I could only look at somebody who was going through the same thing I was going through. Kind of like the people who went through 9-11 and suffered. They look at other people and they just melt. They were in the same situation they were in. What do you think kids feel when they're put into a home with a normal family? They have nothing in common. Nothing. Aren't you sweet? Nothing in common at all. So what I'm asking is they need to be around people who know, who get it, who've been there, that they can hug and cry and heal. So I suggest a community for them. Thank you for your help. Thanks for your time. Thank you, Cheryl. And thank you for sharing your story. We appreciate it. I'll take the water. Thank you. Keep the box back. Next individual, please. 8-5-2. Request of Craig Rogers to address council regarding trust and local government. He called and will not be coming. He will not be here today? Correct. Very good. 853, please. Request of the Portland Youth Climate Council to address council regarding the need to take action on the climate crisis. Good morning. Thank you for being here. Thank you. My name is Sophie Weir and I'm here representing the Portland Youth Climate Council. I'm a recent graduate of Cleveland High School. What high school? Cleveland High School. Cleveland. And for the past two years, our group has been powered by the voices of local youth and sustained by our drive to defend our right to a healthy future. Today, we're here for the second time to address the harmful gaps in the Portland Tree Code. When the city first adopted the code back in 2011, they exempted industrial properties in an effort to meet industrial, industrial prop, sorry, they exempted industrial properties in an effort to meet a land quota for industrial zoned lands. Those quotas have been met since 2017, yet the code hasn't been updated. What's more, the provision that protects some of Portland's largest trees includes a sunset clause set for December of 2019, which will leave older growth trees unprotected. The Portland Tree Code is failing at its job. Instead of protecting trees, it allows commercial and industrial landowners to destroy precious tree cover, violating our city's pledge to work towards a green future. We call on the city to remove these commercial industrial exemptions as well as the sunset clause before it's too late. As climate change intensifies, preserving an urban tree canopy will prove invaluable. Not only do trees sequester large amounts of carbon, they also decrease local air temperature and promote healthy air quality. These properties will mitigate the effects of rising global temperatures, increase wildfire frequency and intensity, ozone pollution, and more in the city of Portland. We have spoken with representatives of various city departments regarding this issue, including the Bureau of Planning and Sustainability, Urban Forestry, and Nick Fish's office. None of them were able to take real action. We attended a meeting for the climate emergency resolution and found that the city may consider amendments to the tree code come January. However, consider isn't enough in a time when we need to be protecting trees at absolutely every opportunity we have. As one of my fellow PYCC members said in a speech at the recent Zenith Forum, when you see your houses on fire, you run out, but you do not run away. You call the fire department, and today we're calling on you to help us put this fire out. No one has the power to step up to the plate and make the changes we need to the tree code except you. You have the choice to either protect our communities and our climate when it's needed most, or to exchange people and planet for profit. Which will you choose? Thank you. We ask you, what will it take for you to take immediate action to remove the commercial and industrial exemptions, as well as the sunset clause from the tree code? Very good. Thank you very much. Thank you. And Ms. Ware, you have a number of people here as well supporting you, and I just want to recognize that. Thank you. Appreciate it. Next individual, please. Thank you. Item 854, request of John Hollister to address council regarding the value of corporations, non-profits and Portland government working together. Mr. Hollister, good morning. Good morning. John, it's been a while. Welcome back. It has been a while. You've been on sabbatical. Well, it's John Hollister for the record. So I've actually been gone a year. I actually took a new job and I had to move to Michigan for six months. And I never realized that the words polar and vortex could be used in the same sentence. It was very, very cold. But I'm back. Thank you. And Commissioner Fish, you look great and you're in my prayers on a daily basis. Thank you very much. Commissioner Fritz, thank you so much for all of your service and you will be missed. Not yet, though. Not yet, but the, yeah, not today. News of her demise are premature and speculative. Yeah, exactly. Well, I think I know what the problem is. In today's world, there's too much certainty. I'm right, you're wrong. This seems to escalate to anger, rage, hate, then violence. And 18 years ago today is an extreme example of certainty turning to violence. I had business in New York City that October of 2001 and I saw community in extreme pain. But I also saw people with strong and different opinions working together, listening and respecting each other. Cab drivers were even nice. If people with strong different opinions could just sit down, talk, come out of their respective end zones, and be willing to move to the middle of the field, I believe amazing things could happen. So I just kind of had to say that. But now to the topic of my presentations, corporations, government, and nonprofits working together to make our communities better. The Navigation Center doesn't happen without Tim Boyle. The hundreds of new trash cans in downtown and the Pearl District don't happen without the business alliance and the Pearl District Neighborhood Association. There are many more examples of public and private sector working together. This work needs to continue and escalate. My company, ClickBid. would like to follow suit and contribute $500,000 of our fundraising software to all nonprofits and schools, large and small, in the Portland area. Equality. I believe every voice needs access to these tools. Just to clarify, we only help nonprofits that need more money. The ones that have all they need, we can't help them. Here is my certainty. Every nonprofit, large and small, will benefit from using a fundraising software platform. Our software can help every nonprofit in the Portland area raise more money. Our software costs anywhere from $800 to $1,500, but we are offering it free to all nonprofits in the Portland area. I am here asking your help to make sure that every nonprofit in the area large or small knows about this offer. I'm really not sure what that help looks like, but I'd sure like the opportunity to be able to work with someone in each one of your offices to figure out what that means and help make sure that everyone is aware of this offer. And a little shout out that all of my compatriots in Michigan are watching this right now. So hi, Matt. Hi, Tom and the rest of the gang. And Tom and Matt are my two business partners, and they have agreed to this very generous offer. Very good. Thank you, John, for bringing this to our attention. We appreciate it. This looks promising. Welcome back. It's good to see you. Good to be back. Next individual, please. Thank you. Item 855, request of David Potts to address council regarding Oregon Department of Transportation, placing boulders where homeless camps are currently residing. Good morning. Welcome. Good morning, Mayor Wheeler, commissioners. My name is David Potts and I represent the Lents Neighborhood Livability Association. I'm here to address Commissioner Joanne Hardesty's outrage over the boulders that ODOT placed in Goose Hollow to protect the neighbors living in that area from aggressive criminal behavior by outside residents living on ODOT property. The neighborhood was victimized by these individuals until the boulders were placed there. Placing boulders is not relocation. If the city and or county were doing something more effective with the money, they would have built a high rise by now and housed them. Continually adding to the shelter system that most of the outside people don't wish to go into is not addressing our issues. Give them the option of housing, not temporary solutions. If you're outraged by the boulders, you should be outraged by a shelter system, which warehouses people and pushes them out on the street with no place to go. ODOT is not a housing agency. The voters passed the Metro $653 million bond to build affordable housing region wide. Portland voters passed a 258.4 million housing bond. None of this current affordable housing has helped the service resistant people off the street. From 2014 to 2017, we have spent $243 million on the homeless issue. This number keeps climbing every year. Why is Commissioner Hardesty not looking to the city she works for and Multnomah County who have set up agencies to deal with housing? Why are there still people living on our streets? Why did the county purchase a dilapidated building and parking lot downtown for 5.8 million that will take another 16.5 to 21.5 million in years to renovate into usable space? Again, with no money in the budget to run it. Perhaps it is another fundraiser for the poverty industry. Meanwhile, the city is in crisis. It used to be unsafe only after dark. Now it is unsafe all the time. Commissioner Harvesty should be looking at herself or other council members and the Multnomah County Commissioners to address the issue. So far they've spent millions on the problem while not addressing the safety of our neighborhoods. In fact, the county has cut money from the budget, closing jail pods, eliminating district attorneys, And the city continues to decrease the number of police officers we have to protect all of us. The outside people have been identified as vulnerable. What about the vulnerability of the inside people? As long as the criminal element remains on the streets, neither the outside people nor the inside people are safe. Thank you. Thank you for sharing your perspective. Welcome. And we will move right. We are not going to do the consent agenda because we don't have enough people, so we'll push that off to the afternoon. We'll do 856, please. designate Prosper Portland as the administrator of the industrial site readiness program on behalf of the city. Mayor, can I have a point of order? Commissioner Fitts. Because I have to leave and we're going to lose a quorum, just to make it easier for you to manage the agenda, can we just do the second readings in 858, 859 now so they're off the table because everything else has been moved forward? Yeah, without objection. Let's see. 858, please. Carla? 858, authorize intergovernmental agreement with Prosper Portland and Metro to provide Prosper Portland funding for the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall Marquee Improvement Project not to exceed $1.5 million. Colleagues, we've already had a presentation and taken public testimony on this item. It's a second reading. Any further business? Please call the roll, Carla. Thank you. Fritz.
 Aye.
 Fish.
 Aye.
 Wheeler.
 Aye. The ordinance is adopted. 859, please, also a second reading. Authorize an agreement with TriMet for a sublease for the co-location of data radio equipment at Mount Scott in the amount of $55,963. Any further discussion? No. Please call the roll. Fritz? Thanks to Director Mike Sturr, who gave the presentation last week, and to Tom Klutz, who prepared this ordinance. Aye. Fish? Aye. Wheeler? Aye. The ordinance is adopted. And Mayor, just so the public knows, items 860 and 861 are to be rescheduled at the end of the afternoon agenda. Commissioner Fish, would you like them at the end or we can put them at the beginning of the afternoon? The beginning would be great. We'll just deal with them quickly. Let's assume that just because we know we have staff. We'll have staff there and we'll do them in less than the time that's set aside. Perfect. So without objection, we're moving 860 and 861 to 2 p.m. this afternoon. Thank you. Very good. And we're back to 856. I have some opening remarks. Six years ago, Business Oregon's Industrial Site Readiness Program was approved by the Oregon State Legislature, which provides reimbursements based on income tax revenues for private-public partnerships to cover the cost of development of industrial sites that would likely not occur without targeted public assistance. With the city council approval, Prosper Portland Connect is the administrator on behalf of the city, similar to the role that the agency plays with the Enterprise Zone program. Approval of designating PROPS for Portland as the administrator of the industrial site readiness program supports the development of industrial redevelopment projects, including applications of business and workforce equity programs, and incentivizes industrial employment growth and helps connect well-paid job opportunities to priority populations. And this morning we have... We have staff making presentations. Lisa, who I've known for like a decade and see like every other day. I really need more coffee. Good morning, Lisa. I know who you are. Thank you for being here. Ted, next time that happens, just say it's the chemotherapy. You know, I just had a birthday. Am I built an excuse? I just had a birthday, and I think it was a breaking point for me. Thank you, Lisa, for being here. I appreciate it. Thank you for having me. Good morning, Mayor and Council Members. I am Lisa Aboff, Director of Development and Investment with Prosper Portland, the economic development agency for the city of Portland. And as the mayor mentioned, the action before you today would designate Prosper Portland to become the city of Portland's administrator for the Industrial Site Readiness Program, which is a statewide economic development program. The state of Oregon supports the Industrial Site Readiness Program and it was authorized back in 2013 by the state legislature. And it's a program that is managed by the state's economic development agency, Business Oregon. As the mayor mentioned, the program is intended to promote the development of regionally significant industrial sites, which is kind of a term of art that we'll walk through a bit, and to support traded sector economic development. And it's in direct alignment with Prosper Portland's role as the city's economic development agency and would be very complementary to Prosper's other tools and initiatives, ranging from the incentive program of E-Zone all the way through to our our initiative around Portland Means Progress to increase diversity within our workforce hiring practices. The program was put in place to help address the shortage of market-ready regional industrial sites, and what you see here on this map are actually Metro's designated significant industrial land sites. So that is how we would follow suit to Business Oregon's requirements as to which sites would be eligible for this incentive tool. And while the Regional Industrial Site Readiness Project does inventory and project adequate lands, they suggest that land acreage alone is not enough to support the new jobs that we would like to, the new industrial jobs that we would like to see. But that the biggest barrier to a new industrial development in the region is actually making that land ready for development, and that is what this tool is intended to do. This program can then be combined with other efforts and incentives, and is intended to help ready the land for improvement from environmental cleanup all the way to transportation improvements. So key components of the program is a designated site. As I mentioned, it would be in alignment with Metro's designated industrial, significant industrial lands. It requires a public sponsor. So a local government is the only entity that can apply if they own the industrial sites and or act as sponsor for a privately owned business or property owner. As sponsor, we would then enter into the tax reimbursement agreement with Business Oregon, and we would be responsible for all the subsequent reporting and monitoring. It also requires an employer. And eligible employers must hire a minimum of 50 employees whose average wages are 150% of the county or state average wages. And that's about $85,000 for Portland. And the program is accepting applications until 2023. And there's an annual budget allocation to this by the state. Thank you. And eligible costs, as I mentioned, would allow us to recapture some income taxes to cover the costs of land acquisition, planning and engineering, environmental cleanup, transportation improvements, and other infrastructure improvements. And reimbursement is capped at 50% of the total eligible site preparation costs, and our intent is to utilize the program and any funds that are made available through – an income tax recapture to further the agency's job creation as well as our social equity objectives in alignment with our strategic plan. In the near term, we're looking at opportunity sites both within the centrally side as well as airport way, which are designated industrial areas and sanctuaries for the city of Portland. And with that, I will take any questions. Thank you. Commissioner Fritz. I have a friendly amendment to add, and that is to add, be it further resolved that this resolution is binding city policy. Second. We have a motion on the table. We have a second from Commissioner Fish. Any further discussion? I have one question of staff. Is there any objection from Prosper to the amendment? No. Very good. Call the roll on the amendment. Fritz. Aye.
 Fish.
 Aye.
 Wheeler. I appreciate the amendment. I vote aye. The amendment's adopted and on the table. Thank you. Very good. Is there a public testimony on this item, Carla? Yes, we have four people signed up. All right. The first three, please come on up, are Edith Gillis, Jeanne Conant, and I believe it's Cabe Ovas, maybe. Sorry. Who's the next one? Maggie's also signed up. Maggie, why don't you come forward? It looks like you're the only two. I think Jeanne may have stepped out. All right. I am vehemently opposed to this because Prosper Portland does not have the knowledge, the experience, the expertise, the staffing, or the vested interest that we need for the best use of our land for the long-term and intermediate economic development and the well-being of the people of the state. city of Portland and for the city as an ongoing entity. The reason is because their vested interests, their focus, their bias is in preparing quick flat land for big boxes for big corporate industrial development. It does not include any knowledge or expertise in real, true, actual environmental cleanup in having the wetlands preservation and having earthquake resilience measures and having real equity in taking care of the land. We are going to have raising seawater. We're going to have a lot of changes that affect Portland. So these industrial areas that are waste sinks for pollution are not going to be cleaned up, are not going to be having the natural areas that we need to have, and are not going to be integrated. They're not talking about requiring roofing. They're not having the folks that have even a perspective on the long-term economic or intermediate economic well-being and they don't even have the framework of the information they're supposed to be looking at. If you make this a binding decision you cannot necessarily go back and correct it. We're not going to have the city oversight. We're going to be wasting city tax dollars and we're going to be endangering the lives of our workers and our neighbors. Thank you. Heath, could you put your name on the record please? My name is Edith Gillis. Thank you. Appreciate it. Good morning. My name is Maggie Portland, Homeless Town Hall, and I would like to double and triple everything that she just said. And I would like to say that... Not wanting pollution, not wanting carbon is a great thing. And I've been to these organization meetings where they're going to press legislation to put a tax on carbon. But what you quickly find out about these organizations, and these are my people, I mean they want, you know, no pollution and no carbon so we can bring down this disaster that's slow-moving disaster of climate change that is happening all around us. they will take that carbon tax and the financial incentive is to just let them keep spewing carbon or pollution so that they can stuff their pockets with money. And what it should be used for is to... pollution reduction, carbon reduction but unfortunately the corporations they're fine, they'll pay that tax so they can put the pollution in the water and put more carbon in the air they'll pay that tax if that's what they have to pay if that's just the price of doing business and they don't care that it gets in the water and it gets in poor people's drink that water. You know, the animals. The animals, they die from all of this. They go extinct from all of this. They don't care about global warming. I mean, you can't even say global warming or climate change in Florida. It's illegal for employees to say it. So, I mean, we know where this is going. And, you know, Ted, you're a developer. And we need a real... a Democrat, not someone who just puts on the jacket, you know, and goes out there and says the right words. So, thank you. Good morning. Good morning. Jan Kinnett. And I'm going to direct this to Ted because I got told the other day that something wasn't his job. But where do I start? Ted, when I first came back to town, I had to go down to the waterfront and I had to sit there for four months. Ma'am, I'm sorry. This is about an industrial site resonance program. This is about Prosper Portland being an administrator for an industrial site readiness program. Do you support it or not and why? That's what the testimony needs to focus on. Otherwise, you're out of order, ma'am. I'm sorry. It's not about TED. It's about whether Prosper Portland should be the administrator of this program. And you all don't already know the answer. very good thank you yeah yeah just sell out for it and all you want to buddy it's like Who else was there, Carla? There was a coal, but I don't think they're here. Okay, by the way, while we're on the subject, I visited a manufacturing facility yesterday. And I'd like to talk about it because it's one that the city supports. It's one that Prosper Portland's been engaged in. It's the kind of partnership that John Hollister talked about the other day. Institutions working with private sector, working with government. And this one was focused on the private sector. And it's called the PIE Shop, which I thought was really interesting. PIE stands for the Portland Incubator Experiment. And this is a partnership between an industrial design firm called Autodesk, which is located in the central east side industrial area, the Portland Incubator Experiment, and Uncorked Studios. And the purpose of it is to bring manufacturing to the city that's focused on things like the Internet of Things and connected devices, which are growing market opportunities not just for Portland, but globally. These are growing market and employment opportunities. They create an opportunity for shared economic prosperity. It has nothing to do with increasing carbon emissions. In fact, the work that they do in this manufacturing facility could help to do just the opposite. And when I think about the industrial opportunities taking place in this community, I think about green energy. I think about green infrastructure. I think about green manufacturing. And so I would encourage people as you think about what manufacturing is, also think about what the future holds and what the opportunities are. Manufacturing, we all sort of grew up at a time where we think of manufacturing as being smokestacks and a lot of smoke coming out of the smokestack. When I think about manufacturing, I'm not thinking about that. I'm thinking about how we can move the economy forward while looking at things like the green infrastructure, green energy, green manufacturing, and other forward-thinking things. And in this particular case, we need somebody to administer this program on behalf of the city. Okay. I don't think the Housing Bureau is the right bureau. I don't think the Fire Bureau is the right bureau. The police are overextended. I don't think they need to manage this program on behalf of the city of Portland. So it would be my strong preference that we put Prosper Portland, which has already stated its values, showed the kind of results they can get in this forward thinking, cutting edge manufacturing. create a sense of shared economic prosperity so that it's not just the usual suspects making achieving financial security, but that we are in fact including people who have historically been underrepresented. And there's no agency in this state that has been more forward thinking than Prosper Portland. The inclusive business resource network that works with nonprofits and culturally specific organizations throughout the city to support 1,000 entrepreneurs. The partnership we have around Portland means progress, which is focused on equity and inclusion in workforce development. In many other initiatives like Mercatus, a lot of us have gone to the My People's Market. This agency under the current leadership and current administration is forward thinking and we are inclusive and I would encourage people rather than... coming to the microphone and saying things like, Ted, you're a developer. Think about what it is that we're actually trying to accomplish in terms of laying a smart economic foundation for all of us in this community while addressing some of the issues like carbon in our economy. So thank you for my little soliloquy, but I just felt like I needed to respond to that. Are there any other questions of staff before we move this to second? I'm sorry, it's a resolution, so is there any further discussion? Very good. Please call the roll. Fritz, this program is about cleaning up brownfields and getting industrial, good manufacturing, well-paying jobs in the Portland area, and I support it. Thank you for your work. Aye. Aye. Thank you for pointing that out, Commissioner Fritz. We actually now have funded a position at Prosper Portland to market all the programs which are designed to create incentives for converting brownfields to productive use. In fact, our comprehensive plan... is predicated on the assumption that over a period of time will convert hundreds and hundreds of acres of brownfields to productive use. I'll also point out that a couple years ago I did a tour of industrial sites in the city. In this case, they were the various businesses that design high-end bikes mostly racing bikes, but custom bikes. It turns out Portland, other than a few European cities, is one of the capital cities of bike manufacturing. That is now a new industry. It pays well. We are lucky to be headquarters of some of the best bike manufacturers in the country. They make very high-end bikes for very specific purposes. But that's... But that is an example of a diversified economy where we're manufacturing something which we all agree is a public benefit. So with that, I'm pleased to vote aye. Wheeler? I vote aye. The resolution is adopted as amended. Next item is, and it looks like it's 1015 to me, times certain 1015 number 857 please. appoint and reappoint community volunteers to be available to serve on the Police Review Board for a term to expire September 11, 2022. Very good. This is being brought to us by the auditor. Good morning. If you could introduce yourself for the record, please. Good morning, Mr. Mayor, members of the council. My name is Ross Caldwell. I'm the new Independent Police Review Director as of about a month ago. And I am here to forward the auditor's recommendation of a panel of community members for the PRB. We've got... Two new members and two seeking reappointment. I'm sorry, ten new members and two seeking reappointment. And as you know, this is a advisory body to the police chief and the police commissioner. This, the group that you see before, before you and I know that you have their materials and their bios here, as well as a little bit of a synopsis about the outreach effort that was done. This is a result of a lot of work by Irene Konev, who's our outreach coordinator. I think she's put together a very diverse and impressive group that are willing to put in a lot of time and do a lot of work on something that's very important. And so unless there are any questions to start with, I guess I would start by reading off their names. Sure. Sure. Thank you. Huda Al-Hamdani. Isatil Berry. Nathaniel Bamey, Alonzo Chadwick, Maria Garcia, Amanda Greenvoss, Michael Luna, Julie Ramos, Heather Rowlett, and Jim Young. So those are the 10 proposed new members. And then we're also recommending a reappointment for Svetlana Glinka and Joe Pugh, who have served one term already. And we had one member who had to drop out kind of at the last minute, which is Mr. Vivek Kothari. So he's being taken off the list. And we have all the bios for these candidates listed. And has the auditor's office received, and we also have testimony from Portland Cop Watch that says they don't have any concerns about the individuals being presented as new members. Have you received any testimony from any other groups stating objections to these appointments? Not that I'm aware of, no. And is there anybody here who is being appointed who wants to identify themselves or speak? No. Not that I'm aware of. They're all standing before you. We can have them stand up so you can take a look at them. We can just stand and recognize and acknowledge you and thank you for your willingness to serve. We appreciate it. Very good. If there's no further discussion, I'll entertain a motion. So moved. Second. We have a motion from Commissioner Fish, a second from Commissioner Fritz. Please call the roll. This is a hugely important community appointment. Thank you very much for your willingness to serve. Welcome, Mr. Director. I appreciate you being here. Thank you very much. Thank you for taking the time to come here to counsel in case we had questions. That is above and beyond the call of duty, and I really appreciate it. Aye. Fish. This is pure public service, so thank you for agreeing to step up and volunteer your time. According to the testimony that Dan Handelman submitted, the or the statement he submitted for the record. Now of the pool of candidates, there's a nice mix of women and men. Fewer attorneys this time. As a recovering attorney, I would say that's probably a mixed blessing. And a very interesting and diverse pool in terms of community ties and backgrounds. So I think we are being well served by this group. And again, the city owes you a debt of gratitude for your willingness to serve and for your willingness to re-up. I'll just second that. This is not the easiest volunteer commission to serve on in our city, but it's one of the most important. And I know that each of you takes this very, very seriously. You have to approach this with a sense of conviction and a sense of strong independence. and I just want to tell you how much I appreciate your willingness to serve on this commission. I vote aye. The report is accepted and the appointments are approved. Thank you and we are adjourned until 2 p.m. Carlo, what happened to the front of your desk? Oh, it's artwork. Oh, very good. All right, well good afternoon colleagues. We have a celebration this afternoon. And we're going to celebrate somebody who shies away from the spotlight, who doesn't necessarily want all the recognition and hoopla. But Adrian, we want to recognize you. And so I want to thank you for being here, and I want to thank everyone else for being here. It's my great honor today to recognize one of our G4S Custom Protection Officers, Adrian Johnson, with a certificate of appreciation on behalf of the entire Portland City Council. A few days ago, Adrian noticed that one of our custodians was choking. And without any hesitation, Adrian ran over and performed the Heimlich maneuver. If Adrian hadn't acted so quickly, this story could have had a much different ending. And so today we're recognizing Adrian and presenting him with this certificate of appreciation for performing life-saving measures in a moment of need. We're sincerely grateful to you, Adrian, and this council is honored to present you with this award. And in particular, I want to thank you for being one of the people who, when help is required, you ram towards the situation and you rendered assistance. And that's a good inspiration, I think, for all of us. It's a good message for all of us. And it would encourage all of us to learn the Heimlich maneuver if we don't know the Heimlich maneuver. Thank you. And maybe, Adrian, if you wouldn't mind, you could just share a few words on your thoughts and feelings. Can you hear me? Yeah, sure. First, sir, I'd like to thank my mom always told me not to push this on nobody, but I'd like to thank God first in all things. My second thing I'd like to say, on this day, there was a lot of heroes on this day. Everybody remembers 9-11. Everybody know what happened. The firefighters, paramedics, everybody the rest of the team. Anybody can be a hero. Anybody. I'm just happy that, you know, With my training that I had, it just kicked in. So I appreciate it. I really appreciate you guys. I really appreciate it. I really appreciate my company I work for and the people that work here, too. And thank you, Adrian. We appreciate the work of all your colleagues, and we appreciate what you do inside the council. Yes, sir. Commissioner Fritz. You're always so friendly to everybody who comes in, and I really appreciate that. And I also want to thank Mark who's here who is nearly a victim but instead is here to celebrate with us. Thanks to Mark and all his SEIU colleagues who take such good care of us in City Hall. We really appreciate all of the work that you do. You're welcome. Thank you. If I could also just add my congratulations. Thank you, sir. Every morning and every afternoon I'm greeted and then departed with a kind word. And we really, is this the... Oh, I'm sorry. And you are a model employee, and I always look forward to visiting with you when I head out of the building on the Fifth Avenue side, which I shouldn't advertise because that's our secret exit. Was, Nick, was. Was, yeah. They'll be waiting for us now. And I also want to thank... Mark for the outstanding service he and his colleagues from SEIU gave us. And Mark and I have a relationship outside of work, and he actually was very kind to help me in my campaign for reelection. I'll never forget that. So thank you, gentlemen, both. You're welcome. Thank you. Commissioner Hardesty. Thank you, Mayor. And I thank all of my colleagues for this recognition. I just want to say you're the only person in this building who's wonderful every single day. Wait a second. Wait a second. And I look forward to hearing that every morning that I'm in this building. And I just want to say that I had no idea that it was you that was in distress. But you have always just given that warm smile. no matter what's going on and you don't know what that brings to this building every single day. So I appreciate you both. I'm so glad you're still here. I'm working on being wonderful every day, but some days. Okay. Very good. Mark, did you want to say anything? Yeah. I'm Mark Jeffries and I'm a janitor here at City Hall. And I just want to say thank you very much, Officer Adrian Johnson of G4S Security, for rendering me a life-saving first aid when I was choking on food. My family and others who care about me are also very grateful to you. We're in your debt. I also want to thank G4S officers Ovi Griggs, Kirk Robinson, and Sergio Verdusco, who assisted you after you alerted them to my dire situation. And I also want to mention the members of my company, Relay Resources, and a representative of SEIU Local 49, Casey, I believe her name is Felice, and are also here to honor you today. So thank you. I hope I got your last name right. So thank you, Adrian. Thank you. You know, this is the... This is a great time for us to slow down a little bit and take a step back and remember that we're all a family here in City Hall. Things get pretty frenetic, but it's situations like this that remind us that we are all human and that we all rely on each other. And I'm appreciative that you stepped forward, and Mark, we're so glad that this didn't turn out to be something much more serious. If you gentlemen wouldn't mind, the council would love to get a photograph with you and your certificate and you, Adrian. Oh, my God, look at all these cameras. Thank you. Not going to be easy. All right, good afternoon, everybody. This is the September 11th, 2019 afternoon session of the Portland City Council. Carla, would you please call the roll? Thank you. Hardesty? Here. Udaly? Fritz?

Thank you very much. We had a couple of items that Commissioner Fish was kind enough to move from the morning schedule so that we could keep on schedule this morning. We'll start with those items. Item 860 first, please, Carla. Okay. authorize a competitive solicitation and contract to procure electrical switch gear and medium voltage substation transformers for the Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant, project number E10897 for an estimated amount of $3.5 million. Commissioner Fish. Thank you, Mayor and colleagues. We have two brief matters this morning. Quite straightforward, it would authorize a competitive solicitation and contract. So all we're doing is launching the process. We're not accepting a contract. We're joined today by Project Manager Clarence Thompson and Engineering Manager Paul Sudo. As you know, Environmental Services is planning a complete replacement of an aging electrical substation that provides power to the Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant. It's the city's main treatment plant that processes the sewage and stormwater of 650,000 residents. The substation is over 40 years old and is past its design life. And today, Clarence and Paul are here to give us a brief presentation. Gentlemen, welcome. So the Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant main substation is located on the northwest edge of the treatment plant. The plant is located in North Portland at 5001 North Columbia Boulevard. The purpose of the main substation is to serve as a single point of connection between the electrical utility and the plant. It distributes power to the entire plant. And as was mentioned, it has reached the end of its design lifetime since it was constructed in 1971. So our plan is to replace the entire substation. Ordinance 189054 was approved by council for electrical design of the substation replacement. And the current ordinance under consideration is for the purpose of pre-purchasing equipment that requires long manufacturing times in order to expedite the construction phase. The overall project schedule is shown on this slide. And as I just said, we want to order the long lead major equipment now before the construction documents are completed in order to save time during the construction phase. We estimate that we can save over six months of total project time via this approach. This slide summarizes the previous point and also shows that pre-purchase of the major equipment will reduce the risk of issues arising during construction that might lead to change orders. The construction phase of the main substation replacement will be performed by the contractor who has been selected for the secondary treatment expansion program. This will allow the Bureau to capitalize on that contractor's experience in completing complex projects at a wastewater treatment plant while minimizing the risk of outages. Therefore, we recommend an authorization for a competitive solicitation and goods and services contract to purchase 15,000 volt primary metering switch gear, 15,000 volt main switch gear, 5,000 volt switch gear and medium voltage substation transformers for the treatment plant for the amount of $3,500,000. And that concludes our presentation for council questions. Very good. Colleagues, any questions? Commissioner Hardesty? Thank you. I have a couple of questions. One, you want approval to pre-buy equipment when you don't have the contractor selected. What if it's equipment that the contractor is unfamiliar with? The contractor has already been pre-selected. The contractor is the same contractor that is performing the secondary treatment expansion program. Thank you. Very good. Commissioner Fritz, is there any public testimony on this item, Carla? No one signed up. Very good. Any further business on this item before I move it forward? All right. This is the first reading of a non-emergency ordinance. It moves to second reading. Thank you, gentlemen. Next item, Carla 861, also from the morning agenda. authorize a competitive solicitation and contract with the lowest responsible bidder and provide payment for construction of the Columbia Slough Outfall 100 drainage retrofits for water quality project number E10689. for an estimated cost of $1,760,000. Fisher Fish. Mayor and colleagues, we're joined today by Joe Dvorak, Division Engineer, and Patrick Lease, Project Manager. The Bureau of Environmental Services Columbia Slough Outfall 100 Drainage Project, there's a mouthful, is necessary to improve water quality in the Columbia Slough. It is located in the Park Rose neighborhood. This project will construct stormwater planters, stormwater filter manholes, and other infrastructure to remove pollutants. Here today to give us a brief presentation is Joe Dvorak and Patrick Lease. Gentlemen, take it away. Great. Thank you. Good afternoon. My name is Joe Dvorak. I'm with the Bureau of Environmental Services. I'll start by giving a little background on this project, which is the wrong one. This is the wrong presentation. We just have a blank screen. Okay. Can we can we put the next one in? That was the last one. Oh, it's 6-1. All right. We do have handouts, but it looks like we're I think we're there. Here we go. I'm sorry about that. So I'll start by giving a little background. So the Columbia SLU is a high priority DEQ cleanup site. In 2005 the DEQ issued a record of decision for SLU contaminants over two... Carla, what's... There we go. Oh, there we go. Thank you. So this is a photo of the Columbia Slough. The Whitaker Slough contributes flow to it. So to the left of the screen is the actual Columbia Slough. Over 200 city outfalls contribute stormwater to the slough. So an outfall is a pipe that conveys stormwater to a receiving body. So Basin 100 is one of the 71 high priority areas in the Columbia Slough. Basin is basically the area that contributes flow to the outfall. So the city work to implement the record of decision is being performed under an intergovernmental agreement with the DEQ. So the goal of this project is to treat stormwater runoff from the right-of-way in Basin 100, and thereby we'll be complying with the 2005 record of decision and the 2016 intergovernmental agreement. And now Patrick will give some more details on the actual project. Okay, the project, like it was stated previously, is located in the Park Rose area. This screen here actually shows the... The area of the project to the south or lower part of the screen is the Parkroads Middle School. In the middle of it is the Parkroads High School. And there's just a friendly slide there showing canoers going through a slough, part of the Columbia Slough. Looks like Bob Salinger and his family. Might be. Project description, we're going to construct 10 underground injection control facilities to meet stormwater requirements. requirements. We're also going to construct 12 storm filter manholes. We're also going to construct two green streets with ADA ramps. The green streets will be on Shaver and they're going to, there's a crosswalk down Shaver so it's going to be a bump out. We figured that was a great place for the green streets to shorten up the distance for the crosswalk. It also helps with PBOT Vision Zero. The picture on the far left is a picture of a UIC, which is typically the water goes into a catch basin, goes into the sedimentation manhole where the sediment falls out, and then goes into a sump. And the sump then distributes the water to underground. Okay. The next picture is just a demonstration of pretty much the same thing, but the sump's been exchanged with a filter manhole. And that will filter out the pollutants and then go right back into the storm system that's there. Public involvement. There's been a lot of public involvement for this. Public involvement outreach includes the residents, the school district, Park Roads Associates. There's been some open houses, flyers door to door and letters have been sent out to the people in the neighborhood. How many languages did that material go out in? That is a good question. I did invite a PI that is supporting this project and her name is Debbie Castleton. She's right back here. Boy, we got royalty here. Debbie, can you come forward for a second? And by the way, colleagues, Debbie is the public outreach person that's pioneered a system we now use routinely at the Bureau where each affected property owner or resident gets what looks like a flyer. It's a newsletter. On the cover is a memo from whoever has been assigned to the project. In this case, Debbie has been assigned. It's a personalized memo from Debbie with her phone number. Not my personal number, just so you know. It's not a personal number. But it does include her social security number and her bank account number. And it has produced a sea change in our relationship with communities that we serve. Because instead of getting a list of eight numbers that you can call and being put on hold or whatever, you can actually call Debbie and she'll answer. Debbie, the question is how many different languages did we use out in Park Rose? The predominant language in this neighborhood is English, but we also translate it in Spanish because there is a large Spanish-speaking population. And Stephanus Gunawan, who is on our team, is the primary lead for outreach along with myself on this project. And he actually just did a... He went to the Jim Peppers Native Arts Festival. He speaks fluent Spanish as well, which is great. And he also went to the Lewitt View Park Summer Free For All Movies in the Park just recently. He was very successful in that. And the Gateway Discovery Park. and he's worked very closely with the Park Rose School District and had one-on-one meetings with the principal as well. But Spanish is the other primary language in the neighborhood, so those are the two languages. I appreciate that, but I think that the number of languages spoken in that community is significantly more than just Spanish and English, but I certainly appreciate all the work that's been done to really engage communities who have not been involved. Definitely. And we are working to, in all of the neighborhoods, find out what are the languages being spoken. And so if you have some insight, I'd greatly appreciate some more on that. Because it's been difficult finding out exactly how to get those languages so we can translate more accurately. Well, there are organizations like the East Portland Action Plan, which is a volunteer group that meets monthly in East Portland. And there's certainly more than just Spanish and English folks who participate in those meetings. I would also go directly to the organizations like Asian Family Center and ERCO and, you know, I could go on and on, but the thing is that they're kind of in that community. Yes, yes. And Stephanos and I have definitely infiltrated this neighborhood, and specifically in the area of the construction impact and the design impact. the specific homes and residents, the apartment buildings and the school right there has been predominantly Spanish and English, but I do agree. The overall Park Rose area is much more than just Spanish and English. Well, in fact, I think the last time I was at Park Rose high school, I think they said there were 46 different languages spoken. Now, some of them were multiple dialects of the same language. So there's like multiple dialects of Cambodian, for example. And, um, We do translate our materials into different languages. And we have, I just approved a Riverviews that's going out that had multiple languages that... So we can always do better and we'll follow up on the Spoiler and Action Plan. That's a good suggestion, Commissioner Fritz. Thank you. And something that was, I think, you do in parks, Commissioner Fish, is on the back of the flyer you say in the languages, if you need this translated into X. On all of our stuff. Into the 10 safe harbor languages, right? Yes. And then the other thing for my colleagues to be aware of is when I was in charge of the Office of Neighborhood Involvement, we were working on a project so that civics. what is now civic life would have a list of what languages to use depending on I don't know whether that's still being worked on or not but it seems like each organization shouldn't have to do all of that outreach but we should have it agreed right and didn't we used to have a civic engagement city civic engagement committee we do we still do the public involvement advisory council oh yes oh we do yeah oh Thank you. Thank you. Very good. Thank you. The budget for the project is $1.6 million is the engineer's estimate. We plan to begin construction in April of 2020, and we're hoping that the construction will take no longer than six months. Any questions? That concludes our presentation, Mayor. Very good. Any public testimony on this item? Carla. No one else signed up. Very good. This is a first reading of the non-emergency ordinance. Thank you for the presentation. It moves to second reading. Thank you. I just want to say, Commissioner Hardesty, that our construction signs that we put out have multiple languages on them on what to expect during construction. So when construction does start, it does have a lot more languages on it, just so you know. Thank you. Very good. Next item up is time. Oh, yeah. Thank you for reminding me. The consent agenda, Carla, my understanding is 866 has been pulled. Is that correct? Correct. Who has it been pulled by, Carla? Commissioner Hardesty's office. Okay. Have any other items been pulled? I have no other requests. Very good. Please call the roll. Hardesty? Aye. Fritz? I support these items. I just want to note on item 867, the southwest neighborhoods improvements on southwest 26. That's the I know that there are some concerns in the community and I think there's a lot of people wanting to be sure that the Southwest 26 improvements are done properly before considering other projects. And I know there's ongoing conversations about that. With that, I vote aye. Fish. Wheeler. Consent agenda is adopted. Next item is time cert 862, please. Authorize the Director of the Bureau of Environmental Services to execute agreements with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to perform remedial design at Portland Harbor and conduct a public involvement program to facilitate public involvement in these projects. Commissioner Fish. Colleagues, we have two questions. really inspiring items back to back one involving Superfund and one involving Portland Parks and Rec and it's the luck of the draw this week and I'm glad we have a full compliment almost a full compliment of colleagues here to hear them We're joined today by Annie Von Berg, who is the Environmental Policy Manager for the Bureau of Environmental Services. And Annie is effectively one of two or three leads at the city on Superfund and spends the bulk of her time working on Superfund compliance. With the Portland Harbor Superfund site currently in the design phase of cleanup. And by the way, if any of my colleagues need a refresher on what the various stages of Superfund are, what design phase is versus remedial phase versus when we cash out, et cetera, we'd be happy to give you briefings. The City of Portland is taking on three projects to expedite action by all responsible parties. The first project was approved earlier this year by council. The creation of a joint city trust that would pool and cap funds at $12 million each to spur new remedial design. The preparatory plans needed before the actual cleanup begins, and that's the key thing. We're in the remedial design phase, which is creating the plans that actually then guide the cleanup. The proposed actions today address two additional projects. Clean up design for Willamette Cove and an information management plan that addresses the overall Superfund site. We've been working on Superfund for a long time at the city and I've had the honor of leading, helping to co-lead our efforts the last few years. Today is really a breakthrough and that's one of the reasons why we have an all-star lineup of people here who I think will be testifying. And Annie, why don't you take it away and walk us through both items? Welcome. Thank you, Commissioner Fish. Mayor and commissioners, thank you for your time today. My name is Annie Vonberg. I'm the program manager for the Portland Harbor Superfund. So I am here today with our partners, the Port of Portland and the State of Oregon who are in the audience. We are here to request approval to enter into an agreement with EPA for two exciting projects. And I'll give a brief overview of those projects for you today. So before I get into that, just a really quick, do you like some water? That would be awesome. Here you go. Thank you. It's fresh, full-grown water. Yay. Delicious. Thank you. So just a really quick reminder of the Portland Harbor Superfund. This is a 10 mile stretch of the lower Willamette River of contaminated sediment that's a result of over 100 years of heavy industrial use. EPA estimates it's going to take about 30 years to reach cleanup goals at an estimated cost of about $1 billion. There are over 100 potentially responsible parties. The city of Portland is one of those parties. Also just a really, let's be clear, we have the least exposure in this case. Counsel, did I say that correctly? It goes without saying, yes. A really quick recap of where we are at in this process. We have made it through the remedial investigation and the feasibility study. In January 2017, EPA released its final record of decision. Earlier this year, the baseline sampling effort was completed. And earlier this year, EPA also sent notice to all potentially responsible parties that they have the expectation that the entire site will be under a legally binding agreement to kick off the remedy design work. So that officially brings us into the remedy design phase or the cleanup design phase of this project. Like Commissioner Fish mentioned, when we say remedy design, that's really the engineered design for what will guide the actual construction of the cleanup. So as also Commissioner Fish mentioned, to step up to our obligation for this phase of the project, we proposed three projects. The first one you saw earlier this summer is now in full effect. That's the city and state trust that pooled and capped up to $24 million of public funds to help get that expedited and moving along. In return, the city and state will get credit from EPA for those funds that are used. What I'm here to talk to you about today are those two subsequent projects that we've proposed to EPA. That's Willamette Cove and the Information Management Plan. Thank you. So I'll start with the Willamette Cove. This is an image of what Willamette Cove looks like today. It's roughly a 45-acre in-water site that we're talking about here. It's located between the St. John's Bridge and the Railroad Bridge. And as you can see in this photograph, it's just north of that Railroad Bridge there. And for those of you who still can't orient this, just to the south, the other side of the Railroad Bridge is the University of Portland. Yeah, thank you. And this is William & Cove in respect to the rest of the Superfund site here. So it's roughly kind of square in the middle there of the entire 10-mile stretch. So, this site historically was used heavily from the early 1900s to the 1970s for heavy industrial usage. There was a lumber mill there, a dry dock, had a lot of overland work including ship building and ship dismantling in World War II. What that left was a lot of contamination in the in-water and upland area of this site. Here are just a couple photographs to show you and illustrate just how much work was done in this site. It's pretty impressive how much work was done in this cove area in 1934 here. So this is an important site and a site that we're really excited to get working on. It's a priority site designated by EPA, DEQ, and the city. And primarily we designated a priority site because it poses a public health risk. Although this area has restricted access, we know people frequent this area, predominantly those that are vulnerable communities. So what that means is they're exposed to an unacceptable level of contamination. So it's important for us to make sure that this site move along as quickly as possible. The challenge with this site is those that are responsible for the bulk of the contamination no longer exist. So four public agencies got together, discussed the opportunities and the benefits it would provide the public by moving it along quicker. It also presents a couple of those opportunities is an incredible amount of environmental enhancement. habitat enhancement there that's pretty unique for that swath of the industrial corridor. It also presents an increased opportunity for collaboration for the work that's currently being done on the upland that's being done with the Port of Portland and Metro. Excuse me, Mayor. Thank you. Who owns that land? That's owned by Metro. And that was purchased with natural area bond funds, hopefully to create a natural area and to do some connectivity with the trail there. And by the way, when I saw this PowerPoint originally, I asked, why U.S. Department of Defense? We know that there are some sites, for example, in the Superfund footprint where Agent Orange was manufactured. This is much more straightforward. You saw an earlier picture where warships were manufactured. So United States Department of Defense is a public partner because this was a shipbuilding site during the war. That's good to know. Yeah. So this is a great example of four public agencies coming together and moving a site forward that otherwise may have stalled for quite some time. So we have worked with EPA on coming up with an agreement of what that would look like. Basically, the commitment is to move forward towards a 100% design. That's the agreement you have before you today. We estimate the cost of that in water design will be around $8 million. All four public agencies are splitting that equally. And we anticipate that to take about three years to complete. I'll move to the second project that's within your ordinance package. Let me just clarify on that one, if you don't mind. So it's just to design the project. It's not to actually do it? That's exactly right. So this will be that engineered plan that will guide the cleanup. There will be another round of negotiations and a number of parties discussing who will actually do that portion of the work. Okay. Colleagues, Mayor, would you prefer to ask questions on this particular item and then go to the next or hear the next and then ask questions of both? I think individually from me. So can we pause here for a second? Can we bring the camera up and just take some questions and then we'll do the second part of the presentation. So I'll continue with my questions then. So I'm assuming, because I know how carefully you're working on this, that when we get into the actual remediation of cleanup, there will be a discussion about the order which we do things in? Because your map showed that this is downstream from the major contamination area. Do you mean order respective to all of the other sites specifically? Yeah, that will be something that EPA determines. It's my understanding they're working on that in terms of sequencing for that. They will be the ultimate deciders. Great. Thank you. Makes sense. All right. Okay, so let's now move to the second question. piece of the presentation. Great. So the second project in this proposed legislation is what we're calling the information management plan. EPA is currently working to break down the site into smaller project areas to make the work more manageable. This image that you're looking at here shows what we call sediment management areas. Those are in the pink kind of blobs. Depending on how those areas get divided and broken down, we may be looking at anywhere from 10 to 18 distinct project areas for this whole mega site. And so what that ultimately means is that there is going to be an enormous amount of information collected, analyzed, and reported on a small scale for decades to come. Currently, there is no plan for how to standardize the collection of that, how to stitch that all together, and where to house that to make sure that that is accessible to all stakeholders. So the city and state has stepped up and come together to build a plan that will guide how that information is collected, where it will be stored, and make recommendations given feedback that we hear from stakeholders on how to make that information easily accessible, how to make it timely, and how to make it transparent for those that are both regulating the cleanup, who are performing the cleanup, and those that are interested in tracking the progress. Now we see this plan as promoting long-term consistency, gaining efficiencies and adding a layer of transparency to a pretty complex project that we know is coming. So having this standardized and comprehensive approach to collecting this information is critical for the long-term success of this project. And the city and state as public agencies have a significant interest in what the guidance of that plan will provide. So we're very excited to be a part of this project. And I'll just quickly give you an image of the concept in general. I won't dive into the details, but this is kind of representative. with the three blue boxes on the bottom of the type of information that will be developed and will be part of this guidance. So we have everything from environmental data to site maps, and also institutional controls, those things put in place to help protect public safety. So that's all being collected. We are going to build a plan for how that gets placed into a central repository and then made very accessible to the users. Those users include tribal governments, regulating agencies, performing parties, and the public in general. So we do estimate that this plan for the guidance here will be a little over $2 million. We're estimating that it take about two years to complete. And that kind of concludes my overview of that second project. I'll go into this next piece to see if you have questions. Commissioner Hardesty. Thank you, Mayor. I have a question about the development of, the process that you're involved in now. And so this information sharing process, does it include community stakeholders? Does it include like community members who have been following this enormously long process? Absolutely. So one of the critical components to building this is to do a needs assessment. And that needs assessment will be bringing in a multitude of stakeholders. But what we see is one of the most important stakeholders here is the community groups. So we have set up a system both to get their feedback to help guide what that looks like and ultimately help guide what the interface looks like for how they will get that information. And we're hoping this next portion I'll share with you will help in the assistance to build capacity and funding for them to help us in that work. And do we have a list of all the responsible parties? I think as a taxpayer, I'm happy that governments are stepping up and putting some resources in place, but clearly... We didn't create, there were private business interests that actually created a lot of the environmental degradation. And so what's the other side? Let me take this one. There is no allocation process yet in terms of who's responsible for what. And a number of the PRPs, as you know, have taken the position. Hell will freeze over before they acknowledge they have a liability before they pay anything. So this is an example, Commissioner, where because government is, because the state of Oregon and the city of Portland have fiduciary roles to play in Superfund, this is a good example of us using our expertise to make sure that people get all the information on all the sites that, In a perfect world, we pass the hat to other PRPs, or we have a mechanism to compel them to. We don't have a mechanism. And frankly, there's a virtue in my mind to having fewer cooks in the kitchen. We want to work this up with the CAG and with our key community partners, have this operational. It's a couple million bucks. That's a lot of money. On the other hand, it's something that we can move quickly on and share the cost with the state. So I love your instinct. And if there's a way to capture some, to get reimbursed, I'd love to pursue it. But at this point, most of the notorious PRPs are still signaling that it's going to take litigation and other things before they even acknowledge liability. So that's the conundrum that we face. For those watching at home, PRP is Potentially Responsible Party and CAG is Community Action Group. Thank you. Thanks. I love those advisory groups. And something important to note here, along with the trust, the city and state trust in Willamette Cove and this investment for the information management plan, these all accumulate credits with EPA for this phase of the project. So we do intend on getting reimbursed and not paying more than our fair share. I'd be happy to send along the list of the potentially responsible parties to you as well. The reason I made that sort of half-hearted joke earlier, colleagues, about turning to council and saying, did I say it right in terms of our exposure? We believe strongly that polluters should pay their fair share of the cost. The law is joint and several liability. What that means is that we could be within a dollar's worth calculation, we could kind of calculate down the road when everything, when the dust settles, what our true exposure is. If there's no one else around to pay their fair share, joint and several liability means we'd end up picking up the tab for others. So the reason the city has been reluctant to say, put a number out there or say something about its liability is because we do not want to pick up the share of liability for parties that have to pay for their own pollution. And what often confounds some of the members of the public is, well, why isn't the city just owning to some number? Well, we can do so, but we can also shoot ourselves in the foot. The name of the game is for us to pay our fair share, too, but not a penny more. And certainly not to pick up the tab of other polluters because the principle is polluters pay. And so – That's just a nuance that sometimes is misinterpreted by some members of the public as the city's not willing to step up and own their piece. No, no, we're owning every part of the work. In fact, we're being sued for owning it too much. That's not the point. It's that we don't want to strategically start talking numbers and let anyone else off the hook. Commissioner Hardesty. Thank you, Mayor, and thank you, Commissioner Fish. I absolutely agree with you. I mean, but my question was really about how are we putting pressure on the responsible parties that we can find, right? And so I understand that we're not at that place yet. We are. The agreement that you approved a number of months ago with the trust is a carrot rather than a stick, because we don't have a big stick, is a carrot. If you want to join us doing remedial work, we're going to make an investment. We're going to move this process forward. And as a result, we all win. We don't have the stick. The EPA has the stick, and that's going into court and getting orders against people. What we have is the carrot. of saying now is the time to step forward, do the right thing, do your fair share, and we'll actually, through the trust model, the city and the state will invest with you to move the ball. All against the backdrop of every penny that we invest is a credit against what our liability is, not one penny more. That's right. So we go back to the slide. Yeah, I just have one more quick slide for you. This is the last component of your legislation today. This is a proposal to dedicate funds for public involvement related to the projects we just reviewed. We're proposing up to $300,000 over in the next four years to assist in public involvement and public outreach, especially to those that will be most affected by the cleanup. If this is approved, we will have our first funding announcement going out this fall for that. So with that, that concludes my presentation. I have a question on that. So is this a hypothetical commitment? Is this an actual commitment? Is this going to be brought through the ordinary budget process? What is your expectation? That this is a hard commitment and it will be brought through in the budget this year. And this is a cumulative $300,000 per year? That's correct. Cumulative to four years because we expect the remedy design phase for the City of Portland to land to last about four years. And how will those $300,000 be expended? They'll be expended primarily in community grants and activities to support the outreach and education of this area. We have a set of criteria that will be included in that first funding announcement that will be very targeted in helping us in our needs assessment for that information management plan. Mayor, the council will decide in its wisdom how much of this gets allocated to the Bureau of Environmental Services and how much gets allocated to the general fund. Very good. Thank you. Great, thank you. You asked all my questions. We're becoming the same person again. Wait a second. There it is. There it is. Can we take a break? Annie, thank you. Do we have invited guests or people who have just come to sign up and testify? Okay. Well, I hope we have folks listed as testimony. If not, I'd love to invite some folks out. Carla, who's the invited testimony? I don't have the invited. I have the list of people who signed up here. How many people do we have? We have five. So let's bring all five up together. Cassie Cohen, Ranfis Villatoro, Bob Sullinger, Jackie Calder, and Lightning. Cassie, why don't you sit in the first chair? Because I think it's important to hear from our advisory body first. And then we'll go down the line. I don't see Lightning here. Who was the other person? Ranfis had to leave, so he won't be present. Lightning will come up later, he said. Who had to leave? Ranfis Fiatoro. Does our friend from the state want to testify? Yes. Tim? Yes. I'll let the committee speak. Okay, good. Cassie, why don't you take it away? Thank you. My name is Cassie Cohen. I'm the lead for the Portland Harbor Community Coalition. Thank you, Mayor Wheeler and commissioners for having us be here today to testify in support of this legislation today. I just wanted to indicate that we haven't had much time to engage our coalition members in what the implementation means for this ordinance. I can speak for myself that I think it's a good first step to indicate that the city and other agency partners are stepping up and continuing to be a leader in moving forward in the Portland Harbor cleanup process with this remedial design phase. And we, and also in recognizing that communities that are impacted, historically currently are experts in this process with their lived experiences. And that the city has begun to really move in the right direction to partner with our coalition and many other stakeholders. and also in expanding transparency and accountability with Superfund-related issues and healing relations that historically were broken with these communities around... the river issues and other related issues. So we will continue to be a stakeholder in this process moving forward, having regular, we hope, monthly or bimonthly meetings with the city, with BES leadership and the state and the Port of Portland. to find a common set of values. We hope to begin to address historical disparities around workforce, contracting opportunities, as well as you know, working on all three of these projects, we hope. So the information management plan, the Willamette Cove pilot. We have a lot of interest in Willamette Cove. We're also involved in doing a train the trainers for the upland property with Metro. So I can fill you all in on the work we're doing around that. And yep, we're generally supportive and open to dialogue with our, so Jessica Trulikowski will be present at our coalition meeting this next week to share the ordinance components and have dialogue with our coalition members. So we look forward to that dialogue. Thank you. Commissioner Hardesty. Thank you, Mayor. Cassie, good to see you. I'm curious as to whether you've been envisioning how the community coalition could partner with the Portland Clean Energy Fund initiative on some really innovative, creative opportunities to train our young folks in – how to do this kind of mediation, right? Yeah, yeah. I hope that there's some planning, thinking going into that now because every time I see the community coalition, I think of all the opportunities we have to train another generation to be real leaders in environmental stewardship, and if we miss those opportunities, we're not going to get them back. Yeah, I mean we are pretty laser focused on the jobs training opportunities for Portland Harbor Superfund for impacted communities and are looking at kind of all options on the table as much as possible. Whether it's Superfund jobs training initiative through EPA and other means we hope. So we hope to engage the city Continue to engage the city in that conversation and see how it dovetails with clean energy fund. Absolutely. By my reckoning, there's now no money left to distribute in years one through five. But that's a terrific idea to use that resource. And we'd be happy to help you formulate a grant application. Great. Sounds good. Thank you. Mr. Salinger. Good afternoon, Mayor Wheeler and members of City Council. My name is Bob Salinger. I'm the Conservation Director for Portland Audubon Society. Also a member of the Portland Harbor Community Coalition and of the Portland Harbor CAG. So we're here today to support moving this resolution forward. We really appreciate the work of the city and the proactive approach it's been taking over the last couple of years, including the work earlier this year, the resolutions that were passed earlier this year as well. Commissioner Hardercy, I really appreciate your question about holding responsible parties accountable. We are very, very concerned about that and making sure that, you know, the polluter pays principle is adhered to. And it's very complicated, obviously, with a site with this many PRPs. We think the city is making the right choice in taking this leadership role because somebody has to break the logjam and get things moving and show folks how it's done. We remain very concerned about how many PRPs are not in negotiations with EPA and are stalling, and we've seen that now for 20 years. So we do think the city is absolutely making the right choice by moving these sites, starting to get things working, showing that it can be done, and then it will need to loop back and make sure that any costs that should be borne by somebody else are truly allocated properly. We appreciate the community outreach piece. This is an incredibly important site. It's a little different than most of the other sites because it will be a publicly accessible site. There aren't too many sites in Portland Harbor that are truly publicly accessible. So this one really has to meet very, very high standards and we need to make sure that all the potential public uses that could be on this site in the future are truly allowed for. If we make mistakes here, we'll foreclose opportunities in the future. As far as the job training goes, I would just add to that, You know, I look at these numbers and $8 million, Cassie and I were just talking about this in the back. $8 million, you know, most of that goes to consultants and folks we bring in from somewhere else and it leaves, it goes away. We know that Superfund is actually a very good investment from the work of Eco Northwest and others, that for every dollar spent, the city actually gets more than a dollar back. So even with that situation, we're getting a lot back from this economically. But the reality is that too much money leaves. And, you know, this, for better and for worse, is job training that's going to continue to give. We have a lot of brownfields in this city, a lot of the work that we're doing here, the green infrastructure work that we need to do. Whatever we train for this will be applicable in many other places. So it's a long-term and a short-term investment. And I think PSAF is a really good vehicle to think about that. There are real connections to climate change and the core functions that PSAF is trying to get at. So I think it's a really exciting nexus to explore. So I'm there and then just express my appreciation to the city for working so hard to break this log jam and get this process moving forward. Bob, let me just say I'm very pleased that you mentioned the linkage between Superfund and Brownfields. Just like we talk about in the community benefits agreements can we get. seamless employment opportunities in the metro region and different levels of government in public and private sector. So you go from one opportunity to another. Can we think holistically? The legislature now has twice given us a set of tools. This fall, I'll be reaching out to all of our allies to help implement those tools. We have to bring the county together. And we have to bring the school district on board in order to have a robust tax abatement plan, which would allow us to get brownfield remediation followed by affordable housing or other community benefits. So I'll be asking for your help on that. because we have to get two jurisdictions to concur in order for us to use that tool, which will then jumpstart the work we're doing on Brownfield and create potentially a seamless training set of programs, both for Superfund and Brownfields. Yeah, we're very excited to work with you on that. We're part of the Metro Brownfields Coalition the city is participating in as well. We do have some new tools. And we absolutely need to move forward on brownfields. And, you know, we need more tools than what we have, but it's hard to get more tools if you're not putting the existing tools to work. So getting those things in the ground, I know that when I'm down in the legislature testifying, they're asking us now, well, what have you done with the tools that you gave us, we gave you two years ago and four years ago? So appreciate the city's interest in moving those forward and happy to participate. Welcome. Welcome. Hi. Thank you for... I'm Jackie Calder, and I'm with the Portland Harbor Community Advisory Group and have been since February of 2002 and followed it just very closely. I'm just a volunteer, and I've worked on trying to get the harbor cleaned up. It's... When I think of it, and I just have some simple things to say, how I think of Portland Harbor is a way of taking health care for all. in a method of preventative medicine. We know PCBs cause cancer. We know PAHs have endocrine disruptors. We know all of that and we could do so much just for the health care of this harbor just by cleaning this up. So I thank you very much for going forward on Willamette Cove. I think it's great. We still know that heck, the University of Portland still had their track team going through there and saying, oh my gosh, it's so contaminated. Why do they want to do that? But I go to the neighborhood association and I tell those people... Get them out of there because it's nasty stuff. The other thing I worked on, we had a precursor to the information system management. I got to go around all the neighborhoods and ask them, what do you want to hear about the Superfund? What do you want to understand? their first thing for the most part was one information and two a website and this website would be this information system and I hope it doesn't just stay on a real high level where it's just agencies and the BRPs and all those kinds of people that just high-level I hope it reaches out to real people because they need to know how to this Superfund affects their life every single day. Thank you. Commissioner Hardesty. Please never say again that you're just a volunteer. Our city is so rich because we have so many just volunteers in our midst so don't put just in front of volunteer. Okay. Okay. Thanks for being here. Commissioner Fritz. Thank you so much for volunteering for since 2002 on this process. I know that many of you have been involved in it for a long time. there's a lot of talk now about including more voices in all these discussions. I want you to know also that I want long-time volunteers to be honored and just we need that long-term memory as well as the new people coming in to add to the richness. So thank you. Thank you and thank you for going forward with this. This is what my work's about is getting this river cleaned up. So thank you for going forward with Willamette Cove and the information system. It's very difficult to go on the EPA's website and understand all that. So what would give meaning to me is that if we kind of communicated to people, the community. Thank you very much. Carla, anyone else? Lightning. Didn't see hiding back there. Lightning. You're in your normal seat. Yes. My name is Lightning. I represent Lightning Super Connect Home. The law secures to the people the right to a clean river, Judge David Mazzone. Now, my position is I think EPA is doing an outstanding job, and I will continue to do my overview over what you do. Some of my concerns on this is that I want to have more penalties imposed in a faster time frame. in a higher dollar amount and once they go into signature on this let them know real fast it's time to start getting things done you were put on the list in about the year 2000 we know where we're at right now we need to get some things done we have other examples to look at one of the other concerns i have is on the aquatic dependent species i want a more accurate list on What might be harmed at this time on the 64 contaminants currently that we have discovered and I'm sure we have more. I want to have it made very clear that in the Superfund site, once they go into agreement, a letter is sent to Mayor Wheeler, there will be no swimming. in this site under any conditions. And I want to see that letter from EPA sent to the mayor directly. Now on the Willamette Cove, I say this to Metro, what a purchase you made, what a disaster you've just stepped into. And I want you to cover all the costs on the upland. I want you to cover all the costs on the submersible land. I want you to cover all the costs. Welcome to the world of commercial real estate. Welcome to what you bought. Now moving along on the PRPs, the potential responsible parties. If I'm correct, we're over 100, possibly up to 150. I would like a complete exemption on any and all parties. I would like any government entity to cover any and all costs here, especially looking at the United States of Defense. I want to have a report done on all these parties on how this will affect their businesses and how many jobs they will lose because of this extensive cleanup. I want to have an understanding when a lot of these contaminants were put in the river. This was back many many years We must look at the job creation saving these businesses Saving the values of the property I'd like to have all assessed values drop down to zero until we are done with this cleanup There should be no problem tax paid on this type of property at this time there should be nothing. These properties are worth nothing until this is cleaned up. Again to the PRP's, you are responsible for the upland on your land in the water that falls That falls back on the state. I want them to cover any and all cost. Thank you very much. Thank you. Is there any- This is an emergency? That's correct. Is there any further business on this item? Any further questions? Hearing none, Carla, please call the roll. Hardesty? I greatly appreciate receiving this information and certainly support continuing this long process that we have been involved in. Every opportunity to ensure that those communities most impacted are actually benefiting from the jobs that are being created, any opportunity to remind folks that it's not just government who has a responsibility for the cleanup, Any opportunity I have to make sure that we are centering what we're building towards as compared to what's the quickest cleanup we can do. If the goal is to clean it up so that this land is then valuable, that is a worthy, worthy goal. And I vote aye. Fritz? So very slow process as was alluded to with a community volunteer from 2002. When I was involved in it, when the Office of Healthy Working Rivers was going from 2009 to 12, it was not nearly as far along as it is now. So I want to honor Commissioner Fish for the progress that you've made since you've been in charge of environmental services and also all of the community volunteers who've put so much time and effort. And also thank you very much to the attorneys who've worked extremely hard on this project. Thank you. Aye. Thank you, colleagues. This is really a milestone year for us, as Annie Von Berg's PowerPoint demonstrated. This is the year in which council has already authorized the trust, which has been fully funded by the state and partially funded by the city, as was anticipated. And you know it was a good idea because a group of people, whose source of funding will never see the light of day, promptly went to court to try to stop us from doing it. So you know it was a good idea. So the trust has been established. Today we're asking for your approval on Willamette Cove and the information management system. Individually, they are important milestones in moving Superfund forward. Collectively, they are really a day, I think, where we can take pride in showing leadership. And I appreciated when Cassie Cohen actually used that word and said that the city is showing leadership. I appreciated when Bob Salinger used that term. We can't control what certain rogue PRPs are going to do. We don't have the influence we might have once had at the Environmental Protection Agency, although to their credit they have said that Superfund is an area where they're going to enforce existing records of decision and they have set a deadline of this year to get the remedial work done. So recalcitrant parties are going to find themselves dragged into court, pulled into court and face penalties in answer to one of Lightning's concerns. But this is a real milestone. I have the great pleasure of working on this issue with the mayor, but it's the senior staff people driving the work day to day. Annie, our community engagement specialist, the legal team, Mike Jordan, and many others who really deserve the credit for getting us to this point. And we're particularly appreciative of our partners at the state. for really making some history. This trust idea is a history-making idea and shows that we are united in trying to really make progress on Superfund. And I want to also say that I'm very appreciative of everyone who took time today to come out and testify to offer their perspective. We heard you loud and clear. about being fully engaged, particularly in the information management system. And as the least technologically sophisticated person on this panel, it's very important to me that it be accessible to average people. It cannot be a system where you need to have a code and you have to have a Ph.D. to access it. It has to be publicly accessible, and we have a chance to set a standard of transparency here, which will, I think, be a model at all Superfund sites by putting literally all the documents online and making them available. So thank you to everybody who made this day possible. Thanks for my colleagues for the confidence they've shown in our work. I'm very proud to vote aye. Wheeler. Thank you, Commissioner Fish, to you and to your entire team. And to thank, as you said, the entire leadership and particularly the good folks at BES who've been working so hard on this. This is a complicated subject and it doesn't get any easier day by day. But I feel like we're getting very, very close to the tangible phases of this process. We're now into the remedial design phase, the public engagement piece. We're making commitment here to move forward on that. And I can almost see the day where we are in the process of the remediation. And I look forward to that. And we wouldn't be where we are today, Nick, without your leadership, without the executive leadership, and without the community working with us, pushing us, and engaging in a meaningful way. So I, too, am very happy to vote aye. I vote aye. And the ordinance is approved. Thank you. Next item is 863, Times Certain 230. Otherwise bid solicitation and contracting with the lowest responsive and responsible bidder for construction of the Gateway Green development and restoration project for an estimated $3.7 million. Commissioner Fish. Colleagues, Gateway Green provides access to off-road cycling in our great city. Sandwiched between I-205 and Interstate 84. Gateway Green is a unique park and an opportunity to put otherwise undevelopable land to community use. The vision for Gateway Green began in 2005 as a grassroots project. And Portland Parks and Recreation became involved in 2014 when the bureau purchased the property from ODOT. Over the years, it has grown into a robust and strong public-private partnership with the Friends of Gateway Green, or FOG. I want to thank Paul Dickow and Linda Robinson, who are here today, who are past and present presidents of the Friends of Gateway Green, for your enthusiastic support of Gateway Green and for your great partnership with the city. The next phase of work at Gateway Green will include improved access and park amenities like event spaces and restrooms. Now I'm pleased to turn it over to Parks Capital Project Manager Ross Swanson, and also to acknowledge our special guest, the best looking member of the Metro Council, Metro Councilor Sam Chase, welcome to both of you. Thank you, Commissioner Fish, Mayor Wheeler, council members. I am Ross Swanson, the Capital Project Manager with Parks and Rec. Next to me is Sam Chase. So after five years of partnership development, community engagement, feasibility studies and design, we are here to seek permission to go to bid for our construction project at Gateway Green. I've stated five years in Portland Parks, that's how long we have owned the property. However, as the Commissioner alluded to, Ted Gilbert and Linda Robinson have been working on this for over a decade, I think 12 years now. They are the co-founders of Friends of Gateway Green. They have led this initiative. Some of their achievements are securing a $1 million Nature in the Neighborhoods grant from Metro. as well as developing a large partnership network of partners, including Northwest Trail Alliance, Community Cycling Center, and several others. The representatives from them will be here to speak shortly. Let's see. In June of 2017, Parks and Rec and our partners decided we would open the Dirt Lab project, which is a beta project, essentially. We wanted to assess, given the unique nature of the site, It is wedged between two freeways, a light rail and an heavy rail, and you can only get there by foot or wheels on the I-205 MOP. We wanted to assess a couple of things before we dove in. One is will the public public have interest in will they be able to get to the site? And number two is we don't have a lot of off-road cycling features in our park system, so we wanted to sort of wrap our minds around the maintenance aspects of that, the skill level aspects of that, and how we get going. So we opened that in 2017. After six months, we realized we had a pretty successful park. park on our hands. So at that point we dove in to a public advisory committee process, which went about eight months. And what you've seen today, what will come out of this project today is all came out of that process. As the commissioner said, we plan on building public event spaces and gathering spaces. We're going to provide access, better access across the park. The park has got steep slopes, which is nice for mountain biking, but not if you're a little kid trying to climb out after a long day of mountain biking. So we're going to make some of those gentler and a little better for a wider audience. And we also are going to provide drinking water in a lieu which is badly needed. In addition, over the last three years we've been doing habitat enhancements and restorations and we'll continue that work. One other item which is a natural play area, one of the things we've learned in our public outreach as well, Linda Robinson and Metro also add their eyes on this, is when you come as a family of four, not all four want a mountain bike all the time. So a play area is a nice little amenity in addition to. The project has completed bid drawings and specifications. We are currently working with procurement services to go to bid next week, hopefully. This authorization is an emergency ordinance, as we do want to hit the bidding period for winter, and that starts really mid-September. Our total project budget is 5.75. Our estimated cost for this contract is around 3.7 million. That's in confidence. That is in budget. We have a moderate level of People nodding now. Oops. I want to swear my colleagues. I trust your discretion, colleagues. We have a moderate level of confidence in the destination. Commissioner Hardesty had a question. Oh. So this is my neighborhood. Yeah. That is a smog-filled area with freeways on both sides. Have you done any air quality analysis prior to deciding to kick up more dirt in that particular area of the city of Portland? Portland Park says not. Now, I can... I asked the same question of Fogg as I know there was a 30 panel Oregon Solutions process that happened before the acquisition of the project and I know there was a lot of studies back then. We'll have a couple of guest speakers that can answer that question. Yeah. I look forward to hearing about that. Yeah, that's my hood so. Okay. We have a lot of level of confidence in the estimate, mostly because of the bidding climate and the difficult access to the site. With that, I'm here to answer questions, but I'm going to turn it over to Sam Chase right now. Councilor Chase, also Vice Chair Chase, right? Yes, Deputy Council. Deputy Council. Originally, when this thing was scheduled, Sam was not available. When it got rescheduled because of some other council scheduling issues, he was available. Thank you very much for taking time to be with us today. Thanks so much. I'm really honored to be here. Appreciate your courtesy. Sorry. Sorry, Sam, didn't mean to interrupt, but I just wanted to disagree with my colleague. I think Lynn Peterson is the better looking Metro counselor. Yes, but she wasn't my former chief of staff. We have to go with the ones we know. And I want the record to reflect I wasn't here. My name is Bennett, and I'm not in it. I was going to let that slide because I think I'm near the bottom, but I'll take it. Moving on. Yes. So for the record, my name is Sam Chase and I'm the Metro Counselor for District 5, which is the district where Gateway Green is located. And I'm really honored to be part of this conversation and the partnership between Metro and Parks. We have two very high quality teams that are working on projects regularly and really doing a lot for our community's livability. I wanted to... Do a couple things. One is just really talk about the importance of this project for our entire region. One of the things that we know is that we've had 500,000 people move to this region in the last 20 years. We expect another 500,000 people in the next 20 years. And so we're really charged with how do we manage that growth as a region? How do we make sure that we have transportation systems, affordable housing, a diverse and inclusive communities and a whole host of other things. One of the really fundamental things that we need to do as a region is, as we're growing more compactly, as we're creating a big backyard for everyone in our community, how can we make sure that people have access to nature? Not just when you can get to Multnomah Falls and when you can actually get in, but... Or when you go to Mount Hood, those are wonderful assets that we have. Those aren't things that you can access on a daily basis or on a weekly basis as a part of your regular lifestyle. And so when we're building more assets or restoring natural areas like we are here, elements of it. natural area, children's play areas. We're creating those experiences right here in our neighborhoods, in our communities. And it's particularly important that we invest dollars in some of our most underserved areas and communities. And I thank you not only for supporting this project here before us, but – I know at least a couple of the members on council were somewhat engaged in getting these nature and neighborhood grant dollars in place in the first place that we have here. It was part of our 2006 bond measure and Coalition for a Little Future amongst many other entities were involved in helping promote and make sure that we were really investing in our urban areas that we're not investing all those dollars on our outer areas of where our urban growth boundary is located. really in those areas that are still underserved. We have a lot of work to do. This is a really important step in the right direction, but we have much more to do, and I look forward to continuing our partnership. Thank you. One time I was having lunch with Sam, and I asked him, you know, people get confused about metro and where it is in the hierarchy of things. So he drew this little diagram. He said, this is the easy way to remember it. At the top is metro. Then comes the county, and then comes the city. I said, now it makes perfect sense to me. Thank you very much. I like to be helpful. So we have some, thank you both very much. Carla, do we have invited testimony or just people who signed up? I have people who signed up. Okay, let's invite the first five. We have a total of six people. The first three, please come on up, are Diana, Juntoo Oberg, and Paul Ducow. Welcome. Is Linda Robinson on the list? Yes, she's next. Linda, would you come up and sit next to Paul because we can fit four. We can just add a chair. Okay. I just think for continuity purposes, we should have the former and current president of the board here to talk. And I think one or both can answer Commissioner Hardesty's question. Welcome. Hello, Mayor and Commissioners. My name is Diana, and I am really excited about this Gateway Green Development Restoration Project. I think that it is something that is very much needed. Everything that I've heard today is really exciting. I loved the fact that we are going to be expanding the neighborhood and also expanding the undeveloped areas of this neighborhood. I think that's very, very important. I was very intrigued on the water placements facilities. I wanted to know how many water fountains will be available in this park. And I'm also curious how many restrooms are going to be provided and whether or not they are going to be gender neutral because I do think that is something that is a necessity. And then last... The way our loos are gender neutral. Oh, okay. Thank you. And then lastly, the reason why I pose these questions is because there are community members that do not have places to call home. And so they would be, you know, seeking to call home. seeking out areas where they would be able to use the loos. They would be seeking out areas where they would be able to have clean drinking water, because that's something that is really hard to find within our own cities. And to really serve the community, it's serving the entire population, those who have shelter and those who are struggling to find shelter. And so I just... those are things that are important to me. I was homeless for two years and trying to find a safe place or find a public restroom without having to walk into a department store and feel the need to purchase something and being turned away because I don't have the money to make that purchase is it's it's a form of homeless discrimination and that needs to stop. Thank you very much. Thank you. We have someone from the Northwest Trails Alliance. Yeah. So my name is Jun Tu Oberg. I am the Vice President of Northwest Trail Alliance. For those of you on the council who are not familiar with us, we are the non-profit off-road cycling trail stewardship group that was established here in Portland in 1988. Our organization is 100% volunteers with no paid staff. I'm here today representing our over 1,800 paying dues members from the Portland area to support the improvement projects at Gateway Green. Since the construction and opening of the dirt lab, the soft surface trails in the park have been very popular with many cyclists and families looking to connect with nature via their bicycle. Even our inaugural Take a Policymaker Mountain Biking Day held at the park in June with some of your staff members in attendance was very successful with limited infrastructure. We look forward to the completion of this project to help increase the number of parks on the east side and to be able to host all of you for our next ride day. We also want to mention with all of the enthusiasm and success of this park that the council will complete and implement the Off-Road Cycling Master Plan. Because all residents of Portland, no matter their income or their background, should have access to soft surface trails via their bicycle. for recreation and transportation options without the use of a car. Thank you very much for your time. Appreciate it. Thank you. Oh, Commissioner Fritz. Thank you to the Northwest Trail Alliance for all of your work on this project and just physical work in constructing the dirt tracks. So you've proved to be not only an effective advocacy organization, but also people who put your money and your backs behind the work. So I really appreciate that. Thank you. Thank you. Good afternoon. Mayor and commissioners, thanks for your time. Friends of Gateway Green is an all-volunteer, non-profit board. Put your name in the record. Oh yes, thank you. Sorry, it's my first time in City Council. Okay. Thank you. My name is Paul Dickow. I'm the chair of Friends of Gateway Green. I'm a resident of Madison South neighborhood. And we support Portland Parks and Rec and their invitation to bid and our support comes not only as support as testimony, but as a long-term pledge to convene partners, to raise additional capital funding, and to program the site. And we're very excited to partner with the city to accomplish those goals. Thank you very much. You have to give you a grade for your maiden voyage here at City Council. I'd say A-, Mayor? Absolutely. He was very concise, got his points across, and he didn't repeat himself. You gave back two minutes and 20 seconds. You're a hero. I'll use him. I'm Linda Robinson. I'm the former chair of Friends of Gateway Green. And I have a lot of things I could say, so it's kind of tricky trying to figure out what to say today. But first, I want to thank a lot of people. The folks at ODOT, a whole number of them, the folks at the city, the people who worked with Oregon Solutions and getting this whole idea of, you know, who should own it, who should run it, should it be purchased, should it be leased, should it be, you know, all those kinds of things that had to be decided. Working with getting the land transferred out of a right-of-way status so that it could become a park. All kinds of things have gone on over the years. And I also want to thank Ted Gilbert. He's the one who thought up the idea. I just agreed to help him make it happen. So all of this stuff has happened. I do want to address some of the questions that came up in terms of restrooms. There is not one restroom on the I-205 multi-use path. It's several miles long. This will be the first and only restroom that I'm aware of, and I'm delighted as much as anybody else is. You know, there are two or three on the spring water. This will be the first one, and And to my knowledge, there's only one drinking fountain, and that's in the city of Maywood Park, and it isn't always working. So we will have a drinking fountain. These are things that all users of the I-205 multi-use path can benefit from. So that question. The other one, in terms of air quality, Joanne, we – Commissioner Hardesty, excuse me. We have tried several times to do some air quality studies. We have one concern. We don't want to do just an air quality study of the park. We want it to be in comparison to other activities in similar locations so you don't just say, oh, look at how awful the air quality is here when it's equally... probably equally bad in other places. We did make one attempt with a student group from Portland State University. They put up some little things for two weeks in August one year. The problem is that they didn't work if it rained. And of course, it rained three days during those two weeks. So the results could not be used. I continue to have conversations with VBAC Vivek Shandell, is it? He's with Portland State University, and we are continuing to look for ways that we might be able to get that kind of study. We did look at some data that was available, some testing that was done on school grounds in the city of Portland. Jason Lee is very close. The data there was better than the data at Lentz Elementary, better than the data of some of the schools that are in northeast Portland with industrial areas. So it's not the worst error. It's not the best error, but it could be worse. We are hoping that with the planting of additional trees and other things, we will improve that error. Is there anything else you'd like to say? Pardon? I'm allowed to ask questions and then you're allowed to keep your answer. Okay. Is there anything else you'd like to say? Well, the other thing is I'm just really excited about this project. I've been working on it, as he said, for about 12 years. This is really a good opportunity to take a natural area that's of poor quality and to include the recreation and its active recreation, to try to combine those two, without taking the chance on ruining a really good natural area. Anything we do to this area will improve it, and we can make it even more enticing, more enjoyable to ride in. So this is a really good opportunity to combine those two things. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all very much. We have one more, Carla? Two more. Ted Gilbert and Andrew Jansky. Come on up, Joe. Ted, it seems like you've got some explaining to do. Yes, sir. My name is Ted Gilbert. Hello. I was going to spare you guys the minute to share with you, but perhaps I can speak to Commissioner Hardesty's question. I don't want to go without saying the story of the 12 years it took to bring Gateway Green into being would not have happened without some major input at key times from two of your members, Commissioner Fish, Commissioner Fritz. You guys were enormously important to us. And while we're talking about the city of Portland, We've been absolutely blessed by our project manager at Parks in the selection of Ross Swanson. He has been sensational. Now, regarding your question, Commissioner Hardesty, I will acknowledge right off the bat that it's somewhat of a rationalization. Because when we started, when I took this idea, the first place I took it to was Portland State's school. School of Urban Studies and a graduate program did a complete inventory and analysis on this property. They looked at wind and water and sunlight and hydrology and air quality but they didn't have the budget and the money to do an empirical study. I don't have pages of data to be able to share with you but the rationalization came about eight or ten years ago. There was a study about air quality throughout the city and particularly diesel emissions And what they found was the air quality at Delta Park was worse than this. The area around East Bank Esplanade next to I-5 was as bad or worse than this. And the rationalization that we were faced with, do we take advantage of the opportunities that may present with land, unique pieces of land, perhaps public ownership, for recreation, for education, environmental restoration and for equity because at the time we started, East Portland was the most park and open space deficient part of the city of Portland because it isn't perfect or it isn't even what we want. And the further rationalization was 10 years from now, a significant portion of the traffic on I-205 is going to be electric because it has to. We as a community have to do this. So not perfect, hopefully. Thank you. Thank you, Ted. And Ted, thank you for your longstanding advocacy of this project. Without you and Linda, we would not be here today. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Thank you. I'm Andrew Jansky. I'm the Northwest Trail Alliance Advocacy Director, and I work for Smiles of People. That's my pay. A bike changes a kid's life. They can go further than they can walk. They don't have to rely on their parents, transit, cars. They can explore nature. It's basically freedom. Someone invested me in the 70s when I was growing up. Growing up a little 10 year old, I did bike rodeos at schools. I rode my bike at Raleigh Park and skidded down the grass and we made little things at the school. And then I dammed up the creek and I played in the water there and the mud and dirt. And that shaped me to be the civil engineer now. I've designed actually remedial designs that you saw today. I've been a part of those projects. I've done salmon restoration projects, water quality projects for the city and for some of the PRPs. So I've been involved in some of this because of how I grew up. Gateway Green is changing kids' lives now. Kids on economical bikes, kids on hand-me-down bikes, kids on fancy bikes. They're neighbor kids, real Portlanders out there. I witnessed probably one of the more important changes recently where false perceptions and false information parroted for 25 years about the dangers of bikes in nature. Misrepresentation, stereotypes of cyclists perpetuated and fearmongering of impacts to nature. That one day basically, you know, I saw someone's mind change. I saw the look in that person's eye. The information they were fed maybe hadn't been true. People who mountain bike don't all look the same. They're young, they're old, they're families, they're environmental stewards, basically. That person was Commissioner Fritz. The day was special to me because I saw all the happy kids, and I saw the look on your face when you saw what this place was creating. Anyway, so thank you for your past support on this project and this proposed funding, and also thank you to Councilor Chase for supporting the off-road cycling and inclusion of our community at Metro. I hope we can find a champion within the City Council to finish the off-road cycling master plan. It's been languishing for a long time. So we can start new projects across the city to allow kids and families to access nature on bikes. We're a large community, and we're looking for a leader. Thank you. Thank you both very much. Carla, is that it? That's all signed up. That concludes our presentation, Mayor. Very good. Any further questions? This is an emergency ordinance. Carla, please call the roll. I appreciate the decades, it sounds like, of work getting from point A to point B on this project. And I vote aye and will be looking forward to seeing what comes out of this and asking more questions about air quality. Aye. Fritz. Thank you very much for your work on this. I was particularly happy to hear that some of the more steep inclines are going to be, I think, softened is what you said. I remember Linda Robertson and me, myself, before I was elected, pulling ivy on the steepest slope I have ever pulled ivy on. And it was... It was memorable, but actually, as Andrew Jansky just alluded to, pretty much everything about this project has been memorable. It came from the community, but not through the traditional neighborhood associations. It was a partnership between many different areas. I remember signing when we purchased the property from ODOT, and that in itself took a long time to get done. Thank you. the grounds, thank you Metro for extending the time that we had to make the match and then making the match. The opening, oh my goodness, was 95 degrees. I was absolutely dripping just standing there and it's all these families just bombing around on these slopes and everything. It was absolutely amazing and we did the ribbon cutting with people riding through the ribbon rather than cutting it. It's really great. and then being able to allocate system development charge money to make sure that we can get to this day, and then handing it back to Commissioner Fish, who both started and now gets to finish up this phase of the project. Thank you for all of your work. Thank you for creating this place. And thank you, Ted, for just explaining why in 20, 30 years' time, hopefully people will not be worrying about the pollution on 205. They'll be just thankful that the trees that we've planted now have grown up big and shady and are just creating an even more beautiful space. Thank you very much. I had a chance to meet with a doctor over lunch, and we're going over some of my health issues, and sometimes the doctors I deal with wonder what makes someone tick when they're faced with a challenge. And I said that my secret weapon is I love my day job and I feel honored every day to come to work and to do it. And I'm not going to let a little cancer get in the way of that. And the truth is that this is a privilege to have these jobs. Because every single day we get to make a difference or participate in something that marks progress or honor someone or celebrate. And we don't always convince people to report our work in that spirit, but that's sort of the nature of the times we live in. But this morning, I joined Commissioner Hardesty at an event, a very somber event, 18th anniversary of 9-11, and we honored first responders and firefighters, both those who had died and those who continue to serve. It was a beautiful event, and it was only Portland Fire and Rescue can pull together an event like that. You just feel so proud of the people who wear the uniform and serve the city. And within the last 24 hours, we finalized an agreement with Selwood Community Center and Fulton, where community partners are going to be operating those facilities. The best of public-private partnerships and the community uses will continue unabated. Well, that's as good an outcome as you can get in a year in which Parks has had to take some tough cuts. This afternoon, we marked the second and third... of three really terrific projects that are moving Superfund forward. And one of them, with a trust agreement, is a national model. And the other two, just evidence that we can work together across government and with citizens and community members, that we can all work together to make progress. And today, Commissioner Fritz and I get to celebrate with you, Linda and Ted and Ross and Sam and... Northwest Trails Alliance and others. We get to celebrate with you something we've been working on for a long time. I worked on the community solutions piece. We bought the land from ODOT for a scandalous amount of money, although at the time, I think they still thought they got the better of the deal because of all the uncertainty about environmental issues. Commissioner Fritz had the good fortune to preside over parks when there were a lot of developer fees. And true to her commitment, she invested heavily in East Portland and made sure that East Portland got to play catch up with a record amount of developer fees that are funding these kinds of projects. And today, we get to sort of move the ball forward again. It's days like this that remind me again how lucky we are to live in this city, what an honor it is to serve on this council, and how grateful I am for the people in the community that we do our best work with. Wheeler? Happy to support this vision. Thank you, Commissioner Fish. Thank you, Commissioner Fritz and everybody who is involved in this. Ted, Linda, Ross, Sam, thank you. Everybody's working on this. It's a great vision. I look forward to seeing it come to fruition. I vote aye. The ordinance is adopted. Next item, 868. Authorize the Bureau of Environmental Services to reimburse the property owner at 5609 North Vancouver Avenue for sewer user fees paid to the city in the amount of $4,322. Commissioner Fish. Colleagues, this is an emergency item and Sherry Patterson, who's the supervisor of the revenue program, will present. If you could come forward, you should have a memo or I think everybody on council who's asked for one has gotten a briefing. It is, colleagues, it's the city's policy to reimburse property owners for sewer fees. When the city discovers that a property has not in fact been connected to the city's sewer system. In other words, someone is paying charges for which they're receiving no services. Now, previously, environmental services reimbursed the property owner, in this case, for the last three years of fees. Administratively, the Bureau can only reimburse a constituent for up to three years. In order to go beyond three years, we have to come and seek council approval, which is what we're doing today. Today's ordinance, if approved, will authorize the Bureau of Environmental Services to reimburse Mrs. Rutherford for prior years going back to 1993. The total amount of reimbursed fees is just shy of $6,000. Here to give us a brief overview is Sherry Peterson, Revenue Program Supervisor for the Bureau of Environmental Services. Thank you for joining us. Thank you Commissioner Fish and Mayor Wheeler and Council. Thank you for inviting me to provide a brief overview of our sewer billing and refund policy. To begin, I want to acknowledge that the ordinance before you is in response to BES making a billing error. We recognize the trouble that this has caused Ms. Brotherford, and we are sorry. Our prompt issuance of a sewer user refund is our effort to correct this billing error. BES receives requests to waive, reduce, or refund sewer connection and user charges. The Bureau does not have code authority to waive connection charges or user charges and has limited authority to refund user charges. We will, excuse me, we will refund sewer user charges that pay for the city to collect, treat, and dispose of sewage. When we discover or inform by the property owner that the property is not physically connected to the public sewer. Staff has code authority to refund the most recent three years of user charges. We must seek council approval to refund user charges beyond the most recent three years. We do not extend user charge refunds beyond 1993 because prior to 1993, the city charged every property in Portland, regardless of whether or not they were physically connected to the public sewer, a flat sewer user charge. In Ms. Rutherford's case, we previously refunded $1,519 in sewer user charges. That's the most recent three years of sewer user charges. And we now ask council to approve an additional refund of $4,322 in sewer user charges to Ms. Rutherford. The $4,322 is the amount Ms. Rutherford paid for sewer user charges going beyond the most recent three years, extending back to 1993. The total refund then is 5,841. Our bureau requires property owners near public sewer systems to connect to it in order to protect public health and our environment. We collect user charges upon connection and when we identify a billionaire, we correct it by way of a sewer user charge refund. And colleagues, let me just, because I know Charlotte Rutherford has graciously agreed to come today and she's going to be testifying. Let me first say that obviously when Any city bureau determines that we are billing a property owner for a service they are not receiving, that's a mistake. And so on behalf of the Bureau of Environmental Services, we apologize for that error. And we apologize that you received a bill and did not receive the services. And I hope that, Mrs. Rutherford, that you understand that in bringing the action today, which is limited to the question of the additional reimbursement rate, that's the only matter before the council today, we are seeking the additional funds in recognition of the fact that you are a unique case and that you paid the bill for more than three years. Thank you. So we are asking for we do not have the authority under code to waive the for subsequently connecting your property without council action. So we have a bit of a catch 22. Thanks to the property owners vigilance, we caught a mistake and we have reimbursed the property owner for the fees that she has incurred over the years. But in order to comply with our law, we now must connect her to the sanitary sewer system. And that requires that she be charged a systems development charge, as with every other property owner for that service. There is no matter before us today to waive that SDC. It is the city attorney's advice strongly that we not set the precedent of individual waivers of SDCs. Because we could have a flood of people that have either similar stories or equities or concerns or disputes who could seek on a case-by-case basis, a waiver. And we think that, and the city attorney's office believes that's ill-advised. But the most important thing is we apologize for the mistake that we caught belatedly. We are strongly in support of today's action, which makes right, in terms of returning all the fees, or I think most of the fees that have been incurred, And it is our responsibility to make sure we bill people for actual services. We dropped the ball on this and we apologize. Thank you for your presentation. Commissioner Fish, thank you for that statement. And I appreciate both the acknowledgment by the bureau and the contrition for the error, the billing error. I have a separate question. This sounds like a billing error. I'm wondering why it's coming to the city council. And it sounds like the answer is because you only have code authority for three years of reimbursements. I would be very open to a change in code that would allow you to handle this through administrative process. So that you don't have to delay the reimbursement. You could do it, you could work with our customers. You could resolve these issues without having to wait to come to the city council to resolve it. And if there's nervousness about what the potential liability to the city might be, I'm always happy to see a cap on it. You could say that we can reimburse for however many years we want up to a certain cap. And beyond that cap, it has to come to the city council. But I see no reason why this can't be resolved administratively by the bureau. Commissioner Hardesty? Thank you, Mayor. I absolutely agree with you. And I actually was sitting here trying to calculate what the interest would be on 26 years if this money had been in the bank rather than being paid for services that weren't rendered. So that's a great question. Did we apply an interest rate as we went back? No, we did not. We did not. Okay. And that's because the code doesn't provide. I think the code should provide for a reasonable amount of interest. And if the charter doesn't prohibit us from doing so, because there's some things the charter says with utilities that only council action is allowed in order to change things. I think an administrative procedure with the option of providing interest. under the right circumstances is worth exploring. Well, I mean, I just think 26 years is a long time to be paying something that you're not getting, right? And so I don't know that I'm recommending that we just do this across the board. But I do think in extraordinary circumstances, we should be extraordinary in trying to make the customer whole. And I absolutely would love to talk to you about the next steps after we've completed this council action because, yeah. Happy to. Happy to. And the constraints that we operate under and maybe some options that we can discuss. Commissioner Fritz. I also was interested in that question. And obviously I'd like to hear from Ms. Rutherford. And in order to get the money out the door as quickly as possible, we should approve this today. But it might be that there's a second ordinance to then pay the interest if that is allowed by charter. Because if it was a billing error or if it was an overdue payment that the customer owned us, we would certainly be charging interest, wouldn't we? Yeah. And all I will say is because I had both utilities for a number of years, and I had both utilities for a number of years, and have survived lawsuits and ballot measures. I'm always going to err on the side of first saying I'd like to have a lawyer scrub this so we make sure that we're operating within our discretion and not that I don't think that there's merit to the discussion but I've just learned to be a little more conservative in how I approach these questions. That's what I just said. So I'm suggesting that I know you will go back and do that due diligence, but the expeditious thing to do is to get this money out of the door and then to see if there's a second. That's correct. Very good. Does that complete your presentation? Today is an emergency ordinance. It does for me. Very good. I know Mrs. Rutherford would like to come up, and are there other people signed up, Carla? Just Charlotte signed up. Very good. Please come up. Thank you. You may actually be our last testifier this afternoon. Well, we have one item on consent. So we'll suspend the rules. Please take as long as you want. We have no other obligations until 6 o'clock. I don't have a lot to say. Thank you. I've provided a copy of my statement. Good afternoon. Thank you for being here. Thank you. Good afternoon, Mr. Mayor and Commissioners. My name is Charlotte Rutherford. Thank you for allowing me time on your agenda. I'm here to request that you waive system development charges with regard to my recent sewer connection. All things considered, I think waiver of the fee would be a fair and equitable solution to my situation. Let me explain. I moved into my house on Vancouver Avenue in Albina in the fall of 1972. After graduating from Portland State University and working as a civil rights investigator and compliance officer for Boley, I moved to Washington DC to go to law school at Howard University School of Law in 1980. I stayed east for a decade while getting an advanced law degree from Georgetown University Law Center, working for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund in New York City. I maintained ownership of the house and leased it to the Housing Authority of Portland while I was gone. I returned to Portland at the end of 1992 to assist my aging parents. My house was built in 1919. In October 2017, I had sewage in my basement. The repairman told me that city records showed I had a cesspool in my driveway, but that the house had been put on the city sewer system in 1921. I thought my problem was resolved until January 2018 when I had sewage in my basement again. At that time, I found out that I was host to a party line with my neighbor for both the cesspool and the sewer line. The city would not allow me to repair my sewer line until my neighbor party got off the party line. After much discussion, the city allowed me to fix the pipe break from my house to the cesspool on a temporary basis because it is illegal to have a cesspool. This temporary repair cost me $3,500. I could never understand how the cesspool and the sewer line were connected and explanations by the city employees did not help. Throughout this time, I was being charged sewer rates. I contacted the city ombudsman during the process and as a result, I received an administrative ruling that granted me one quarters sewer refund and contended that my problem was fixed. I appealed contending that nothing was fixed and that I was still paying sewer fees that I wanted refunded. My appeal was denied because I was considered a user and a rate payer who was connected to the city system. I'm sorry, the sewer system. My neighbor used his two 180-day periods before he made the repairs and got off my sewer line at the end of December 2018, a full year after this headache started. Once my driveway was open, I'm sorry, it took me until July 2019 to get the work done on my sewer line. Once my driveway was opened, it was clear that I had never been connected to the sewer line. I paid almost $9,000 to decommission my cesspool and complete the work that was evidently started in 1921. I requested of Commissioner Fish a refund of sewer fees paid since 1972 and reimbursement of the $3,500 temporary repair to the cesspool that had nothing to do with the sewer line repair that I needed to make. I received a partial refund of $1,519 for the sewer rates I have paid in the last three years. I understand that you are to vote on the balance of my refund of $4,300, which is what I have paid since 1992. I really appreciate that. However, I have had the house since 1972, and I note that my refund does not include any interest on the money that is being refunded. I am being charged $6,446 for the sewer connection. I contend whatever fees were required were paid at the time of initial hookup and that I should not be required to pay again. I am a second generation native Portlander, retired from public employment as a state of Oregon administrative law judge, and I live on a fixed income. I would appreciate any assistance that you can give me to make an equitable situation for us both. If there are any questions, I'd be pleased to respond. Commissioner Fitch. I have a proposal to make to my colleagues. First, I have a disclosure. Charlotte Rutherford and my family has a long history and my dear wife Patricia Schecter archived her family papers. It does not create an actual conflict, but I just want to establish that we have a pre-existing relationship. Number two, your excellent testimony, very lawyerly in the way you make the case, raises a number of different issues. We are not an administrative tribunal today. We're not composed as a hearing panel. We have an action today, which is to expedite the payment of money and one reimbursement. We can hold off on the SDC for a little while. I recommend that we act on the matter before us. That you delegate to me the responsibility for reviewing with legal counsel what options we do have. Not not what options are preferable, but what options we do have. We would then confer with your offices to see if there is an approach which has a sponsor. And then bring that back and with your with your with your approval. We would take the lead in that piece, and if there's a champion on the council, they would then bring that matter to council. And I think we can do that within the next month, if that is your will. But I think to engage Charlotte Rutherford in her excellent presentation doesn't serve a purpose today, because I need to sit down with my bureau and with legal counsel to find out what our legal options are, and then I will confer with each of my colleagues, if that's acceptable. Commissioner Hardesty. Thank you, Mayor. Thank you, Charlotte. Greatly appreciate your testimony. I want to add my apologies to you. That sounds like an absolute nightmare that you have been experiencing since 1972. I am happy to work with Commissioner Fish and assist in any way I can to come to a I think a responsible result from this situation. I applied your very calm manner in presenting to us. Very lawyerly. All that education helped. All that education, all that good schooling, all that work with your parents in the NAACP. And I also want to put on the public record that we, our relationship goes back a lot of years. Uh, However, that has no impact on my looking at someone paying a bill since 1972 and not getting the benefit of what they're paying for. So thank you for being here, and thank you for making such a clear case for us needing to do something. Thank you. Commissioner Fritz. Chair Giroir, thank you for being here today. And I learned something today that about before 1993, everybody paid a fixed fee, whether they were on the system or not, which we've made some progress over the last 25 years. So I will add my voice to my colleagues that it does seem to me that if the Charter allows us to pay you interest, that will probably hopefully cover at least some of the system development charge monies. But I'm confident Commissioner Fish will look at all of the options, and hopefully we can come to some agreement on the way forward. Mayor, if that meets with your approval, I would just call the question. All right. It absolutely does. And most importantly, does it meet with your approval, Mrs. Rutherford? Oh, I appreciate you taking more time on the issue. The only question I have is you all asked for the payment by the end of this month. There will be no payment solicited from you. All righty. And no late charges if you decide not to. The council has resolved whether they're going to bring forward a matter to further address your situation. All right. We appreciate your coming in and clarifying this for us. This has been a good experience and a good learning opportunity. Did anybody else sign up for public testimony? No one else has signed up. Very good. Please call the roll. Hardesty? Aye. Fritz? Really interesting. Thank you. Interesting for us, difficult for you, and thank you. Hopefully we'll get to some resolution at the end of it. Aye.
 Fish? Charlotte, I'll try to find a way to explain this in plain English to my 15-year-old son over dinner tonight. Thank you. Give him my statement. Aye. Aye. Thank you all. Wheeler? Are you finished? I don't think the mayor is ready. Wheeler? Aye. Now we're finished. The ordinance is adopted. We had one item pulled from the consent agenda, 866. Approve application under the multiple unit limited tax exemption program under the inclusionary housing program for Garfield Housing LLC located at 6700 Northeast Garfield Avenue. Very good. I have to leave in five minutes. Okay. Commissioner Hardesty, was there a particular issue you wanted the housing bureau to cover on this? I, yes, I, I had the opportunity to spend some time talking to Shannon. Uh, and for me, it's the 15 million over, uh, 15 years. And so I wanted to get some sense or if we were actually making progress in that area and kind of where are we as far as these tax breaks, we're going to have a deeper conversation, but hopefully, uh, Director Shannon will answer some basic questions for me for the record. Thank you. Very good. Thank you Mayor and Commissioners. Shannon Callahan joined by Dorie VanBakkel, our Development Incentives Team Program Manager. So Director Callahan, since we're gonna lose Commissioner Fish, maybe we could get right to the questions because I need four people to vote on this. Got it. So, Commissioner Hardesty, if I understand, I have a piece of paper, just we didn't have a chance to do a presentation because we weren't expecting to do one today. But I think you were particularly asking about the limited tax exemption rolling cap average. So, we had set a rolling cap and we have still $10,817. I'm sorry, 10 million. Dori, will you just do that for me? I'm trying to read small prints that I didn't write. You're making my brain hurt. I'm sorry. Hi. Hi. With each application, we have this rolling cap that triggers, you know, goes along. And we are currently with this, considering this application at $10,817,615. Remaining. Remaining. Oh, remaining. Yes. Okay. So we're not even close to actually exceeding that goal yet. No. Excellent. I think the other questions, I'm sorry, did you have something else you wanted to add? Did that cover your question? No. I have like 20 more, but I am respectful. Commissioner Fish isn't here at the moment. Well, so what I noticed on the application that's in front of us today is the units is one studio and one one bedroom. Do we have any data on what the mix of housing has been as it relates to housing? the tax exemption status, and is that what you just gave me here? Yes, so on the next page over is a running tally that we produced for the... Planning and Sustainability Commission. So this data is about a month and a half. No, I think we're a month and a half. A couple months old. But we so far in the pipeline have 508 units of inclusionary housing. Um, And as you can see, 287 of those are programmed at 60% of area median income. 207 are at 80%. And then you can see the mix of studios 1, 2, 3, and 4 bedroom. And what the program requires is not that they reconfigure their building, but that they provide us with the inclusionary program units comparable to the unit mix. But there is an option for developers to reconfigure their units and provide us with the same equivalent in bedrooms. This developer chose to provide us one studio and one one-bedroom, which is basically the same type of units that they're currently offering in their development in general. And so out of the – I noticed – thank you for that. And so there are going to be 28 units in this property, and 0.8 percent will be – low-income housing units or 60% of AMI or 80% of AMI. Yes. Right? These will be at 60%. 60%. These will be at 60% in area median income because I don't want to be one of those people using acronyms in this building. It grows on you. Thank you very much. I think that answers my basic questions for today. I appreciate you. making time to come and give me a more detailed briefing. Thank you, Commissioner. I look forward to spending more time with you about the program next month. Great. Any other questions? Any public testimony? We have a sign-up sheet. Very good. Call the roll. Hardesty? Aye. Fritz? Thank you for your work. Aye. Fish? Aye. Wheeler? Aye. The ordinance is adopted. We're adjourned. Thank you.
