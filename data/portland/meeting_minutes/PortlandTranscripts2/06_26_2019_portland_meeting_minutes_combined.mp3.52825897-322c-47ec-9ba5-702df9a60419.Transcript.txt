Thank you. Now on to communications. Will you please read the first item? 619 request of Stan Herman to address council regarding answering his question. My name is Stan Herman. I think I'm just going to pass out this information. You've got a couple members, Councilman Gullin, so I probably won't be able to really emphasize what I want to continue to talk about. So I'll just pass this if you read it when you can. I'd appreciate it. Okay. You can give your documents to the clerk and she will... Hand them out. Keelan, will you please read the next item? 620, request of Jan Conant to address council regarding the Woonamette River. Is Jan here? Yep. Come on up. Hey, how are you? Why are we missing part of our quorum? Please state your name for the record. You have three minutes. Jan Conant. Yes. Just going to say the same thing I've been saying. Since I've been three years old, I've been marching in the streets to clean up the Willamette River. Twenty years after that, we actually made some headway. I didn't believe it was gone when they told me that the Willamette River is the worst polluted river in America. And I come back to Portland only to find truly it is. So I have two questions to you. Number one, why do you choose to keep polluting it? And secondly, what have you been doing with all the money you're supposed to use to clean it up? Anybody.
 Everybody. I mean, I'm 58 years old. That's 55 years in these streets trying to get this river cleaned up. What was it? After 20 years, so that would have made me what? 33. So when I became 33, people started taking over Portland. They don't give a damn. Is that what I'm supposed to get from all this? Because that's what I'm getting from all this. And it's not just me. Most people just don't have enough nerve to come up here and tell you to your face. I think you ought to make it public, like first thing on your web page, what's been going on and why. And I don't know what he's doing about this firm site. Did he say he wanted to put a harbor in on the St. John's side, just up from the bridge where all that contamination is with those great big huge signs that says, do not breathe this air or you will become permanently mentally disabled for the rest of your life. I had pictures. I didn't bring them this time. What's up with that, guys? That's right at the end of St. John's. That's where I taught my son how to dive. That's where me and my brothers, we... played as soon as we got old enough to swim further than off the dock. Okay, well, that's less than three minutes, and that's all I want to know, and apparently nobody here wants to answer any of my questions. Thank you. Keelan, will you please read the next item? Item 621, 622, and 623 would like to come up together. Is that okay? Yeah. 621, request of Roger Jones to address council regarding Hawthorne Boulevard Business Association concerns. 622, request of Mary Wilkinson to address council regarding Hawthorne Boulevard Business Association concerns. And 623, request of Bill Levesque to address council regarding Hawthorne Boulevard Business Association concerns. Welcome. Please state your name for the record. You each have three minutes. Thank you. Thank you for this opportunity to speak to you. My name is Bill Levesque and I am the president of the Hawthorne Boulevard Business Association, the HBBA. Portland is growing. It is a unique and wonderful city where more and more people are finding home. We appreciate the challenges you are managing to ensure the city maintains its culture, quality, and character as we move into the future. Our district stretches along southeast Hawthorne from 12th to 55th avenues and southeast Maine to Stevens with more than 500 unique businesses, 3,500 jobs and 10,000 residents. Hawthorne is a favored destination for local, regional and national visitors. Our neighborhood, like all of Portland, has changed and continues to change. Structures will be replaced. The question is how do we retain the spirit of our neighborhood? Recent construction has brought new multi-family housing buildings, which is important to our city. We want to increase diversity and that means retaining a range of rental costs to accommodate a range of income levels. A mix of buildings, large and small, old and new, is more likely to achieve this result. We also want to reduce our carbon footprint. This isn't change for change's sake. We are at a critical point where cities can make effective decisions to improve each of these areas. It is doable, it is affordable, and it is right. But part of our success will be measured by how we maintain the treasure of our past as we build for the future. Some of Portland's new buildings will be tomorrow's treasures, but some of these, frankly, do not fit. They don't take into account the character of the city, the neighborhood, or even adjacent buildings. Our buildings have a dominant impact on the feel of the neighborhood. A good design celebrates what is there and contributes to the vibe of the neighborhood. A bad decision can have a dramatic negative impact, a 100 year mistake. We are responsible for these decisions. The design overlay zoning amendments, DOZA, standards and guidelines currently being created by the city are a necessary framework. We look forward to these tools going into place. However, the process needs to take into account the unique identity of each neighborhood to ensure that added density doesn't come at the expense of Portland's unique character. We believe it is important that DOZA tools are implemented with two key components. One, the adoption of design standards and guidelines that acknowledge and support the unique character of Portland's main streets. And two, the requirement that developers work with the community on design prior to permit and design approval by the Bureau of Development Services. The HBBA with the PDX Main Streets Initiative worked with them to shape and then adopt the Main Street design guidelines to ensure corridors have lively public spaces, active ground floors, livable residential units, historic cohesion, and appropriate step up and step backs. The proposed DOZA standards currently set 55 feet as the threshold for design review. But most of the new buildings along Hawthorne are between 45 and 55 feet. We need a second design commission focused on the east side of the city and we need to create Hawthorne design overlay panel with participants from the Hawthorne community. We appreciate your help. Okay, thank you. Next. Next. Good morning all. My name is Roger Jones. I have been here before. I'm the owner and president of Edna Brokerage Incorporated, founded by my father in 1948. We've been a family owned business for over 70 years and I come today as a fifth generation Portland born Oregonian. Founder of the Hawthorne Boulevard Business Association and board member of both HBBA and Venture Portland. In our smallest but distinctive business district, we are legacy to a disproportionate number of buildings that are on the unreinforced masonry building list that this city has adopted. One of which of those buildings was one of our investments as early as 1953. Others may have different views, but I was born and bred on URM buildings. My passion is somewhat proportionate to my experiences. 42 buildings in our district have long contributed to the unique and loved identity of Hawthorne Boulevard. Please notice in your packet a current image of a 30 year old pioneer business, Pasta Works and Powell's Books. The building has sat vacant since 2016, since the date that the city filed its URM list. That was May of 2016, and that building has been vacant now, and the tenants can't afford the URM fixes. As a property owner, I understand the critical need to ensure safety. Life safety protections in buildings as well as a significant and serious challenges to our city's historic building stock will face if the really big one comes. At this time, I'd like to thank Commissioner Fish. Unfortunately, Commissioner Hardesty's not here, but I would still thank her for acting on behalf of the small businesses and the greater community. continuing testimony regarding unreinforced masonry buildings. In your packet is also a picture of a building on 40th and Hawthorne that is a magnet for graffiti. But I will say that yesterday it got painted. This picture was taken over the weekend when I was in a cleanup, and I took that picture because I wanted to remember it. The HBBA asks you, our city leaders, first to ensure the URM list is accurate and does not negatively impact property owners ability to secure insurance coverage, tenants, or financing and make life safety improvements. Second, to increase masonry building owner representation on the newly announced URM Policy Committee. Currently only 16% of the committee members are commercial building owners with the majority of the committee made up of contractors who primarily stand to benefit from reinforcement requirements. Third, to include a committee representative on that committee from the Hawthorne District. And lastly, to explore innovative funding options and incentives to help legacy property owners do the right thing and reinforce their buildings. Small business owners are creative problem solvers. Thank you, Commissioner Fish. We have to stay in business. We have to stay in business. Hawthorne will happily gather URM property owners together for a solution-focused interactive group task with identifying financial capacity incentives and invite you all to attend. The Hawthorne District information could then be shared with the citywide URM Policy Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to address City Council today. And hopefully you're going to be three minutes or less because we're running over. Say your name for the record, please. Good morning, council members and attendees. My name is Mary Wilkinson. I'm the secretary of the Hawthorne Boulevard Business Association, business member specialist with On Point Community Credit Union, sole proprietor and fifth generation Portland resident. As we promote the design of beautiful neighborhoods and well-reinforced buildings citywide, we also need to maintain the quality of cleanliness and the usability of these areas. Hawthorne businesses have been contributing resources at an unprecedented rate over the last year to simply maintain critical problems including overwhelming district trash, graffiti and safety needs. Earlier this month, more than 200 volunteers, including business owners, employees, and residents, participated in a cleanup effort removing pounds of litter and cleaning graffiti around Hawthorne. The HBBA is hosting another cleanup effort before the Hawthorne Street Fair on Sunday, August 25th. The city says one of the best ways to deter more graffiti is by removing it in a timely fashion. As business owners and residents struggle to keep up with the ongoing graffiti issues along our district, We thank the City of Portland Graffiti Program and the budget dollars that fund it. By continuing to fund relief efforts, the city shows that it supports the prosperity of local businesses and the quality of life of the community. We would also like to express our thanks to the Bureau of Planning and Sustainability for the Keep It Pretty Rose City Cleanup Toolkit, which notes, clean, inviting sidewalks enhance the vitality and functionality of an area. It's a fact that transportation hubs... Business districts and public places where people shop, eat, and gather tend to generate more trash. The Hawthorne District is no exception. And we appreciate the Mayor's commitment to making Portland the cleanest city in the county and BPS's proposed five-year rollout of trash receptacles to the highest traffic districts. Providing public trash cans along the length of our district is financially out of reach for our business association. We would like to establish a partnership with the public trash can program and announce a rollout date for trash receptacles and service to Hawthorne at the hanging of our new district banners this summer, which we were graciously provided by a sponsorship from Venture Portland. We are working together as a district and community to maintain and protect the cleanliness, safety, history, and future of Hawthorne. To summarize our request today, the Hawthorne Boulevard Business Association is asking the city to create a Hawthorne design overlay panel with participants from the community. To expand to a higher level of membership by owners directly impacted by unreinforced masonry buildings. And to bring trash receptacles to Hawthorne. Thank you to my colleagues Bill and Roger, attendees and member of council for allowing a space for open communication about our city today. Madam President. Thank you. Commissioner Fish. I just want to say thank you very much to our friends from Hawthorne Boulevard for taking the time to join us. We'll share your requests with the mayor when he gets back. He's currently on vacation. Thank you for the handout, and thanks to Venture Portland and Heather Hale for being here and for all the great work that she does as well. And my son just opened his first savings account at On Point, so thank you. Thank you for that Mary. They have a good matching program going on right now, so I hear you. Good program overall, so thank you very much. Absolutely, thank you so much. Thank you. Commissioner Fritz. Thank you for your testimony. I encourage you to send it to Commissioner Hardesty since she's also on vacation, particularly with regards to the Unreinforced Masonry Committee. I believe that's coming to council on July 10th, so now would be a good time to get your input to her office. Thank you so much. I could be wrong, but that's fine. And I have a question. Have you considered creating an ESD for Hawthorne? Excuse me? An enhanced service district for Hawthorne? We could talk about it later. Enhanced service district for Hawthorne? Yeah. We'd love to talk to you about that. Yeah. We'd love to hear some details. Alright. Thanks for being here. Thank you so much. Thank you. We do not have a large enough quorum for the consent agenda. I guess I should find out first, was anything pulled? No consent, Jen. Okay, thank you. So it will be heard in the afternoon when Commissioner Hardesty is present, and there's four of us. So please read our first time certain, item 624. Authorize exchange agreement with the USDA Forest Service to execute a land exchange in the Bull Run Watershed. Commissioner Fritz. Thank you, Madam President, and I misspoke. Commissioner Hardesty's vacation starts next week, so she will be back this afternoon, as you noted. I'm really excited to bring this item to Council. The Water Bureau and the U.S. Forest Service have collaborated on a proposal to exchange lands and consolidate land ownership in the Bull Run Watershed. The city and the Forest Service have been partners in the management of the Bull Run Watershed for more than 100 years. The land exchange reflects the trust and collaboration that defines this long-term partnership, which has been hard-earned and now is very solid, and I appreciate that. Edward Campbell, Director of Resource Protection and Planning for the Water Bureau, is here to describe the proposed exchange. And we're also glad to welcome Mount Hood National Forest Supervisor Richard Perryman to speak on behalf of the Forest Service. Thank you, gentlemen, for joining us. Good morning Council. Again, Edward Campbell, Resource Protection and Planning Director for the Water Bureau. Here with Richard Perriman, the Mount Hood National Forest Supervisor. Very pleased today to talk about the Bull Run Land Exchange. As Commissioner Fritz mentioned, the City's been working with the Forest Service for over a century in the Bull Run. And we've been working in a formal way on this proposal since 2010, so for almost 10 years. In contrast to our relationship and to this process, our presentation today is going to be short and sweet. So I'm going to go through a brief set of slides, and then Richard will have a chance to talk, and then we'll be available for questions. So if we can get the slides started. Thank you, Carla. So just a reminder of course for everyone the Bull Run is the primary drinking water source for the City of Portland. It's located roughly 25 miles to the east of the city within the Mounder National Forest. And it is that resource along with our Columbia South Shore Wellfield that allows us to meet the drinking water needs of nearly a million customers in the metropolitan area. A closer look at the Bull Run indicates the Bull Run Watershed Management Unit. That's the dark line you see there and that encompasses about 147 square miles. Roughly the same size as the city boundaries of the City of Portland. And the remarkable thing about that is that that entire land area is dedicated to the production of pure drinking water for the metropolitan area. Most of the area on this slide, it's hard to see with the contrast and I'll have better slides later on to show you the contrast, but most of the area on that slide is shaded green, which indicates that it is in federal ownership. The city owns lands around the furthest reservoir to the west, Reservoir 2, in the land ownership split is roughly 95% federal ownership, 5% city ownership. And the history of the city's land ownership pattern really was dictated by when the city first identified and developed the Bull Run as a drinking water source in the 1880s and 1890s. It purchased private land holdings to acquire the water rights. So therefore there isn't really a rationale to the acquisitions of lands. It was just what was available and what could be purchased at that time. So as we mentioned, we work in coordination with the Forest Service to manage and protect the watershed. And that is a relatively remarkable and rare occurrence for an area that is so much federal land. I think it's a rare thing that the city as a non-federal partner gets to have as much management oversight and participate directly in the protection of federal lands in the way that we do for the Bull Run. In 2007, the two parties, the Forest Service and the city, we entered into an updated long-term partnership agreement. And that agreement further defined the roles and responsibilities for watershed protection in the unit. The Water Bureau was basically resulted in the Water Bureau being the lead for the drinking water system and water resources. And the Forest Service being the lead on upland terrestrial resources, essentially the areas within the management unit that are further away from water resources. As well as roads decommissioning and fire planning response lead. The two agencies agreed to jointly conduct trespass and law enforcement, fire response planning and coordination, emergency management and conservation education. So this is a little bit closer look at the area of city and federal ownership within the management unit. And what you'll notice there is what I mentioned before is that the city's ownership pattern in blue is scattered, not particularly close to the reservoirs or drinking water infrastructure. And so through that 2007 process, the Forest Service in the city acknowledged that we could better align the land ownership with the responsibilities that we had assigned out and further defined through that process. So the joint goal really going into this was to figure out a way to consolidate the city's land ownership around the reservoirs and the associated drinking water infrastructure within the unit. So the lands identified for exchange are indicated here in the darker colors. The dark green are the lands that the Forest Service will be proposed to move to the city. And the darker blue are the city lands that will be moved to the Forest Service. In total, it's just over 2,200 acres of land that the city would be releasing while receiving just under 2,900 acres from the Forest Service. The two sets of parcels have been determined by a third party appraiser to be of equal value and therefore there will be no cash payment required to conduct this transaction. The differential in the two estates, the size of those two different estates is basically due to the differing land values for lands that the city is acquiring. We are acquiring lands that are beneath Reservoir 1. Those inundated lands have a lower land value than lands that are not inundated. When it is complete, the land ownership parcel or the land ownership pattern will look like this. The city will own the lands immediately adjacent to both of the supply reservoirs. in the associated infrastructure. One notable benefit of this land ownership pattern is it will bring the federal hydropower project that is on Reservoir 1 and the associated Federal Energy Regulatory Commission footprint onto city-owned lands. That will result in the city avoiding a roughly $150,000 payment each year that it currently makes to FERC. as the cost, basically a rental fee for producing hydropower on federal lands. The Forest Service conducted an environmental assessment of the effects of the land exchange. And that process was completed in March and concluded with the finding of no significant impact. The Water Bureau has followed up with briefings and check-ins with city stakeholders regarding the proposed exchange. Most of the input we've received has been that the of support and recognizing the logic of the proposed land ownership pattern. One concern we did hear early on from stakeholders was the concern and question of whether lands that are moving from federal ownership into city ownership, would they have adequate protections, would they have equal protections to the lands that they currently do under federal ownership? The council in 2010 actually took action in response to some of these concerns and at that time we actually added protections, bowland protections to our Title 21 of the city code. And that those protections, the essential protections were the public closure of the city lands within the management unit and then the tree cutting protections as well as land use restrictions, those are embedded in our code. And as I think most people know, Commissioner Fritz is proposing later today to further strengthen those protections by seeking voter approval to move those into the city charter. So in summary, we are proposing a no cash transaction of lands to better align our agency's respective roles in protecting the watershed. The city will achieve annual savings for its hydropower operations going forward. Watershed protections will remain as stringent as they are in the current land ownership configuration. Next steps would be the council will vote at a second reading of whether or not to approve the ordinance. If it is authorized and the agreement is authorized, what we would do next is work with the Forest Service and Multnomah and Clackamas counties to complete the exchange process and result in a transfer of deeds. We would expect to formally complete that process by either late 2020 or early 2021. So with that, I'd like to invite Richard to comment on behalf of the Forest Service. Good morning Council and I wanted to thank, right away, I wanted to thank Edward Campbell for, and the Portland Water Bureau, for the excellent work and partnership that we've had over the many years. Of course, Edward wasn't here a hundred years ago, but I wanted to thank him for all the great work and being such a great partner. The City of Portland and the Forest Service have been partners in this management of the Bull Run watershed for more than a century. And I think actually the watershed began actually before the Forest Service. So that's an interesting fact. The proposed land exchange is the latest evolution in this long-term partnership. The federal process that Edward referred to for considering a land exchange provides for very careful due diligence and multiple opportunities for public comment. In March of this year, I made a decision on behalf of the Forest Service that this exchange is consistent with federal law and policy and is in the public interest. The exchange will not change how the land is used or managed. The sea land accepted into federal ownership will be managed under the long-standing protections of public law 95-200 as amended. And the federal land accepted into city ownership is already occupied and used by the city on a daily basis. The land exchange demonstrates a deep understanding by both the city and the forest service that water for the city of Portland from the Bull Run Watershed is a long-term commitment and mutual objective of both agencies. The Forest Service is pleased to reach this important milestone in more than a decade-long process of this exchange and looks forward to a continuing partnership with the City of Portland. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you Mr. Paramon for being here. Thank you Edward Campbell for all of your work. I also need to note that Commissioner Fish was in charge of the Water Bureau for a lot of this work, so thank you Commissioner for your guidance of this process. I just have a technical question. We scheduled this hearing today in part because our colleagues could be here and also so that we could vote on it next week. The council has now lost a quorum for next week, which I'm quite sad about. I would like to be able to vote on this. Does it matter if we wait until the end of July to actually solidify this and have the second vote? To have the second reading? No, that's not a problem. Thank you. So we'll be having a second reading on July 25th, assuming that there's support on the council. Thank you very much. Keelan, is there any testimony? 24th, I think. Three people signed up. Lightning, Joe Walsh, and Maggie. Welcome, please state your name for the record. As you know, you each have three minutes and your testimony should be relevant to the item. Good morning, my name is Joe Walls, I represent Individuals for Justice. We support this. We had the question of the safety of the 2,900 acres that were going to be moved from federal jurisdiction into the city. But that was answered in the presentation and I was really glad to hear that. Anytime we get into the water system, we get nervous. So we see it, we only had that one question, it was answered, so we're going to support it. And if I get egg on my face, then I get egg on my face. But it sounds like something that thoughtful people have accomplished. And if it goes through, that's a good thing. And as much as we battle you on issues, we will also come up and try to say when we support what you're doing. Thank you. Are you going to speak? That's what I was waiting for. Well, you've already been called up, so go for it. But not asked to speak. So anyway, my name is Lightning. I'm absolutely against this. And one of the reasons is I think we're just kind of shuffling back and forth and not really doing a whole lot. And what I want to see actually happen is, you know, that statement, we're always taken out of that piggy bank of the federal government. I want to see the city of Portland pay the full value of the $51 million to the federal government. And I don't like the way this is being shuffled. I don't like the fact that I don't think we're really accomplishing a whole lot. We're going to save 150,000 here. Another issue I have here is I haven't seen the appraisal. I have been trying my hardest to find that appraisal where you come up with a 2,000 acre or a 2,800 acre for 50 some million. I was on Zillow last night. I was doing comparatables last night. I was trying to find everything I could near Mount Hood. Never heard of it. So I just want to see the comparables on the appraisal. Now it is interesting you have a 51 million dollar value here. Well, here's something interesting to throw back. If everything burns up, are you going to claim that you are owed 51 million dollars based upon this exchange and this valuation? Now, I as a broker am going to question that valuation and I'm going to question how you determine that valuation. I'm going to question everything on that, on this $51 million. I want to see some comparables. I want to see some data. I want to see some issues pertaining to the lumber, to the mineral rights, to everything else that goes along with this and how you came up with such a valuation on such a restrictive use property of $50 million plus. I'm absolutely against this unless I see some legitimate comparatables, sales, on the market comparisons to substantiate this outrageous value on an exchange. And again, I'm sure you're going to have this insured for the full $51 million, but what is that really going to pay back in the event that we do have a forest fire, which of course can happen because of climate change. And I want to see how you come up with that valuation. Because the insurance company ultimately is going to be looking at this number and saying, where did this number come from? I want to see an appraisal on this. As the public, I haven't been able to review. I don't want this voted in for many months until that appraisal is verified by some other competent appraisers to determine that value. Because this is one big deal here. One big deal. $50. million for 2,000 acres of restricted forest land? I've never heard of such an outrageous price. Thank you for your time. What I have to say is this is going to be sort of a private area for rich people to play. We already have parks around the city of Portland and the county of Multnomah County where... We have city employees, whether they're environmental engineers or rangers or directors of parks, where bathrooms are closed, where people don't have access to bathrooms. Maggie, I need to ask you to keep your testimony relevant to this item. I am. So what I want to know is, is everyone going to have access to this no matter what? No, nobody has access to it. It's just going to be closed off. It's for drinking water. So will anyone be able to go up there privately and pay a fee and just rent it like a country club? No. So it'll be closed to everyone. Except for the first half. So even the mayor won't even be able to get in there, right? Right. Okay, because if you're going to close it off to everyone, fine. If you're going to build a wall around it or just make it not accessible to anyone, fine. That's how it is. But don't make it accessible to a certain section of the population and not everyone. Okay? All right. All right. Could I say some closing remarks? Yes. Colleagues, discussion, remarks? Did you want to say anything Commissioner Fish? No. Okay. Commissioner Fish. Did you want to say anything? No, I am looking forward to your remarks. My remarks and your remarks. Edward Campbell and Richard Perryman, thank you so much for all of your work on this. This has been, as was said, 10 years of work and it's a very solid proposal. Thank you Commissioner Fish for your leadership for more than four years. I need to thank also Dick Robbins who's retired but got this process started way back in 2010. Sarah Petrosini who has assisted the project to lead since 2012. and Janet Senior who took over for DIC in 2013 and guided it to completion. Thank you also to Mike Sturr, Gabe Salma and Christian Niebes in my office for their leadership at this. This is a really good thing and so we'll be voting on it. I misspoke earlier, it will be July 24th and it's a really significant improvement in protection for the Bull Run. Thank you very much everybody. This is the first reading of a non-emergency item. It moves to second reading. Keelan, please read items 625, 626, and 627 together. 625, refer amendment to the city charter regarding protections for Bull Run Watershed. 626, refer amendment to the city charter regarding emergency mutual aid agreements. 627, refer amendment to the city charter regarding public use of city lands for permissive secondary purposes. Commissioner Fritz. Thank you Madam President. First I have an amendment to agenda item 625 which is the protection for the Bull Run Watershed. Due to a grammatical error, the following change is needed in the last paragraph of exhibit A, which you have been given copies of. And essentially, The amendment to the Charter will now read, Development in the Bull Run Watershed closure area that is allowed by the Charter must first seek to avoid, then minimize and mitigate for impacts. So, seek to was the grammatical error. Thanks to Terry Thatcher, retired city attorney, for continuing to volunteer in the community to keep us on track. So I move the amendment. Moved by Commissioner Fritz, seconded by Commissioner Fish. Could we put on that to put it on the table too? Right now? Yeah. Keelan, please call the roll. Fish? Aye.
 Fritz?
 Aye.
 Udeli?
 Aye.
 Aye.
 Thank you, colleagues. I've been the commissioner in charge of the Water Bureau for just about eight months. And as many of you know, I am a person who studies the rules when considering any issue. When I looked at the city code and the city charter for the rules governing the Water Bureau, I was astonished to find there is nothing in the city charter about the Bull Run Watershed. As was noted earlier, there is language in code, but the code is supposed to follow the charter, not the other way around. And the charter requires the votes of the people to change it. The code can be changed by city council. So although there are federal and state protections that are reflected in city code, I believe the Charter should embody our values of Portlanders, especially for the most basic of all basic services, our delicious pure drinking water. I was also troubled by court rulings that questioned the council's authority to make decisions in the public interest for the uses of the waterfront. So I was excited to bring before you today three resolutions which all align with the council's shared value and benefit to our precious water system. Slight change, I am asking today for your support in referring two of these three separate amendments to the Portland voters in November 5th. Those would be the protections for the Bull Run Watershed, which is 625, and authorising City Council to enter into mutual aid agreements, which is 626. The third item, 627, clarifies the City Council's authority to allow water fund dollars to be spent on the maintenance of lands outside the protected areas of Bull Run, and and this leads more conversations and work before being presented to voters. I have heard enough concern from environmental advocates and the Citizens Utility Board since we opened the discussion draft public comment period that I will be pulling this back to my office after the hearing today. If anyone is here to testify in favour, please speak up. I still believe this is the right thing to do, however there are some legitimate concerns and I believe the timing is not right. In the meantime, I would ask for your support to refer the two most important measures to voters, which will allow all Portland voters to engage on these issues in November of this year. I believe that Portlanders share my values of environmental protection, health and safety, and financial responsibility. That is what these resolutions represent. My senior policy advisor, Christina Nieves, the liaison to the Water Bureau, will provide a presentation on these two items, and then we will have two panels of invited testimony. Thank you, Commissioner. Good morning, Councilmembers. My name is Christina Nieves, for the record, Policy Advisor to the Office of Commissioner Amanda Fritz. I'm here before you today to review the two different resolutions referenced by Commissioner Fritz. The first and perhaps the most important is maintaining the current protections for our Bull Run Watershed, assigning Portland voters the right to decide changes in the future. The Bull Run Watershed provides high-quality drinking water to the Portland metro area. Many people brag about the quality of Portland's water, and anecdotally I can say I have taken the quality of our water for granted. I'm harshly reminded of how lucky we have it here whenever I travel. The current protections in the Bull Run closure area, including restricting public access on city lands, not only provide safe and usable water, but also have positive impacts on ecosystems and support the city's environmental goals. The first resolution asks Portland voters to place current protections that we our city charter so that they are able to stand the test of time and changes in authority. The second item allows city council to allow the Water Bureau to enter into emergency mutual aid agreements with other jurisdictions. This will essentially ask the voters whether they want the ability to receive aid and related to water services as well as supply it to other communities when necessary. During Hurricane Katrina, for example, city staff were dispatched to aid in maintaining and repairing crucial infrastructure. It was the right thing to do. A judge then questioned the city council's authority to send that aid. The second resolution provides clarity in answering that question. These two referrals, which will be separate ballot measures, seek to benefit the water system and those who use it. By referring these items to the November 5th, 2019 ballot, Portland voters will have an opportunity to engage and decide on issues in environmental protections and health and safety in a timely manner. That concludes my portion of the presentation. I would like to now turn it over to our invited guests. Our first panel, we have Regna Merritt from Physicians for Social Responsibility, Janice Thompson from the Community Utility Board, and Mike Wilk from Urban Green Space Institute. Thank you. Welcome. Thank you all for being here. Regna, would you like to start, please? Thank you very much. It's an honor to be here today to address the legacy issue of Bull Run. measure, or resolutions that deals with 625. I'm here to speak in support of that, and I appreciate your pulling back on 627, which we consider to be controversial. There's a huge legacy to be discussed here today, and I just want to recall for a moment that although my work on bull run protections began in 88, I spent time in the city archives reviewing what had been done in the 1800s. The forefathers and the foremothers in Portland wanted to have a watershed that was fully protected from human trespass because they wanted to protect residents of the city from having to drink the waste that was coming from the Willamette untreated and treated human waste. And so that was the impetus that and deciding that we didn't want to have domestic animals putting waste into our drinking water was one of the original incentives for moving forward with the whole idea of no trespass. So in 1904, the Trespass Act was passed, and that prevented the entry of humans into the watershed if they were going to disturb the watershed in any way. Some of you may remember that in 1950 the Forest Service started logging in the Bull Run, violating the terms of that federal legislation. And it was then that Joe Miller, and today is the anniversary of his death, I want to remember what a great hero he was and he was a personal mentor as well, I want to acknowledge. um, um, thoughts from the 50s that violation of, of the 1904 Trespass Act. And, um, there was a very huge citizen-led effort to correct that. Um, but instead, what we saw was a law passed to void the 1904 Trespass Act until allow logging, um, Many in this room and many who are watching on TV today remember what it took to get the City of Portland to, and the Water Bureau to agree to support federal legislation that would again protect the Bull Run from trespass. And so we had important legislation in 1996 and again federal legislation in 2001 that brought those protections back. These were hard fought battles and it's really nice to be on the same page with the city now because it wasn't always like that. So we have to look, as we look at the land exchange, we understand that we're losing those hard fought protections for a certain subset of lands. Those are the lands around the reservoir. So they might be most attractive for development if a future city council or water bureau wanted to kind of the understanding that we've come to that could happen more easily with only land ordinances in place, not so easily with a charter amendment in place. That's why we support this charter. We know there are other cities that have actually cut their municipal watersheds to raise money, and we would never want that to happen. So... Just a reminder that it's not just for the citizens who have benefited from an undisturbed watershed, but there are also businesses that are located here because of the clean drinking water. Microbreweries, Japanese restaurants, we have a whole slew of incredible businesses here that rely upon the clean drinking water, and that comes from an undisturbed watershed with no trespass. So I'm here with Physicians for Social Responsibility to congratulate you on putting this forward and to add our support, our very strong support. There will always be vigilance required when it comes to our drinking water. We've seen that over 100 years. This is a very important step to protecting it. Thank you very much. Thank you for being here today. Thank you for all of your work over many decades on this issue. I was honored to attend your retirement from Physicians for Social Responsibility on Sunday, along with Multnomah County Chair Kafori and many other well-wishers. So I think our entire community owes you a huge debt. Thank you for being here today. It's very fitting that we're doing this as you move on to other things. Thank you very much.
 Welcome. Janice Thompson, Oregon Citizens Utility Board, or CUBB. I wholeheartedly support the bull run protections provisions. This was actually foreshadowed by comments I made during the discussion a couple summers ago now. Related to how to address losing the cryptosporidium treatment variants. That variance process included any number of protections to the watershed. And so I think there were valid concerns raised then that if those concerns were dealt in a different way by the subsequent treatment decision to go with the filtration plant, was something along these lines necessary. And so, you know, at that point in time, I indicated that, you know, that could be an appropriate, you know, next step. Support it now, kind of just highlighting that this support is kind of foreshadowed by some previous comments. Given our role as a fiscal watchdog, however, I would be remiss if I do not bring to this discussion information about the cost of special elections, which are borne by the pertinent Bureau. So, estimates from Multnomah County, and to be clear, they are estimates. The actual bill to the Water Bureau only comes after the election because turnout is one factor in their cost calculation allocation formula. The Multnomah County elections folks have been doing this a long time, so I think it's fair to say that these estimates are in the ballpark. With one Portland measure, along with the anticipated Metro bond, the cost for the Water Bureau would be in the ballpark of $245,000-$250,000. With two, the cost to the Bureau would be in the ballpark of $335,000. In other words, the cost doesn't double, but it adds. So, and if these measures were on the 2020 ballot, a non-special election, there would be no cost. So I find a far more compelling reason to do the Bull Run resolution now. I mean, I would not be bent out of shape if it moved to 2020, but I find a more compelling reason to move on that now. I do have questions related to the mutual aid issue. Charter Amendment, not on the basic purpose or intent of it, but whether or not a little bit more work would be prudent to kind of have it be more comprehensive. And so, for example, both the Water Bureau and the Bureau of Environmental Services are members of an Oregon network related of utility bureaus called ORBWARN. And my understanding from the Water Bureau is a charter change is not needed for the Water Bureau to continue that membership. Of course, I see the value of agreements with out of state entities. And that in particular is what would be, I think, facilitated by this particular charter amendment. A question I've had, and the catch, of course, I can't ask questions of the city attorney, is does the same legal issue that is prompting this move, suggested move regarding to the Water Bureau, apply to BES? Even if it does, you know, exactly how that might be fixed, I mean, BES definitely has provisions in the charter, you know, maybe more provisions about BES are required. in statute. And then the other question, but it just seems like, you know, I'm really comfortable with saying, let's just kind of move ahead on 2019. Let's take a look to see if something similar is also prudent for BES. And it's what we thought was we'll give this one a whirl and if the voters like this one, we'll look to BES. I'm sorry, what? We will ask the voters on this one. This is an amendment to the Water Bureau section of the charter. If the voters approve this, then we can also look at doing a similar way. Right, or you could do both in 2020. I'm not doing two campaigns, Janice. All right. And besides which, we don't know when the big one is going to hit. So I think getting these mutual aid agreements done as soon as possible is in public interest. I think the other question I have is whether it would be prudent to think about a more city-wide policy about mutual aid. So the end result of these deliberations may be that this is exactly the one to move forward As I say, I just don't see as compelling a reason to move forward without this analysis about other pieces of the puzzle. Thank you, James. I want to reiterate the full support for what I think is the most critical charter amendment related to the bull run protection. Thank you very much. Good morning. My name is Mike Houck. I'm here representing the Urban Green Spaces Institute. And about this time 44 years ago, 1975, I sat before a congressional hearing on Bull Run at which at the time who was in charge of the Water Bureau actually was proposing federal legislation that would weaken protection of bull runs. So it pleases me no end to be here today, 44 years later, to thank Commissioner Fritz and the entire council, by the way, for being a much more progressive forward thinking individual and organization with regard to environmental issues. And I'm unequivocal in our support for both of the measures before us today. And I'd like to add that I'm also very supportive of the concept of the measure that's been pulled, I think for example of Pal Butte. What would Pal Butte be today if there weren't the ability for the Water Bureau to work with the Park Bureau and others? Another example, there are of course hydro parks in North Portland that I think have greatly enhanced the livability of those neighborhoods. So I understand and support the fact that there needs to be a little more refinement of the language to tighten it as much as possible. But I think that's a classic example of trying to tear down some of the silos that we keep talking about wanting to attack in the city and have more cooperation between bureaus and with bureaus and the public. So we're here, Urban Green Spaces Institute, to thank you and to urge your support. Thank you very much. Our second panel is Steve Weiss from the Sandy River Basin Watershed Council, Courtney Ray from BARC, and Micah Meskel from the Audubon Society. And we are a little bit behind schedule, so if you can be brief, that would be great. Thank you. Good morning, Commissioners. My name is Steve Wise. I'm Executive Director of the Sandy River Watershed Council. Thanks for the opportunity to come and talk to you about the importance of the bull run for the city as well as the broader region. As if it weren't enough to have one of the world's best water supplies, it's important to understand that the The Bull Run is also the foundation of our economy, our community's health and culture and quality of life. We like to say in the Sandy that the Bull Run is the source of all the beer and beer vana, all the coffee and coffee topia, and so many of the things that really make it a special place to be here. As well, the Water Bureau and the Forest Service and the Watershed Council are part of a 15 agency partnership working throughout the Sandy River Basin for protection and restoration of the watershed and its many values. Particularly as a wild salmon stronghold, that is. One of the few places in the region where the wild salmon have a really great chance of recovery since the Marmot Dam was removed in 2007 by PGE. So the Water Bureau and the Watershed Council collaborated on the State of the Sandy report a couple years ago. With the remarkable finding that three of the four federally listed wild salmon species in the Sandy have begun to recover their population since the removal of dams in the watershed. And the protections in the bull run for temperature and for flow and habitat quality are an essential part of that effort in bolstering salmon populations in the Sandy. The Water Bureau has been collaborating on monitoring of the fish populations, particularly juveniles in the basin. And find a remarkable finding that almost half or more of the juvenile steelhead in the entire Sandy Basin are using the Bull Run in their migration out of the basin on the way to the ocean. And the Bull Run and the little Sandy there within the Bull Run watershed represent only a couple percent of all the available stream miles for fish. And yet almost half of those steelhead are using the Bull Run. So it's really essential for fish habitat and environmental quality there. And these protections are really essential. yielding about 4,000 adult steelhead returning to the basin on average in the past few years, which is a huge recovery level. Secondly, the investments from the Habitat Conservation Plan, the HCP that the city is investing in, are essential to habitat recovery and improvements throughout the Sandy Basin beyond the Bull Rug. We are collaborating this summer on a project at the junction of the Sandy and the Salmon Rivers that's recovering floodplain habitat and side channels that will help to continue boosting salmon productivity. And the investment from the Habitat Conservation Plan and the partnership on land where the city has captured a conservation easement are, again, examples of really essential support that the Water Bureau and its actions in the Bull Run are providing to the broader Sandy Basin. And then finally, the third item that I wanted to emphasize is that Sandy has been documented by the US EPA as a cold water refuge to the lower Columbia. That is the temperature in the Sandy River in the hottest part of the year is three degrees cooler Celsius than the Columbia is. And the Columbia temperatures might be lethal to fish, so they need to find these refuges along the way where they can step out into cold, clean water, rest, and then move on upriver. The Sandy is the only cold water refuge identified like that for 30 miles in either direction on the Columbia. So again, these temperature, everything that we can do to maintain the cool temperatures of the Sandy during the summer are really essential to the broader regional recovery and climate resiliency because that cold water input is not only essential to the Sandy, to recreation and fish habitat, but also potentially to regional recovery in the Columbia. So for all these reasons, I want to encourage the strengthening of protections including in city charter. I want to invite you to come join us and visit the Sandy at your earliest convenience to see this work in action and continue the partnership that we have with the Water Bureau and the broad partnership that is working for recovery in the Sandy and the Columbia Basin. Thank you for being here today. That was really interesting. Courtney? Thank you, Commissioners. I'm representing BARC. We are a watchdog group focused on the Mount Hood National Forest. For 20 years, we've been working with concerned community members and volunteers to monitor the Forest Services management of the public lands. We represent over 25,000 contributing members and an additional about 15,000 supporters for almost 50,000 folks in the region surrounding Mount Hood that we count as our community. And also thank you to Ms. Merritt and Mr. Houck for the context on federal management. These things shift, sometimes dramatically. And so we are really encouraged and supportive of the resolution to enshrine these protections for bull run into the city charter. We also think it's an important step in the city's commitment to climate resilience, ensuring that no matter what administration at the federal level, Portland will have the ability to defend the highest level of protections for these national forest lands that provide our drinking water, shielding the watershed from industrial development or logging. We hope the city will continue forward in these type of efforts, leveraging the future of our communities and the power of the city government to protect all the waters of Mount Hood. As we know, we are going to need every drop of it, not just the bull run, and every drop of it is precious. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Commissioners, my name is Micah Meskel and I'm with Portland Audubon. And I'm representing the organization and our 15,000 members in the region. So Portland Audubon has long been invested in protecting the Bull Run watershed and the city's water resources. We own and manage land adjacent to the watershed and are very invested in the stewardship of the region. I'd like to thank Commissioner Fritz and her staff for bringing this forward and for the leadership of the Water Bureau and how that has built upon Commissioner Fish's work on At the water bureau preceding that. So we support both 625 and 626 and we also do support the idea that land owned and managed by the water bureau should have the ability to provide secondary benefits for the community and environment when it is compatible. And we believe. The Water Bureau currently has that authority, but we also agree with and support Commissioner Fritz's decision to pull the referral at this time. And we are committed to continuing to engage in that conversation for the bolster it so we can bring it to the community and to the future. So as we've heard today, the Bull Run Watershed is one of the natural resource gems of the City of Portland. The Water Bureau has been a great steward of that land in recent memory, and current city code gives it strong protections, but it deserves the more lasting protections for future generations. These protections not only protect water quality, which is so important to our way of life, but also provides... undisturbed refuge for fish and for wildlife, which is critically important, especially as a region feels the pressure of climate change. In addition to the bull run protections, we also support referring the Authorization of mutual aid agreements to city charter. This is the essential component for planning, for responding to natural disasters, and for increasing the city's own resilience in the face of a disaster that we feel. Portland Audubon is wholeheartedly in support of moving these protections and mutual aid agreements to the city charter and we're excited about engaging our membership and the broader community in educating and bringing them along to vote for it in November so we appreciate your leadership thank you all for being here I really appreciate it that concludes our presentation thank you Keele is there a new testimony yes we had separate sign up sheets it's just testifying on all three of them together yeah okay In that case, we had three people sign up. Maggie, D. White, and Floyd Jones. All right, everyone, please come up if your name was called. You have three minutes. Please keep your testimony relevant to one of the three items and state your name for the record. Welcome. Maggie, your name is Quilfest. So there was... The senators were on C-SPAN yesterday talking about the amount of heat that is stored in our oceans and our streams and our rivers. And it's the amount of four Hiroshima-style bombs every second of every hour of every day being stored in our water. That means that as global temperatures go up, as they will continue to do because of CO2 emissions, those waters are going to get warmer and warmer, and those fish are going to get smaller and smaller. And, you know, it shouldn't take 44 years to protect water, to protect land. to preserve habitat for wildlife shouldn't take 44 years. That's all I have to say. Thank you. Hello, my name is Dee White. I'd like to comment on the First Amendment on protecting bull run. This is an important and excellent addition to the city charter. Thank you, Commissioner Fritz. There are stakeholders which oversight for writing this amendment, including the Public Utility Board or the Pub and Audubon, physicians, BARC. This is really good. This protects, hopefully, Bull Run and the rest of the system from privatization from the likes of CH2M Hill, Nestle, Carollo, and on and on, who would all love to have even a tiny piece of this precious asset that the citizens of Portland own and take great pride in. On the other hand, these other two amendments to the Charter, and I've got my testimony written, the other two amendments to the Charter are bad, bad, bad. These are two of the many bad deals that Randy Leonard put together when he was in office that were declared illegal in 2017 by the court in a lawsuit brought by law ratepayers. The judge found that ratepayer money was being spent on stuff that has nothing to do with water and sewer service that we pay for. Whose idea was this? Commissioner Fritz, these are not housekeeping items, as you said in your blog. These are proposed laws that y'all want to get on the city charter that nullifies the court order. You clearly are not interested in being transparent with the public who will be paying for disasters outside of Portland. Why should Portland ratepayers pay for a hurricane? Ratepayer money should not be used to expand this program of maintaining and building parks, community gardens, green spaces. No. Add a block on the water bill for contributions. Do not make us pay for this. A single mom out in East Portland can't afford this and should not be responsible for paying something that doesn't have anything to do with water. Both of these proposed amendments are about land and money, two things the Council has control over. These amendments, these second two, had no oversight, no stakeholders involved, and oversight for the Water Bureau and the BES right now is seriously broken. Last week, half of the pub resigned, including the two co-chair. And because the city has stacked the board with city employees, therefore implying perceived bias and conflict of interest. So, no, these two amendments should not be brought to the charter. Please vote no on both of these. But the bull run protections is excellent. Thank you. Floyd Jones. I'm with Friends of the Reservoirs. And as you know, we've been bull run water system advocates for a very long time, working diligently for over 17 years. You know, thanks to our forefathers, our Portland's Bull Run water system was perfectly designed to provide safe, low-cost drinking water, a federally protected watershed that restricts human and domestic animal entry, minimally treated pure water, and beautiful and utilitarian open reservoirs that vent disinfection byproducts and toxic radon found in the wellfield. Unfortunately, thanks to votes at council and high costs, 450 million eliminated the open reservoirs. Now we're going to spend 400 million to add a chemical adding filtration plant. We support, obviously, the Charter Amendment for watershed protections for our federally protected Bull Run watershed, particularly in light of the land exchange with the Forest Service. The water barrel was complicit in the illegal logging in Bull Run years ago, and we hope that this amendment to the Charter, you know, serves to protect forever our watershed. The other amendments we do not support, and the Rate Peer Advocacy Group, Water Accountability, Trust and Reform, and Judge Bouchon did not say that you could not enter into agreements with other agencies for disasters. It just said that you could not use restricted water funds. Do you want the Water Bureau traveling to California and all over the country and spending rate payer money? Middle class rate payers now cannot pay their water bills. And you've projected an increase of 7% per year for the next decade to pay for this project. you know, this filtration plant. You voted for the most expensive plant to address the non-infectious, harmless cryptosporidium that's been in the watershed since the beginning. We've always had that there. There is no problem, but yet we're spending the most that one could possibly spend to address a problem that doesn't exist. And I'm glad to see that you've pulled the other I mean, why would we want to continue to spend money on remodeling buildings like the Rose Festival Building, spending a million dollars to build a house up at Pal Butte for a Water Bureau employee to live and manage the park? You know, a Dodge Park renovation where water bureaus go and party. And we happened upon that by accident two years ago. Went out there and the buses were all coming and the water bureau was having a big party there. And they're going to have another party here in July. So we don't support those amendments. And we really think you need to be transparent about the pub resignations. Thank you. Thanks. Keelan, can you call the next people? Good morning. My name is Joe Walsh. Just a moment. Can I represent the individuals with justice? Just a moment, Mr. Walsh. Keelan, can you please call the next people? I'm not taking a vote. Mr. Walsh, can you cut his mic, please? And I am going to speak. I am following procedure and having you asked up to the table. You are now disrupting and I will ask you to leave. Mr. Walsh, you are disrupting and you will leave now. I'm calling a recess. You're going to point out... Before we begin, I would just like to note to everyone in chambers and anyone watching that we follow a certain protocol at council, and that is our clerk calls people up who have signed up to give testimony. And that's what I was attempting to do. I was not preventing Mr. Walsh from testifying. He had actually signed up. We simply needed to read his name into the record. And if people cannot respect our protocol, they can go express themselves somewhere else. Did anybody else sign up? Keelan, was there anyone else on the list for public testimony? No, just those three individuals signed up. Colleagues, is there any further discussion? So we're going to take up the resolution of 625? Yes. All right. Keelan, please. Yes. Call, this is a resolution. Please call the roll on the first item, item 625. Fish. Well, first, Commissioner Fritz, thank you for bringing this resolution forward. It obviously enjoys broad support in the community. It is well-crafted and thoughtful, and I enthusiastically support it. Aye. Fritz. Thank you to everybody who came today, to everybody who's participated in the discussion. We've had the discussion draft open for a month or so now, and I appreciate all the staff and community members who have provided me with information to inform this decision-making. Regarding the timing of these measures, as was mentioned under the land exchange, we first started discussing it when there was concern about the land exchange potentially reducing the protections for the Bull Run Watershed. And so that's one reason as to why now. Another reason is because the Metro Greenspaces Bond Measure in the fall makes a natural partnership for – our community support us. This is not only a low budget campaign, this is a no budget campaign. It will involve me doing a lot of going around the city talking to weddings, parties, anybody who will listen to me talking about the Bull Run Watershed and why we should protect it. It's a little bit strange to me that I don't know if I'm... I'm certainly one of the members of the council who most hates campaigning. And so now, in addition to the six campaigns that I've done for my own election, this will be my third ballot measure set that I have brought after the gas tax and the cannabis tax. So this will, you can, Portland, you can consider this a lovely parting gift, although I will not be parting until the end of next year. As I mentioned to Janice Thompson, I don't think I have it in me to do yet another campaign next year, but... Who knows, I might get now last wind and sprint to the finish. My Chief of Staff, Tim Crail, is looking very pale over there. I think we'll have to talk about that later. So the intent of these resolutions is to ask voters to show that they value our drinking water resources and emergency preparedness. As a public servant, I want to leave our water system better off. our community more resilient and allow our voters to participate in that decision. And the earthquake mutual aid thing is important. We need partners outside of Oregon to be able to help us out in the event of the big one.

Mutual aid is a beautiful thing and given the fact that natural disasters and climate change don't recognize jurisdictional boundaries, I don't think we should limit our service. I vote aye. And I would like to pull 627 back to my office please Madam President. All right. Sorry, the resolution is adopted. Sorry. 627 is being pulled back to Commissioner Fritz's office. Let's see where we are. 1056. I think we're on item 628. Keelan, can you please call the item? Appoint Courtney Sylvan-Fresher to the Citizen Review Committee and Advisory Board to the Auditor's Independent Police Review and the Police Bureau's Internal Affairs. All right. Is the auditor here or? Oh, okay. I'll just hand it off to staff. Good morning, commissioners. On behalf of the city auditor, my name is Amanda Lamb and I'm currently serving as the interim director of the Independent Police Review. I'm here to present to you Sylvan Frazier as an applicant for a three-year term on the Citizen Review Committee. As you know, the CRC plays a critical role in our civilian oversight system. The community members that volunteer on the CRC hear misconduct cases through the appeal function and also provide policy recommendations to the city council, the police commissioner and bureau, and the city auditor's office. Recruiting volunteers is a big undertaking, one undertaken by our Senior Outreach Coordinator Irene Konev, who is also here with me today. These volunteers carry a lot of responsibility, not only for the aforementioned tasks that I mentioned, but they also have to bring to the process fair and good judgment, a strong background in analysis and applying that analysis to decision making. And we also seek to have a volunteer base that is representative of our community. And though that's always a work in progress, we have made progress on that front. And I think our current applicant sitting here today is also reflective of that process. Sylvan Fraser brings with them a lot of work with vulnerable, marginalized, and often underrepresented communities. Their work with intersex individuals in the intersex community, as well as children and families in vulnerable situations, is a voice that is really imperative to have in the civilian oversight system. And we look forward to bringing them on board. I would also like to invite them to make any statement. Hi, good morning. My name is Sylvan. I'm honored to be under consideration for a position that would allow me to participate in the police accountability process as a representative of my community. If this trust is vested in me, I will review the matters that come before the committee to ensure fair and just outcomes. If my appointment pleases the city council, I look forward to the opportunity to serve. Thank you. Great. This is a resolution. So, Keelan, is there any testimony? One person signed up. Dan Handelman. Mr. Handelman. Welcome. As you know, you have three minutes. I know you'll keep it relevant because you always do. And please state your name for the record. Thank you, President Udaly. I'm Dan Handelman with Portland Cop Watch. Sounds like same kind of testimony I give often at these appointments. We don't have any issues with the applicant today. In fact, they seem to be the kind of person that Portland Copwatch has supported repeatedly. Somebody who knows both people who have been harmed by police and the police themselves. Such a perspective is much preferred to those who unquestionably support the police. Or even, and this may surprise some people, those who always assume the police are wrong. And you know all this about their background because you have the application as part of your packet today. You've read that per the ordinance. I want to talk about the CRC's present and future. As noted before, CRC has new members over the age of 50, which does not represent the population, is not changing today. The CRC's work groups are not meeting regularly in part due to other obligations by the members. Outreach, audits of complaints, and policy issues. on force and crowd control are being strung along with no progress or outcomes, even as the PPB has been involved in nine deadly force incidents in the last nine months and continues to get away with violent suppression of protests. I want to note the historic vote by Council last month, the first time the majority has voted to find misconduct in the 18 years the IPR system has been in place. Council was given final say because Chiefs Moose and Croker ignored council findings a total of three times under the old system. It was disheartening to hear the Mayor complain about the system structure when he was on the losing end of a vote. The auditor had a work group look at the IPRC-RC structure years ago, just two years ago actually, and not all the suggestions that were raised have been addressed. So before anybody tries doing a complete overhaul, perhaps we can look at the work that's already been done around this. There are also issues that were raised, have been raised repeatedly around IPR's limitations and CRC's limitations under the PPA contract. As you once again add a new member to this group, notably replacing Albert Lee partway into his term, please continue to focus on ways to support and strengthen the CRC and the IPR. One of the questions that I've raised a couple of times is why when somebody's replacing somebody midterm, are they given a full three-year term instead of having filling finishing that term because now the IPR has to stagger their filling the new seats instead of replacing everybody on regular cycles. And lastly just in terms of that case that you all heard last month the Commissioner Fish you were absent but the officer's discipline is going to be considered at the police reward but the Chief assured us that the police reward is not going to be able to overturn your finding which is very important in terms of the structure. Thank you. Colleagues any further discussion? This is a resolution. Keelan, please call the roll. Fish. Well, thank you for your willingness to step up and serve. Prince. This is a very difficult job, and I appreciate your willingness to do it. Aye. New Daily. Thank you, Sylvan. You bring an incredible background and personal experience and expertise. I'm really excited to see your work. I vote aye. The resolution is adopted. Keelan, please read item 629. Appoint Kaliska Day, Gabriela Saldana-Lopez, Karen Spencer, Karen Williams, and Mia Sabanovich as voting members, and Ana Brophy, Brian Laurent, and Sarah Petrosin as ex-officio members of the Portland Utility Board. Commissioner Fritz. Commissioner Fritz. Thank you, President Udeli and colleagues. Commissioner Fish and I are thrilled to have these appointments before us today. In partnership with the City Budget Office staff, the Portland Utility Board members, and our staff, we were very intentional about the outreach and recruitment process, which Archon Astor is going to describe to us in detail. We all shared the values and goals of increasing the diversity of the board in both expertise and lived experiences. This resulted in a strong pool of candidates and ultimately the finalists reflect our values. And I know that Commissioner Fish supports these and just asked me to pass it over to Amy Archermasters to talk more about it. Great, thank you. Good morning President, Commissioners. My name is Amy Archer-Masters. I'm currently the Portland Utility Board Analyst. I'm pleased to share just some brief information and am available to answer any questions regarding the recent recruitment for the Board and the appointments considering here today. Although the recruitment happens year-round, focused efforts began earlier this year, and we engaged with the offices of Civic Life, Government Relations, Council Offices, the Bureau of Environmental Services, the Portland Water Bureau, as well as community partners to conduct outreach, both through social media and campaigns. We received 13 applications for the current openings, and before you are the top five candidates for appointment. There would remain one vacancy due to the recent early resignation. A recruitment subcommittee was formed to review candidates and make recommendations. The subcommittee included members from the current Portland Utility Board, the Bureau of Environmental Services and Water Equity and Management representatives, commissioners, staff, and community member. The recruitment subcommittee identified the top five candidates for appointment before you today, although at the time only four positions were open during those interviews. The board subsequently recommended the four community member appointments and had some concerns about public perception issues that could arise by appointing additional city staff representatives. The subcommittee, however, felt that the community connections, skills, and experience of that staff representative would be an asset to the board. The board does plan to discuss board composition and determine whether any changes to code or bylaws are recommended in order to clarify that for any future recruitments. There was particular interest from the board as well as the subcommittee in expanding skills for engagement with diverse communities including tribal representatives, people of color, low income, youth and other under engaged or vulnerable communities. The appointments before you today do expand the skills of the board as desired and also include candidates with civic engagement, construction management, hydrogeology and watershed planning, civil engineering and legal experience. regarding the potential appointees are provided in the report document, and I'm happy to answer any questions that you may have. Amy, it was referenced earlier that, you know, why are there so many vacancies on the Portland Utility Board? Yeah, absolutely. So the appointments for the board are staggered. It's an 11-member voting and three ex officios. Every year, the ex officios are... appointed for one-year terms. For the 11 voting members, they're staggered so that every year there's at least three or four vacancies so that you have a constant turnover of some stability on the board as well as some new perspectives. So when we started the recruitment, we already had four positions that we were recruiting for. And it was just this past month that two additional, the two co-chairs resigned early. So we now have additional opening. So the four that we started the recruitment for because the term had already ended? Yes. Yes, or somebody had resigned in the prior year as well. So there were three full three-year appointments that were to be made this year, one that is a shorter term because the person who left last year had a shorter term remaining. And the question that some people have raised about – person who's a city employee being appointed as a community member. Is there anything in the bylaws or was there anything in our recruitment now that said that city employees could not apply? No, there's no conflict of city employees being appointed to the board. There are, of the 11 voting members, there is one that is specifically designated to be city staff and labor representative and so that appointment or that position is currently filled and and for the remainder it's open. The requirements in the bylaws do address the range of skills and experience that folks have in order to participate in the board so that we're trying to get a good balance of perspectives and that's really what the subcommittee considered. And there was conversation in the subcommittee about the fact that one of the candidates was a CFO city staff, but the community connections and skills and experience that that person brought forward, the subcommittee felt strong about and felt that she was a good candidate. And I believe that the report may be an error that that person is listed under. Yes. Ex officio rather than. Yeah, my apologies for that. On the first page is correct. The terms and the voting member appointment. Mia Sabanovic is the one that is a city staffer. She has worked at both Water Bureau and is currently employed at BES. In the bio section, I inadvertently pasted her in. under Anna Brophy, who is one of the ex-officio members. So it should have been in the initial section. So all of the information that's provided is correct, and the terms and who they're replacing is correct, but it was placed in the wrong place. portion of the form. It actually works out fairly well because it draws attention to her bio. She's being appointed to one of the shorter terms, so we wanted to do that intentionally, but it's really interesting to have a refugee from Bosnia-Herzegovina who really understands the importance of clean water and functioning wastewater systems from a lived experience of severe oppression and genocide. And and that she's very sensitive to the cultural and community diversities and participated in leadership development conference for women through the Muslim Educational Trust Centre. So she certainly brings a perspective which is very different from the standard city employee, although I would have to say that our 6,000 city employees often serve because they are public-spirited people who do a lot of good in the community. And so in discussions, Commissioner Fish and I felt that that should not disqualify her from wanting to volunteer her time. And just to be clear, she will not be getting paid city time to participate, unlike the ex-officio members. She will be volunteering her time. Well, I move the report. Second. Great. You beat me to it. Thank you. The report has been moved by Commissioner Fish and seconded by Commissioner Fritz. Keelan, please call the roll. Fish. Well it's an outstanding group of people willing to step up and serve at the pub. The pub and the cub play a vital role in enhancing transparency and community accountability. I want to thank everybody that has agreed to serve and we look forward to working with them for many years to come. Aye. Friends. In all of the community advisory bodies that I've been connected with I've tried to stress the importance of collaboration between community members and city staff and When just one or just the other does these recruitments and appointments, we tend to just talk to the people we know and not necessarily do a border outreach at the beginning of this recruitment. I was concerned that we didn't have enough applicants and I appreciate Amy Archimastis and Cynthia Diaz-Calvo, as well as Christina Nieves and in fact my entire staff team in reaching out to people to explain why would you want to serve on the Portland Utility Board because it's not something that I think many people either know about or certainly feel like they are capable of serving on. I do remember County Commissioner Judy Shiprack telling the story of how she was appointed to the state plumbing board. Not that she knew anything about plumbing, but she is a user. And I thought that that was a really good perspective to remind us that people who do their homework, who willing to put in the time to learn the issues and to give thoughtful advice, particularly if they have community connections who, and can give that perspective, can really help us in advising us on bodies like the Portland Utility Board. So I'm thrilled with the expertise in the BIOS for these appointments and I'm very happy to support them. Aye. New Daily. I vote aye. The report is accepted. Keelan, please read item 630. Amend Acquisition. Public art code to expand eligible uses of the 2% funds explicitly prioritize underserved communities and clarify city accountability. Madam President? Yes, Commissioner Fish. It's my intention, if there's no objection from the council, to take this back to my office and to file this. a substitute in two weeks, which incorporates some excellent feedback that we've received from the Regional Arts and Culture Council and others. So I would ask for unanimous consent to take this back to my office, and it is our intention, because we don't have council next week, that in two weeks we would file a substitute. Sounds good. Item 630 is being referred back to Commissioner Fish's office. Keelan, please read item 631. Okay. Appoint Chandra Robinson, reassign and reappoint Gary Don Ballester to the Portland Design Commission. This is the mayor's item. Are there staff here to present? Yes, welcome. Hello. You look familiar. Council members, it's good to see you again. My name is Tim Herron. I'm a senior planner with the Bureau of Development Services. President Udeli, it's nice to see you again. Commissioner Fritz, if you do run again... And Commissioner Fish always. My pleasure. It is also my pleasure to be before you to make a recommendation of appointment of Shonda Robertson to the vacant position of architect on the Portland Design Commission. And reappoint Commissioner Don Ballester to the position of developer. Commissioner Don, as we refer to him, as continuation to the second term of the design commission comes at a critical time. Given his expertise, particularly in construction and material technologies. He also has experience through his firm with the land use process and over the past couple years have come very quickly aligned with commission expectations to design guidelines, concerns of the neighbors, and has yielded high quality urban design proposals needing often only one hearing to be approved. This type of leadership by example is a helpful perspective to maintain on the design commission. And impress upon future customers of the land use process to work with the commission to complete projects faster, better, and minimize the number of hearings while yielding high quality compatible designs. And to my left, Chandra Robertson is a particularly unique candidate for the design commission by virtue of her global architectural experience. her native roots and her architectural practice here in Portland since 2005. Shonda's worked with Architects Without Borders for nearly 10 years, assisting communities that are in need in Tanzania, Haiti, and Nepal. And in Portland, while working for a local architectural firm, she collaborated on a community charrette for Right to Root, working with members of the Emanuel Temple to help envision what is missing in their community and what to add in order to help bring the community together. So for these reasons, Schander is an exceptional candidate and will be a particularly good fit for the architect position of the design commission. Thank you, Tim. I'm really excited to be here and excited about the opportunity to serve Portland and beyond Design Commission. I grew up here in Portland, like Tim said, and I for a long time saw that it was the same for a long time and I still loved it, but once it started changing, it still seemed like home to me and I really appreciated that and I think that's at least partly due to the Design Commission. And I really am excited to be a part of that, to watch Portland grow and to keep it Portland. Please state your name for the record. Sorry. My name is Chandra Robinson. Thank you. Colleagues? Thank you very much for your willingness to serve. Tim, I just have a technical question for you. I noticed that Ms. Robinson is able to be the architect position because Don Ballester is moving from the architect position to a developer position. Do we still have just two architects on the design commission? Correct. Thank you. Thank you. I move the report. Second. Fantastic. The report has been moved by Commissioner Fish and seconded by Commissioner Fritz. Kaelin, please close the roll. Fish. Well, Ms. Robinson, thank you very much for your willingness to serve. Ten years ago, there was a lot of controversy surrounding the design commission, and we had some very spirited hearings. Our last couple of hearings, we had a tremendous number of stakeholders come in and offer testimonials that the process is working very well towards the goal of higher levels of design. And that the decision making process is moving quickly and that a number of reforms have been implemented. So I think you are joining a high performing body. with strong leadership in Julie Livingston, who's here. And we thank you for agreeing to serve your community. Aye.
 Fritz.
 Thank you for the lots and lots of hours that this is going to take. I really appreciate you mentioning both your connection to Port and your long-time lived experience here. I was in the Good in the Hood parade on Saturday, and I walked down Williams Street, and I was somewhat shocked by the changes there. And so I'm going to really appreciate your... historical perspective to make sure that, as you said, that as we change, we still stay like Portland and that we look out for all communities. So thank you very much for your willingness to step up. Aye. New Daily. Well, thank you for your service. I'm really excited about the kind of perspective and expertise you're bringing. BDS is no longer my portfolio, so I don't get the chance to talk to many people over there anymore, but I really hope we cross paths because I'd love to know more about, especially architects without borders. I vote aye. The report is accepted. Kaylin, please read item 632. Thank you. Authorize a borrowing of not more than $52,900,000 in anticipation of the Fire and Police Disability and Retirement Fund levy for fiscal year 2019-20. Thank you. This is the Mayor's item, and we have staff here to present. Welcome. Good morning. Morning. I am Matt Geerak, the Debt Manager in the Bureau of Revenue and Financial Services. Good morning. I am Stacey Jones, the Pension and Finance Manager at FPDR. Thanks. So the ordinance being presented to you authorizes the city to issue up to $52.9 million of tax anticipation notes to finance the projected annual fiscal year 19-20 cash flow deficit in the Fire and Police Retirement Fund. Under Chapter 5 of the city charter, the city's fire and police retirement fund is funded annually through the FPVNR property tax levy, based on the amounts needed to pay and discharge all requirements of the fund for that year. You may recall that the FPVNR levy is separate from the city's general government levy and other levies. The vast majority of FP&R levy collections are received in mid-November of each year, resulting in insufficient fund balance during the July through October timeframe. Annually, the city utilizes tax anticipation notes, referred to as TANs, to provide interim funding during that period. The tax anticipation notes are short-term debt instruments that typically mature within one year of issuance. The city's debt management division will be facilitating the sale of the 2019 TANs in late July with a scheduled closing in August. The 2019 TANs will subsequently mature in June of 2020. Based on today's capital markets conditions, our estimated borrowing rate is approximately 1.5%, though this will vary depending on market events that occur between now and the TANs sale when the rate is locked. So if you have any questions, please let us know. Colleagues? No? All right. Keelan, is there any testimony on this item? One person signed up, Maggie. Great. Thank you for being here. Is Maggie here? All right. I see no further discussion. This is a first reading of a non-emergency item. It moves to second reading. Thank you. Keelan, please read item 633. Assess property for sidewalk repair for the Portland Bureau of Transportation. All right. This is my item. This is a second reading. Any further discussion? No. All right. Keelan, please call the roll. Fish. And just to be clear, these are all the sidewalk repairs for which there were no remonstrances. So there's no controversy. Aye. Fritz. Aye. New Daily. Well, we heard some concerns brought up by a community member about our sidewalk repair system and process. And I want to assure everyone that we're looking into these issues. to make sure that we have a appropriate, accurate, and accessible process for community members to follow when they do want to appeal a decision. I vote aye. The ordinance is adopted. Keelan, please read item 634. And underground wiring districts code to permit the attachment of wireless facilities on poles. Current city code does not allow for attachments in the right-of-way and underground wiring districts. This code change would create an exemption to allow wireless attachments to poles in these areas, and it is my understanding that we are legally obligated to do so. PBOT staff, Anne Hill, as well as Tim Herron from BDS, are here to explain and answer any questions. Welcome. Welcome. Thank you very much. President Udeli and the rest of City Council. This morning I have a short presentation followed by invited testimony from BDS staff, Tim Herron, who's joined me here today. Oh, and I should add that I'm going to be introducing a substitute ordinance with some minor changes, which staff will also be explaining in their presentation. And I need to ask for a motion to accept the substitute. So moved. Second. Great. The substitute has been moved by Commissioner Fish and seconded by Commissioner Fritz. Please proceed. Thank you. I will briefly review small cell wireless facilities, their impact on city-owned poles, the need for the code update, and future next steps. I will then turn it over to Tim. So as I'm sure by now you are all aware, cellular and wireless providers are currently expanding their networks of small cells throughout urban areas to improve coverage and increase cellular network capacity. to meet the increasing demand on their current network served by cell towers. It's anticipated that there could be as many as 2,400 wireless small cell facilities throughout the entire city of Portland. While most of those attachments will be attached to utility poles or third-party poles in the right-of-way, many will be attached to city-owned poles such as streetlights. So what this city code update does is two things. The first thing it does is it actually adds TriMet as an identified asset owner. So the code up to this point has really only talked about utility pole owners because they're the ones that had attachments, their own attachments in the right-of-way. By providing a definition for TriMet because they have cantonary poles, they own different pieces of infrastructure in the right-of-way throughout the city, this will allow them to be considered a third-party pole owner just like TriMet. the electrical utilities. The second step is the code we've amended the code to allow for wireless attachments on infrastructure in the right-of-way in underground wiring districts and the reason that this is important is because in our downtown which is largely an underground wiring district, the only poles are our ornamental streetlight poles predominantly and signal lights. That's because all of the electrical wires are underground, so we don't have poles. Excuse me one sec. We keep losing the power point. Oh, sorry. It goes on and off. Keep scanning for signal. It's back up, Carla. Oh, now it's gone. Oh. Thank you. Oh, oh. Someone closed a door and it's back down again. How many slides do you have on your PowerPoint? Not many more. I think the only one that would be is just for you to see where the underground wiring districts are. But I think you have some of that in your packets as well. So I can just read. I don't have very much more to... It's basically downtown where the underlying districts are. There actually are six underground wiring districts, but they are literally... like Grant Avenue or Martin Luther King Avenue. They're literally one street, and they're only small portions of those streets. The largest area is here in the downtown, and when we realized, staff, that there were going to be no opportunities for industry to attach, which could be a barrier to entry, the first thing I did was call Tim and say, I think we need to start some conversations with the historic... design landmarks commission and the design commission just around what this could mean in the future. So we did go meet with, I'm now since I don't have slides, in March 2019 we did go back, return back to the historic both commissions actually were meeting together at a joint session and we had completed an inventory of all streetlight poles in the downtown corridor so basically the 405 to the river and we identified every single streetlight that was not an ornamental pole. So we have about 500 of those that we can those are what we call the cobalt heads they're just sort of those aluminum standard street lights. So we can offer those up initially to the industry to attach while we figure out what the next steps are if that's not going to be enough coverage. And so what the commission suggested was for us to go through a design and RFI process to actually get designs and see if we could come up with an iconic design for Portland. They weren't interested in a fake ornamental. They wanted to see if we could design something new. And this has become also important as we look at South Waterfront that we need to stop probably designing infrastructure in the right of way that's only single use, like a street light. So it was a good exercise for us to go through. So we've had a kickoff meeting. Yay! And Tim's going to talk a little bit about that as well. We're doing this in partnership with BDS. And we also did invite parks, understanding that there's a lot of streetlights and parks and infrastructure and just so that they can be part of this process. We've committed to come back here to council in the summer of 2020 with whatever that proposal streetlight design is, just so that you can stay up to speed and provide. provide any comments or direction as well. And in the meantime they can or cannot put things on light poles? They can, they'll be able to attach to the straight light poles that aren't ornamental. The ornamental straight lights like physically will not hold them. So we will not be removing or replacing those. That will not happen until we come to council and there's you know a discussion and a public hearing. People understand what and how and why that would happen. Thank you. In terms of outreach for the Underground, this code update, I just did want to follow up. So we did actually two separate rounds of outreach. We did a public notice for the initial code change that was posted in the March 22nd edition of the Daily Journal of Commerce. And then we update that you see before you today was published in the May 28th edition of the Daily Journal of Commerce. We additionally posted it on the web page at PBOT, and we notified every neighborhood association, even if it was one street. District coalition, local business associations, including TriMet, Portland Mall Management, Inc., and the industry partners. Additionally, we briefed, as I said, the design and historic commissions. So with that... I am done with my portion of the presentation. My apologies. I'm happy to send around, or maybe we can send around the PowerPoint. And I want to turn it over to Tim before we answer any questions. Well, mine really needs the pictures. Is it going to work? We can try it again. We've called someone. You want to swap? Yeah, let's swap. Thanks. Again, my name is Tim Herron. I'm Bureau of Development Services Senior Planner and Director design commission liaison and sitting in for Hillary Adam who's a historical landmarks commission liaison and I'm also sitting in for uh commissioner Brian McCarter design commissioner Brian McCarter who's out of town this week he otherwise would have gave this presentation so I'm here to do that um and by extension um I'm also sitting in for commissioner Maya Foti historic landmarks commission vice chair who was also out and this was really I have more pictures than words, because it's part of what I do. It's up right now. It's kind of flashing in and out. Okay. Well, I think what I'll do is I'm happy to forward to you all a PowerPoint with the notes included. Would it be helpful for me to talk a little bit about the process? Sure. Yes, I think we should just, my own preference is to keep the camera on you, Tim, so we can listen to you. It's very disruptive to have this thing come in and out. Okay. This is a first reading of an ordinance. Commissioner Fritz? If you could just post the presentation on your website, I think it's important for the community to be able to see it. Yeah, well, that's kind of why I'm bumming. I don't know if this is going to be helpful to do for you all, is to hold up a picture. Okay. Oh, here. Oh, thank you. Yeah. Tim, the two things that I'm hoping you'll cover or one of you will cover are what are the minor amendments and also talking about, I think this is another instance where we're trying to get out ahead of something that can be forced on us. Fantastic. And we're trying to get out ahead of something that can be forced on us. So we're trying to ensure the best outcome for the city, even if this is not the most desirable outcome for us. That's fine. Basically, I would have otherwise had nine slides. Okay. So let me just narrate those slides and paint a picture with my words. Yeah. You could do charades. Okay. I could try to be a, I do say that I'm as tall as a canister, a 4G cantina. So as I mentioned. What a posse pickup line that one is. I know, six feet tall, yes. So I work very closely with the Design Historic Landmarks Commission and work very closely with Anne Hill and PBOT. And well over almost two years ago, we started a conversation about how do we integrate these new RF facilities on what we call vertical infrastructure in the right-of-way. And we very quickly zeroed in on a very possessive ownership of the twin ornamentals, meaning they're ornamental the way they are. attaching or integrating or trying to find some other way to attach these additional facilities to them seemed problematic. We worked through different charrettes and various things and realized very quickly that part of the Design Commission, Historic Landmarks Commission's role is we spend a lot of time protecting the public realm and how the realm is organized. So when I say public realm, I think about things and everything related to the sidewalk. These being projecting signs into the right-of-way which are reviewed by staff or the commission, canopies projecting into the right-of-way, the alignment and coordination with PBOT on where the street trees are, where the street furniture is located, the scores in the concrete, the brick pavers in the sidewalk. These are all things through advice of commission when working with PBOT that we feel is important to provide advice and design that space. So no different should it be for small cell infrastructure in the right-of-way. So I'm on slide three. Commissioner Brian McCarter, who you all pointed to his first term back in December of last year, is his significant role with Zimmer Gunsel Fraschel and working through the TriMet bus line, in which runs up fifth and sixth, as you know, and we reorganized. there's a lot of street parts. There's canterry poles, there's ornamentals, there's ticket meters, there's a lot of furnishings that were very specifically and thoughtfully considered, co-located as best possible, so that that flow to and from that light rail alignment at these mid-blocks was as smooth as possible. This takes effort. We do design our streetscapes, and we work very closely with Peabody to do that. One of the slides we have was that, and as already mentioned, is through this effort we realized, well, we should have a real hard inventory of where the twin ornamentals are and then by virtue of where they are not. That was important because understanding the need for these facilities to come forward. into our environment, that we have some measures in place before the requests come, President Udalli. That's something that we are trying to get in front of, and I think we are very successfully. So, one thing we came up with was to establish a hierarchy on where these new locations may go vis-a-vis these small cells. Number one would be at street intersections on existing utility poles, meaning the street signals, I mean, we're in the downtown core, signalized intersections where they have more of a functional feel and flavor, they're painted gray, they fit that corner and that intersection, and that this would be the first choice. Number two was an avoidance of sensitive areas. And by sensitive areas, I'm speaking of historic districts, the North and South Park blocks, certain cultural areas, South Auditorium, the pedestrian malls, and other similar locations. And so those we mapped. And we said, okay, well, outside of these areas, let's work the problem and find where locations could be. As I mentioned, number three was what we kind of just prohibited infrastructure would be the twin ornamentals. We just felt like the ornamentals are right the way they are. Adding to them, manipulating them seemed to be problematic. The scenarios we looked at got harder and harder. And as I already mentioned, it's like, well, let's find these Cobra heads. Very simple, very utilitarian. These are ones we should be adding these facilities to. And there are tentative designs for that. We also had a conversation, and this is where a new stakeholder group has been put together, is maybe talking about how do we put together a new smart pole, so to speak. And when that pole would be something where it incorporates multiple elements. Anne alluded to this. One of the efforts that we did in South Waterfront was co-locate lights, co-locate street intersections, co-locate other features on one pole. Now, that in and of itself was worthy, had our – foresight been better, we probably would have been thinking about also integrating that kind of element. So one of the images I have and I'm sure you're familiar with South Waterfront is if you look around there's a lot of co-located equipment. Lights on intersections and poles to limit the amount of vertical things and sticks that run along that furnishing zone and that's something we're wanting to get in front of. I think we're looking at a 21st century city in terms of our access to any number of parts and things that show up in our furnishing zone. If we could co-locate this stuff, which also means heavier weight, stronger poles, a series of things, we're going to try and put on our best crystal ball forward thinking and have this RFI process, as we're calling it, where all these stakeholders involved, including representatives of the Design Commission and the Landmarks Commission and myself will... have another product and probably be back before you sometime in the future. Yeah. So that's my presentation. I hope I was colorful. So colorful. Thank you. Before we move on to public testimony, Keelan, I need you to call the roll on accepting the substitute. Fish? Aye. Fritz? Aye. New Daily? Aye. Thank you. The substitute is on the record now. Keelan, is there any testimony on this item? One person signed up, Steve Entwistle, Sr. Thank you. Welcome. You have three minutes. Please state your name for the record. Morning, Council. My name is Steve Entwistle, Sr. I have a little bit of a concern. Have you guys ever heard of EMF or EMP? Do you know what I'm talking about? Raise your hand. If not, I'll tell you. EMF is electronic fields, okay, electromagnetic fields, okay, that are You may have heard of the smart meter electronic problems that they're having that's causing cancer. Well, these 4G and these 5G instruments are creating problems for people, and people don't realize this, and they don't know how to protect themselves from it. There is protection available, but it's very expensive. You can protect your windows, you can protect your bedding, you can put a canopy over your bed. You can wear a hat at night so you can sleep. Some people have it harder than others with this EMF and EMP. Electromagnetic pollution, electromagnetic fields, they're everywhere. There's detectors and there's devices that you can test your areas and find out it's new. People don't know. The doctors don't know exactly what it's going to be causing and the long-term effects. But they are affecting people, and we are not being protected, okay? Especially people that live in URM buildings, okay? And I can go on with that, the earlier testimony. about the URM buildings, okay, the concrete pancakes that all the low-income people are going to have to face when that earthquake hits, okay, and then the clean water that goes into the dirty water pipes into those URM buildings. That needs to be discussed, too, as well. And there's another one, but we need to really be concerned, okay, about this issue with electromagnetic pollution that is being – just every day it gets more and more. And the most vulnerable people are the ones that are low-income folks. They can't afford to pay for all that protection, whereas some of you folks already have it and don't tell anybody. Thank you. Thank you. Colleagues, any further discussion? All right. This is the first reading of a non-emergency item. It moves to second reading. Thank you. Keelan, sorry, I called you Carla. Keelan, please read item 635. Amend contract with TriMet for $6,571,781 to provide for enhanced upkeep and security of the Portland Transit Mall and the original light rail transit loop segment of First Avenue, Morrison, and Yamhill Streets. Colleagues, this contract has been in place since the Portland Transit Mall became fully operational in 2009. It's an agreement we made with TriMet to ensure the success of public transportation in downtown Portland and to support its use by a wide range of riders. Catherine Levine, Streetcar Division Manager, is here to provide information and answer questions. Welcome, Catherine. Thank you. Just a... A brief background. When the mall was reconstructed and opened again in 2009, both agencies, City and TriMet, agreed to dedicate funding to ensure that the place... The transit law was well maintained, cleaned, and security services provided. So what's before you today is an ordinance that would be the third extension, third five-year extension of the agreement we have in place with TriMet. The total dollar amount is specified. That's over five years. I understand that there were questions about that, so I wanted to just briefly describe the funding. Okay. Basically, the Bureau puts over half a million dollars annually into a major maintenance account. That's an account here at the city, and its purpose is to ensure that when it comes time to repave the asphalt paving in the mall, that we have funds available to do so. In addition, we provide over $700,000 a year to TriMet. TriMet, in turn, adds its funding and contributions from private property owners and contracts with a nonprofit, Portland Mall Management, Inc. They exist to provide oversight on the mall and to ensure that the maintenance, cleaning, and security is completed each year. Their contract is approximately $1.8 million a year in total. And I know there was a question about security services. Security services represent about a third of that total contract. We're aware that within the Central East Side there is an exciting pilot program about to take place, Safety for All, which would have unarmed safety ambassadors providing security. We'd certainly like to look at how that is accomplished and whether we have an opportunity to apply that model here as well in the future. Thank you. Colleagues, I just want to add that we will be coming back with or will very likely be coming back with amendments around the security MOU when this item returns to council. Madam President, if I could also just note that during the budget process was a conversation about who's going to pick up the cost of the planter pots in and around the transit mall, whether that would continue to be a cost borne by Portland Parks and Rec or by someone else. We look forward to continuing to work with PBOT and TriMet to establish the right level of service and the right funding for this work. So thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Keelan, is there any testimony on this item? No. One person signed up, Steve Entwistle Sr. Welcome. Please state your name for the record. You have three minutes. I'm Steve Entwistle Sr. We have a little bit of a concern here. During social service facility closures, whether temporary, spontaneous, or permanent, homeless or houseless are forced to seek social services at other facilities. Yes. They need to ride the max to get there. Try met dragnets, homeless people looking for social services. Don't fund this. This is a trap. I think this is wrong. And I think anybody that knows that can see that. But this council seems to just, I don't know, it just seems kind of ignorant to me. But anyway, make it real short here. And what earlier today, what happened with Joe Walsh here in the corner here. You need to keep your testimony relevant to this item that is not relevant. President of the council, you daily. Chloe, you daily. This is about amending the contract for the transit mall. Keep it relevant or take your seat. Well, my relevancy, okay, is my presence here. Okay. No, that's not how this works. That's how I work. Well, I set the time. And I think what you did to Joe Walsh earlier today was stupid. You're disrupting. Your testimony is over. You need to return to your seat or you'll be removed. I don't care what you said. Well, good. Goodbye. Good day. Good night. Colleagues, any further discussion? This is the first reading of a non-emergency item. It moves to second reading. Keelan, please read item 636. Okay. Authorize a competitive solicitation and contract for the photographic traffic enforcement system and related services. This is a second reading. Any further discussion? Caitlin, please call the roll. Fish. Fritz. Aye. New Daily. Gosh, so many people left here to hear this very important item. It actually is an important item. Yes. Yes. Over the last five years, there has been an annual average of 38 traffic deaths in the city of Portland. Many deadly crashes happen because of dangerous behaviors such as speeding and other traffic law violations. We just had one last night on Lombard. Expanding photographic traffic enforcement is among the 32 identified actions in the Vision Zero action plan, which aims to eliminate all traffic deaths and serious injuries. I want to address a few issues or concerns that came up in the first reading. First of all, although we're expanding the number of cameras, The police bureau doesn't have the capacity to issue additional citations, so we will be flipping the switches, turning cameras off and on throughout the city. But there won't be additional citations issued until Traffic Enforcement Division has more officers who can review those citations. These cameras reduce speeding, they reduce running red lights, They eliminate bias or perceived bias by eliminating interaction between police officers and community members. They make our streets safer for both community members and police. There's no chasing involved. The camera takes a photo if an infraction is... Caps caught or if it's triggered by an infraction. So there's no chases through our streets. There's no police, vulnerable police officers standing next to a vehicle in heavy traffic. We've had officers hit. So while I understand concerns about over policing and low income communities and communities of color, I just want to assure my colleagues in the public that. This is actually a better alternative than adding people, adding motors on the ground. And that these are issues my office and my bureau take very seriously. And we will continue to work with community on addressing any concerns or disparate impacts. With that said, I want to share a little data with you about East Portland. Over half of the deadly crashes in our city occur on the high crash network, which represents just 8% of streets in Portland. Of the 30 high crash intersections, 29 are located in East Portland. East Portland also experiences twice the number of pedestrian fatalities per capita compared to the city overall. So while these cameras will be dispersed throughout the city, there's obviously a need for focus in East Portland. I believe it's my responsibility as Transportation Commissioner to protect East Portlanders as well as everyone else in the city and this is One way we are going to try to achieve that I'm gonna think P bot staff Especially Dana Dickman for all your work on this item. I vote aye The ordinance is adopted Please read item 637. I Authorize an intergovernmental agreement with Multnomah County Department of Community Justice in the amount of $206,000 to conduct general heavy brushing and cleanup work. This is a second reading. Is there any further discussion? Keelan, please call the roll. Fish. Fritz. Aye. New Daily. Aye. Thank you. The ordinance is adopted. And we are adjourned. We'll reconvene at 2 p.m. Good afternoon, everyone. This is the Portland City Council session for June 26, 2019. Carla, okay. Kaylin? Keelan. Keelan. I'm so sorry. I wrote your name down like 20 times trying to remember it earlier. I know so many K-A-L names. I'm sorry. Keelan. Please call the roll. Of course. Fish. Here. Hardesty. Here. Here. Fritz here, Wheeler, New Daily. I'm here halfway. Okay, thank you. Before, do we read the rules of decorum in the afternoon session too? Always, because otherwise how would we know? Will our city attorney please read the rules of decorum? As quick as possible.

Thank you. We will begin with our first time certain. Keelan, will you please read item 638. Authorize an intergovernmental agreement with Multnomah County for the Revenue Division of the Bureau of Revenue and Financial Services to administer the Multnomah County business income tax. Thank you. Welcome. Thank you. Jennifer Cooperman, Chief Financial Officer. I'm here for Thomas Lanham, who is homesick and I'm sure is watching this on video. So the item before us today is a one-year extension of the current city-county intergovernmental agreement for the city to collect the Multnomah County business income tax. The only significant change from the current five-year IGA is a 5% increase in compensation to the city. This new compensation level is $1.35 million. I should say that the current IGA expires on June 30th of 2019, which is why we are here for you with a one-year extension. And the county commission approved this IGA last week. The City Council's adopted budget for fiscal year 19-20 included two budget notes pertaining to city and county cost sharing around tax collection. The county should be paying more for the base service that we are providing to them, about $1.3 million more than they do now. And we also believe that they should be paying for its share of the new integrated tax system project. We, their share of the ITS project is estimated at about 1.9 million over 10 years and then drops to 1.3 million each year thereafter. So we are asking for a one year extension to the IGA to continue negotiating with the county for an increase in their cost sharing at the end of this one year agreement. Thank you. Sorry, got a little discombobulated here. Colleagues, any questions for Ms. Cooperman? No. Is there any testimony? No one signed up. All right. This is an emergency item, so Keelan, please call the roll. Fish. Hardesty. Aye. Fritz. Thank you for your very succinct and accurate information. Aye. Newdailey. Thank you for that. I vote aye. The ordinance is adopted. Let's move on to the consent agenda, please. First of all, have any items been pulled since the last time I asked you that question? Fantastic. Please call the roll on the consent agenda. Fish. Hardesty. Aye. Aye. New Daily. Aye. The consent agenda is approved. Keelan, can you please read item 641? Aye. Extend contract with Motivate International Inc. for the continued operation of the bike share system not to exceed $14,780,000. Biketown has become an important part of our transportation system and is helping us reach our goals to reduce congestion. carbon emissions and increase the availability of low cost forms of transportation. Here to explain the contract and its many benefits is PBOT staff Steve Hoyt-McBeth, the section manager for the active transportation and safety division. Steve, take it away. Thank you Commissioner Udalli and good afternoon commissioners. My name is Steve Hoyt-McBeth. I'm the program manager for the bike town, the city's bike share program. I'd like to provide some context for today's council item before I kind of go into the actual request itself. We are preparing to release an RFP this summer to expand Biketown to new neighborhoods. Hopefully that will include the entire city and to incorporate electric assist bicycles. We don't expect that that new system will be up and running until the spring of 2020, potentially with a new operator because the RFP hasn't been released yet so we don't know that. So the administrative actions that I'm requesting of you today allow Portlanders to have a continuous bike share service during this transition from our current system through to that new system. And to do that, we also need to increase the contract value of the contract. In March of this year, we had the pleasure of presenting to you with our community partners at Street Roots, Curb Bikes, who operates our Adaptive Biketown program, Our main sponsors, Nike and Kaiser Permanente. Our 2018 annual report, that was really a great opportunity for us to spend a lot of time in front of council with our larger program team. Let me, if I could, just give some high level summaries from that presentation and just about Biketown in general. Biketown is a city-owned program just like Portland Streetcar and Portland Tram. In 2018, both of our equity programs, Bike Town for All, which serves people living on low incomes, and Adaptive Bike Town, which is aimed at providing increased bicycle access to people with disabilities, doubled their ridership from the previous year. And Bike Town as a whole saw a 28% increase in ridership. And in 2019, our ridership numbers have actually continued to increase over those 2018 numbers. Bike Town is funded through a unique sort of contractual and financial arrangement where Motivate, our operator, is only paid for its operation of the system based on the revenue that comes into the system. Whether that be through user revenues from people who use the system or from our sponsorships which are primarily the Nike and Kaiser Permanente. So as I mentioned earlier, we're preparing to release an RFP this summer for a larger and more expanded bike share system that will reach more neighborhoods. And hopefully it will include electric assist bicycles. We're really excited about the electric assist bicycle piece of this because we think it's really going to make a difference, not only for people in general and making bike share and bicycling more attractive to more people, but from an equity perspective as we move the system out into East Portland and other areas, hopefully in Southwest as well with the hills, a little electric bike component will really make biking more attractive. more viable for people. Trips tend to be longer the further we get from the city center so that having that electric piece is more important and if there are hills involved obviously the electric piece helps as well. So as I mentioned before this ordinance helps create a smooth transition between the existing system that is operated under a current contract with Motivate and the new expanded electric bike system which will launch in spring of 2020. So Today I'm requesting approval for two actions within the one ordinance. One is to extend the term of our current contract with Motivate International until April 30th, 2020. The term is currently set to expire this August. And I think I've already said enough about extending the contract will help us provide that transition between the old current contract and our new contract. And the second requested action is to increase the contract value to 14.7 million. This would be an increase in 3.4 million from our current contract. If the council votes today, excuse me, to extend mortgage contract from the term, staff estimate that cost to be at 3.4 million. And the contract value here, just to make sure that I'm being clear, reflects the total that Motivate has paid through the whole length of that contract. So starting from 2013 when that contract was enacted by approval by council to its end date, which would, in this scenario of your approval, would be through April of 2020. And so just in terms of over the life of the contract, the three main costs of this contract in case you were wondering are the capital costs for us to launch that system, that was about $4 million. Sponsorship finder fees, so Motivate brokered both of our major sponsorship agreements with Nike and Kaiser Permanente, and as part of the agreement that we had established prior to those sponsorships, they receive a finder's fee on the payment that goes towards them. That's about $1.5 million that we pay to date, and then the largest piece of this is our monthly operation of the system. It's a monthly operation fee, which is tied to the number of bicycles that are in operation during that previous month of that invoice. And so, again, I just want to make sure that I'm clear that our contract explicitly limits payment to Motivate for Biketown operations to the private sponsorship revenues and the Biketown operations. And an affirmative vote by council today will not have an impact on the city budget passed by council. Thank you very much for your consideration today and for your past support of Biketown. Thank you. Colleagues, any questions? Commissioner Fritz? Thank you. Do we know if the sponsorships are going to continue? Thank you for the question, Commissioner Fritz. So I guess the honest answer is we don't. In terms of the term of those contracts, the Nike agreement goes through July of 2021. The Kaiser Permanente agreement is also a five-year agreement, but it began a year later. So actually, it sunsets almost positive in November of 2021. However, with the Nike agreement, we have a clause in that contract that says that that the year previous to the end of that contract, so next summer, we will present an offer to them about extending that agreement and then we have kind of a period of time in which we go into a, if they express an interest, we go into a kind of a period where we, you know, we don't negotiate with anyone else. So it's certainly our intent to try to extend that agreement in the way with the one that expires and also to have a different financial arrangement in terms of how that money would flow with our agreement. So as opposed to a new agreement, we're not going to broker that through a third party. We're going to intend to broker that ourselves so that we would receive, the money would go directly to the city as opposed to go through a finder's fee as it does currently. Which is more than you asked, but I'm sorry. No, no. I was about to ask some questions. I'll have a couple. Um... I momentarily lost them there. Commissioner Hose, did you want to take a turn? Thank you. I was not going to ask a question, but your question led me to my question. And my question has to do with what are the benefits of sponsorship to Biketown for these corporations who choose to do so? Thank you for that question Commissioner Hardesty. I think that you know some of it I can only say what both we propose as part of the value to them and also what I anticipate that that is. I think that on the barest kind of more from just a pure marketplace sort of piece of it is that it's a piece of real estate. I don't mean to start in the coldest terms possible, but it is often when the valuation process is done on sponsorships for whether it be a city asset such as bike share or a stadium naming rights. They look at kind of what the kind of ad value is of that piece. So I think a piece of that is just a place to show your brand and to show some messaging. We are – in Portland, we have – been more protective of our public assets in terms of advertising and sponsorship. So actually that has helped to increase the value of that in terms of what we have done with Biketown. For Nike, I can tell you what they have expressed to us and that they feel and what they have presented when they were here in March was that they feel that, you know, Portland is part of their community and part of their neighborhood. They refer within the foundation that funds... bike town as the backyard project. So it's really this sense of like, we live here, we work here. You know, there's over 5,000 Nike employees who live in the city of Portland. So there's a real tie there with them. For Kaiser Permanente, I'm sorry, I'll try to be short. Kaiser Permanente, they have an existing facility. kind of marketing focus, which I think also kind of circulates back to their values of physical activity and trying to look at that in a way that's less clinical, but more about how you integrate health into people's everyday life. So the Biketown sponsorship, I think, was an extension of what they've done with Sunday Parkways, which is looking at ways to try to normalize health with people. Thank you. And one last follow-up question. And so under the new contract, because like right now, the Swish is on every Biketown bike. That's correct. And I don't remember if Kaiser Permanente has a logo on those bikes as well. They do not. Kaiser's sponsorship is expressed in terms of... visually through on 25 of the station panels. So you will see on the bottom quarter of the station panel, there's a Kaiser Permanente piece, and then we do a lot of marketing. But the bicycle has been a piece that we have held only with one sponsor, which is both... because of the strength of the sponsorship agreement, Nike really wanted to have the bike as their sole piece. And also there was a lot of concern both among our leadership, both at Peabody and at the city, that we didn't want the bikes to look like a NASCAR sort of bike. And so that was the... That was actually where I was headed. And so which means that the one logo that would be on there is worth a lot more than... would be if you had 20 logos on it. And so I hope in the renegotiations that we understand the power of our position and Yes. make sure that that's a beneficiary agreement. Thank you so much. Thank you very much, Commissioner. Sorry, I did remember my other questions. One of them is the city neither benefits nor loses financially with this program. Is that correct? That is correct. I'm sorry, just to make sure that you, it's not that we don't, I want to make sure that I'm answering your question completely correct. My time on this project is not covered through the sponsorship money. It's covered through GTR, but the actual, the operation, the money we pay Motivate, it's purely through those two sources, and we are insulated from a risk. So as per your direction and Commissioner Saltzman's and Commissioner Fisher's, when the original vote happened, If there's not enough money in this bike share revenue account that is on the slide, then Motivate is not paid beyond that amount. I appreciate the detail of your response that you're paid through gas tax revenue. You actually made me remember a third question because there was a lot of discussion about helmets. And I was concerned to see that one of the images showed somebody who did not appear to have a helmet. Have we made any progress on the whole helmet issue? No. Commissioner, you showed a demonstrated lot of leadership back in 2011 and required that we have as part of that an original contract, a provision that our contractor motivate would explore a helmet vending operation. So excuse me for this another long answer. But the short answer is we have not made progress on having a real time operation. something that's available in real time for somebody with a helmet, which I think is really the challenge with a shared mobility service. We pursued negotiations with a vendor that proposed to have a helmet vending solution. We We're looking to incorporate that into our kiosks that we have, and then that company went bankrupt. And we have yet to see anybody else enter the marketplace. I do think that this moment when we come back with a new RFP will be an opportunity to, again, look either through our bike share operators or through others to see if there is anyone else who comes to market or if there are other solutions out there. So thank you for that answer. Potentially, obviously the parade and Event season has started for the summer and I've noticed the scooter companies have been tabling and have been giving out helmets I wonder if there's an opportunity for some collaboration between Motivate and the scooter companies because they both face the same challenges and sooner or later somebody is going to get seriously injured By riding either a bike or a scooter without a helmet. So I just that's not a question It's more of a suggestion to see if they could collaborate together. And then my final question is related to scooters and the placements. You mentioned that we're expanding the bike stations to Southwest, potentially with some e-bikes. Hopefully that would include at the transit centers, or the transit center in Southwest. Yes. And I would hope, again, that there would be some collaboration so that there could be options for people who would rather scooter than e-bike. bike in Southwest and in other areas of the city where, which have previously not been served at all. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm really still looking for my silver scooter opportunity. Well, thank you, Steve. I want to take this chance to let anyone who might be listening or remind anyone who might be listening that unlike bikes, when you ride a scooter, you are required by law to wear a helmet. So if you're not wearing a helmet, you are breaking the law. It might seem arbitrary because you can certainly ride 15 miles an hour or faster on a bicycle, but our laws say if it's motorized and it's not an e-bike... You have to wear a helmet. All right. Keelan, any public testimony? No one signed up. This is an emergency item. Keelan, please call the roll. Fish. This has been a good discussion. Thank you for answering all the council questions that came up. I think we know where we stand. I'm pleased to support the ordinance. Excuse me, the contract. Aye. Hard to speak. I also want to add my thanks. I appreciate you making time to come by my office and answer my really hard questions. And I think that this is, we're moving in the right direction and I'm looking forward to having bicycles in East Portland, which is not something that we've had any opportunity to participate in. And so I am happy to vote aye. I'm struck with how different this is from when we first passed the ordinance. And congratulations for that. In this case, I think it's definitely a good thing that it's much less controversial and has become more of a way of life. Just as Commissioner Udier took the opportunity to remind people that riding with helmets is mandatory in some instances, we also want to remind people that riding bicycles on sidewalks downtown is not allowed and riding scooters on sidewalks anywhere is not allowed. And again, that seems very arbitrary, but that's the rule. So if people... they say this is the reason we can't have nice things. If people continue to break the rules, then there will be a problem and then they will no longer be able to have the nice thing of the bikes and scooters. And so I really encourage everybody to be part of a community that reminds each other of what those rules are because it's all about shared space and it's about safety. And therefore I will not be riding the scooters until I have my bicycle helmet in my bag until one appears at the Barbara Transit Centre which I'm really looking forward to at some point and I appreciate all your work on this. I was happy for the part that the Parks Department and I paid in getting this sponsorship going in the initial phase. Well thank you for your presentation Steve. I'm really excited about these upcoming, the upcoming RFP and contract negotiations. I think we've learned a lot in the last several years and And we know that we can probably ask for more and hold companies to a higher standard that want to share of our public assets. I'm very excited that bike share is going to be more broadly and equitably implemented across the whole city. And I'm pleased to vote aye. The ordinance is adopted and we are adjourned.
