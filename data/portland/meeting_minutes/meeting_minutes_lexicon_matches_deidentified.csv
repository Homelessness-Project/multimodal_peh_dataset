12_01_2016,affordable housing,"in order to evaluate the progress we've made towards our shared affordable housing goals. The data within the [ORGANIZATION] report indicates that housing affordability in [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION] has gotten worse. We know that this is an issue that disproportionately impacts low-income residents, communities of color, seniors, and individuals with disabilities."
12_01_2016,affordable housing,"As a council, we have taken incredible steps over [ORGANIZATION],  to increase and diversify the funding sources and tools we have to build and preserve affordable housing throughout our city. And I'd just like to take a moment to revisit and highlight a few of those steps. As a council, we voted to increase the funds dedicated to affordable housing in our urban renewal areas from 30% to 45%."
12_01_2016,affordable housing,"We released a $62 million solicitation for affordable housing proposals, the largest ever in the city's history. We established a construction excise tax dedicated to affordable housing and dedicated revenue from the lodging taxes of short-term rentals to affordable housing development and production. We all advocated tirelessly to lift the preemption on inclusionary zoning."
12_01_2016,affordable housing,"And we've worked hard over [ORGANIZATION] gathering input and crafting an inclusionary housing program that we will have a hearing on [LOCATION]. And our community has rallied around the issue of affordable housing, and together we passed a $258 million general obligation bond measure, the first bond measure in the city's history dedicated to affordable housing. We currently have almost 2,000 units, affordable housing units, in the pipeline."
12_01_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,"And by in the pipeline, I mean either being permitted or in construction. And I expect that number to increase significantly in [ORGANIZATION]. With all of our great work being done to address the affordable housing crisis in our city, we must not lose sight of the reason why we do this work."
12_01_2016,homelessness,"The actions that are mentioned, of course, the housing and homelessness emergency, even places like [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] asked me what difference the housing emergency has made because they, of course, have declared a state of housing emergency in [ORGANIZATION] recently. The press can't tell what difference it has made. So I'm able to point to several actions where tangible resources have resulted from your declaration of action, including code amendments and citing standards for emergency shelters."
12_01_2016,affordable housing,"You adopted the first step in additional tenant protections, which was ultimately upheld by action of the state legislature, and you've dedicated short-term rental revenues to affordable housing production and preservation. I might add that many cities are still debating whether or not to even tax short-term rentals. We're there."
12_01_2016,homeless,"We've led the [STREET], and many people look at [ORGANIZATION] as an example. Of course, we were...  disciplined, focused, and successful with the state legislature by working [ORGANIZATION] out of the DATE1 session to get the inclusionary zoning prohibition lifted after DATE2, and worked diligently for [ORGANIZATION] on the intergovernmental agreement with the chair of [ORGANIZATION] to create ORG1. As mentioned by Commissioner [PERSON], you enacted DATE4"
12_01_2016,affordable housing,"effectively a construction excise tax, which inures to a housing investment fund, which is tapping the hydraulics of the private market with respect to commercial, industrial, and residential development to help provide offsetting resources for people otherwise priced out of [ORGANIZATION]. And, of course, voters were given the prospect of the largest ever capital investment, a affordable housing bond, which was resoundingly supported, approving some $258.4 million for capital resources, which will be allocated in [ORGANIZATION] and spent within [LOCATION]. Could you remind me what the total amount of the construction excise tax is?"
12_01_2016,affordable housing,"They have over 13,000 units of affordable housing available and available. suburban [ORGANIZATION], places like outside of [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], and [PERSON]. GPE4, [PERSON] instituted it somewhat later, [ORGANIZATION], and they have about 8,000 units of housing currently in service."
12_01_2016,homeless,"The bond gives us that opportunity. And we've got to prepare people for the fact that if we're going to provide that housing to people at zero to 30, which to put the human face on it, as [ORGANIZATION] often does, full-time minimum wage workers, an older adult on SSI, a formerly homeless family, they're going to be slightly more expensive because they have to come with a subsidy. But if we don't tackle that problem, then all the good work that you're doing at the bottom of this slide about getting people into shelter and to transitional housing falls short because we have a bottleneck, unless we have the units that they can move into permanently."
12_01_2016,affordable housing,"So the half-a-million-dollar house is a fleeting rarity in [ORGANIZATION], and we look at these trends with great concern because obviously folks are pushed to the very edges of the city, if not out of the county and out of the state entirely as they manage their own budgets and try to find affordable housing. Can I ask you a question off the slide? Yes, sir."
12_01_2016,affordable housing,"So, you know, I think we'll have time to do that. And we are recognizing that any system requires a bit of an adjustment. We've been very transparent and open about the changes, and people are hedging their bets by investing their resources now to get their projects permitted, but they may well choose to include affordable housing instead.  and will be ready for them when they want to negotiate a particular voluntary program."
12_01_2016,affordable housing,"Process improvements are quite important, and I don't want to underestimate the value of  the governmental accountability and transparency review that Mayor [PERSON] and Commissioner [PERSON] have initiated. Our goal was to reduce the throughput time so that as we increase funding for affordable housing, that we also shorten the review time. And we are seeing tangible results in that regard."
12_01_2016,homeless,"And certainly not least, the building on the current partnership with [ORGANIZATION] for the successful implementation of [ORGANIZATION] is quite profound. And it should take and will take a significant amount of time in [ORGANIZATION]. So that's a preview of what we think are the next steps to respond to this continuing housing emergency."
12_01_2016,homeless,"Again, my major concern, again, is focusing on the 30 percent and below median income. I think we're beginning to really do that with the bond implementation that was approved last  and to really begin to focus on that area. Again, I'm looking at the chronic homeless."
12_01_2016,affordable housing,"Every city that does get an affordable housing bond, I would like him to match dollar for dollar on that housing bond. I'd like him to look at that very close. There's nobody that's been elected as a president who knows more about housing, building housing, development, financing than President-elect [ORGANIZATION]."
12_01_2016,affordable housing,"I'm with [ORGANIZATION]. We're a statewide association of affordable housing and community development nonprofits. I just wanted to come and thank you for this really important report and for shining the light on the affordability crisis and the stark racial disparities, the ones that are unacceptable and worsening in our city, both for rental housing and also for homeownership opportunity."
12_01_2016,homeless,"So I think that's something that we're going to have to remember, that that means that only 39% of renters actually are able to use transit or walk or bicycle. And we've got to plan for that at the same time as looking at  at housing units being big enough for families, recognising that some of the numbers are hidden in here because there's some cultures where there's a lot of people living in a single unit who actually would otherwise be homeless or in a shelter. So it's helpful to know the numbers, to see what progress we've made, and to give us even more intent to continue working until we get this."
12_01_2016,homelessness,"There are all kinds of ways to suffer from traffic collisions. I work in social services and [ORGANIZATION] talk to families on [ORGANIZATION] cash assistance or food stamps because a car crash has resulted injuries, lost jobs, homelessness, loss of transportation, addiction, and mental health problems. You passed a resolution to work toward [ORGANIZATION], and I ask that you continue in that endeavor."
11_08_2018,affordable housing,"We were, Commissioner [PERSON] and I, were at the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the new FAC0 in northeast [ORGANIZATION]. This is the first affordable housing project that is actually opened under [ORGANIZATION]. So it's a great milestone for the city of [ORGANIZATION], but I do apologize for my tardiness."
11_08_2018,affordable housing,"Thank you. PERSON0, can you please read the first item? Item [DATE], amend ordinance for interim use of the multiple unit limited tax exemption program for affordable housing in housing developments not subject to inclusionary housing to be in accord with [ORGANIZATION] modifications."
11_08_2018,affordable housing,"So just for some background and clarification that [ORGANIZATION] already covered a little bit, when inclusionary housing went into effect in [ORGANIZATION], it included use of the multi-program as one of the financial incentives provided to help offset the affordable housing being included in the new construction of new developments. And in [LOCATION] and then in [DATE], the city and county adopted a rolling cap on the amount of foregone revenue available for use with the multi-program, which kept the original $[ADDRESS] but allowed it to adjust to any housing surges, any cycles of development that increase during a given [ORGANIZATION] period. And as [ORGANIZATION] mentioned, in [DATE] we were here before you to adopt the multi-program for use of, for projects prior to the inclusionary housing."
11_08_2018,affordable housing,"Women voting was not constitutional, but we addressed it. It may be a heavy lift, but for the sake of our city and our state, bold decisions need to be made and work needs to be done. We just passed a constitutional amendment for affordable housing."
11_08_2018,homelessness,"The city could solve the homelessness issue, the [STREET] brawls, and the alleged need for more police all at once by asking its citizens to send 60% of their federal tax money to local causes instead of diverting it to weapons of war. The impulse to do something without a deep look at how differently it will affect democracy is the hallmark of a certain other elected leader,  who is now in [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] can do better than this, and we must."
11_08_2018,houseless,"[ORGANIZATION] commits violence against black, trans, people of color, immigrant, and houseless community members. It comes to the aid of white nationalist groups. [ORGANIZATION] is indeed a brand and a tourist destination."
11_08_2018,houseless,"I'd like to know why it is that money is being wasted on things like this, and by useless ordinances, when people are out on the streets dying on the sidewalks that are houseless. You sat here and you watched this woman cry in this very chair [ORGANIZATION], and did not know what to do with her. I applaud you for going out in the hallway and talking to her."
11_08_2018,houseless,"I encourage you to do that. In the country where some genius crunched the numbers, okay, of all the houseless people nationwide, you can house each and every houseless person 28 times each. My friends are literally dying on the sidewalk right now, and you're holding a meeting about this?"
10_09_2019,houseless,"This included a former cop, [ORGANIZATION], urban and forest firefighter who volunteers [ORGANIZATION] for over [DATE] to help people who are houseless, including preparing meals. He delivers to our houseless neighbors living near FAC0. We have four high school search and rescue volunteer first aiders."
10_09_2019,houseless,Panthers also support sensible gun laws to ban assault weapons and ban high capacity magazines. We support the [ORGANIZATION] boycott to end gun violence. Panthers support housing the houseless in our city and we support diversity and equity code changes.
12_02_2015,affordable housing,"That's why I wanted to cue this up, because if there's a chance that there's –  majority or better yet a consensus of the council to move forward on this I'm certainly willing to take more time on the old measure twice cut one proposition if there's simply not a majority of the council that wants to do this ever then I need to know that and that's that's an acceptable outcome though I think again the question will arise if we're not going to do this and  and we're not going to do nothing, what are we going to do to deal with the pace of demolitions and the loss of architectural character in our neighborhoods? And what are we going to do to provide funding for affordable housing? Because this is the first actual new revenue for affordable housing that we've come up with so far."
12_02_2015,affordable housing,"It's very enticing to find a new reliable source of revenue for affordable housing. By just saying that, it's indicative that actually this won't stop that many demolitions and that there will be a sizable chunk of change for affordable housing. It doesn't seem reasonable to me to pay for affordable multifamily housing by making single-family housing even more unaffordable."
12_02_2015,affordable housing,"One is a demolition of an older house to make [STREET] for affordable housing. And then we...  One of the things we've tried to encourage, we have different criteria for the applications, and one of them is how are you being innovative? So what are you doing to save time and reduce costs?"
12_02_2015,affordable housing,"uh these three projects reflect the total of 409 units 20 of which will be affordable units 27 will be affordable to households at 60 percent of median family income and 55 will be affordable to households below 80 percent of median family income these projects are also located in amenity rich areas of the city which we just where we desperately need more affordable housing  Two of the projects are located in [ORGANIZATION] in the FAC0 area, and one is in the [PERSON] neighborhood. In addition to providing affordability, all of the projects include universal design accessibility features, and 5% of the affordable units will be fully adaptable. Additionally, the developers of all three proposed projects have entered into technical assistance contracts with experts in minority contracting."
12_02_2015,affordable housing,"Is that your intent following [ORGANIZATION] of experience with these new guidelines to do a review and come back to us with any suggestions you might have for refinement? That's correct. I think in this market in particular, it's very critical that we are constantly monitoring the effectiveness of not just the multi-program, but all of our affordable housing programs, and if there's opportunities for revisions or tweaks, that we're aware of those and tracking that possibility."
12_02_2015,affordable housing,"He's thrilled to be living in a [STREET] where the services he needs to access are close. He doesn't have to travel very far to get services. And working with one more, having a [STREET] that gives vets priority to  And just having the access to that affordable housing piece is huge, especially to our organization that works with people who are all under that stress."
12_02_2015,affordable housing,"We've worked closely with [ORGANIZATION] over [ORGANIZATION] on their four mixed-use projects, totaling over 300 units of apartments they'll begin building in [LOCATION]. They've been responsive to many of our requests, and they will be an asset to our neighborhood. Awarding the multi-grant [ORGANIZATION] has applied for is a concrete action the city can take now, which will provide 57 affordable housing units in [ORGANIZATION]."
12_02_2015,affordable housing,"We also recognize the need for and support significant investment in a variety of affordable housing types in [ORGANIZATION] and citywide, including single-family home ownership, home repair, housing for families, veterans, and seniors, and assistance for first-time moderate-income homebuyers. We urge the [ORGANIZATION] to vote in support of ORG1 multi-grant application. Thank you."
10_12_2017,homeless,The buildings are too high to allow sun access and the view of the sky. The purple [ORGANIZATION] has almost disappeared. The tunnel connecting the courtyard and the park is too low and will be unfriendly and encourage homeless and social problems.
10_12_2017,affordable housing,"There are already too many market rate units. In addition, there's plenty of room in the Conway Master Plan for more housing than you can imagine with the FAR that's supposed to be moved there from this site and elsewhere. Finally, you have the promise of affordable housing."
10_12_2017,affordable housing,"Well, the affordable housing that's going into this program only has a [ORGANIZATION] commitment. So there's a [ORGANIZATION] commitment for affordable housing that will do harm to a DATE1 square. That's not the right balance."
10_12_2017,affordable housing,"The first is the ongoing disagreement about how to best solve the problem of the competing burdens that are placed on this property. The second is a series of arguments that are outside the actual legal criteria of the case, and I'd like to spend [TIME] with those because they attempt to set up a straw man, knock them down, and claim that means something, and I'd like to talk about those four points so we can make sure they don't distract from the central issues in the case. The first is the often repeated claim, which is in the appeal, that the applicant is driven by a goal of avoiding the city's affordable housing requirements."
10_12_2017,affordable housing,"Call it what you want, [ORGANIZATION] has a housing shortage. We have a significant shortage of affordable housing, nowhere near enough to meet current or future demand. We intend to build 200 apartments right at the future streetcar stop and still leave 65% of the site open to the public."
10_12_2017,affordable housing,"You already approved our multi-affordable housing proposal, and now 40 units are designated for households at or below 80% area median income. For those households, rents will be discounted 37% to 56%, representing $400 to $1,500 [DATE] in rent. For how long would that be?"
10_12_2017,housing crisis,"And while with the development we'll be extremely challenged by the lack of parking in the neighborhood, we also realize it's critical to [ORGANIZATION]'s future to solve the housing crisis in [PERSON] and beyond. While I'm not an expert on squares or the master plan, we support buildings that are part of the solution to the housing shortage. With a range of rents, including the inclusionary housing for families earning 80% of the [PERSON] median family income,  The development provides options to [PERSON]ers looking for stable housing, potentially including some of our employees."
10_12_2017,affordable housing,"It goes without saying the central dilemma of our affordable housing challenge is that housing costs more than local wages and have the power to buy or rent. It is a wage problem at one end. In the case of [ORGANIZATION] markets, a problem is strong demand for external equity and wealth on the other."
10_12_2017,affordable housing,"Inevitably, it boils down to math. For us, affordable housing for our [TIME] workforce is our biggest concern. We frequently have more than 20 positions that we cannot fill because of lack of rentals.  but stable housing for all Oregonians will lead to community resilience and a strong foundation for our business."
10_12_2017,homeless,"Now, you will have some issues like we're having right now because of the homeless situation. But generally, it can be managed. But I do think that it certainly opens up the neighborhood."
10_12_2017,affordable housing,"And I think the idea of opening up to the park, participating in the kind of events that would take [STREET], I think it's very engaging. The only other comment I'd have is that, if anything, I've learned in [ORGANIZATION] –  Is any nook and cranny anywhere we can find affordable housing, we need to get it. And we need to get as much of it as we can."
10_12_2017,affordable housing,"Having been charged with building out a number of master plans, I have been humbled by things called market timing, access to capital, private sector decision-making. The best of intentions, we're still going to build things out in a [STREET] that is flexible and is market-driven. And the best example of that on the negative end is how few cranes we had in the air during the recession, how difficult it was to do affordable housing."
10_12_2017,affordable housing,"So I'd like to just discuss the issue for me. I mean, we were told that we need this housing, therefore the public benefit outweighs the public damage. But the affordable housing is paid for by the tax abatement, and it's on the whole building, and it's not all that affordable anyway at 80%."
10_12_2017,affordable housing,"Well, I'm just on the issue. On the discussion point of view, I would agree with you, Commissioner [PERSON]. There is a benefit to the developer by doing the affordable housing."
10_12_2017,affordable housing,"I'm excited about the plaza. I'm happy we'll get some affordable housing. I agree with Commissioner [PERSON] and [PERSON], though, that we really do have a glut of market and luxury rate units."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"Commissioners, I'm [PERSON], co-chair of [ORGANIZATION]. Affordable housing and historic preservation are not mutually exclusive. We're here to tell you we support high-density housing throughout northwest [ORGANIZATION]."
11_29_2018,housing crisis; affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] is responsible for supporting affordable housing and protecting historic resources, which is the dilemma of the case you have in front of you here [ORGANIZATION]. And we believe you can balance these goals and that by doing so will ensure integrity, livability, and the continued special character of [ORGANIZATION]. And in the context of a housing crisis that is [LOCATION] in the making, [ORGANIZATION] is proud to have supported the over 3,500 new housing units that have been built in the neighborhood since DATE2."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"Not directly in the approval criteria, but certainly in the [STREET] this proposal has been presented, discussed, reviewed, and considered. Discussion of affordable housing has pervaded all aspects of this case, and even in the wording of the approval, and even in [TIME] of discussion this council has had. Well, the affordability-"
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"The inclusionary housing would require that 20% of the units be at 80% of median family income. But we think that their proposal that all of them be at 60% of MFI has colored all of us, all of our perceptions of this project, and has made us...  less harsh in our judgment of it because we know that the need for affordable housing is so dire. But we are concerned that if, for example, they were unable to get funding because they have not yet secured funding, if they weren't able to get funding, that approval would be sitting there and another developer could come along and say, oh wait, we got this approval, let's build this for market rate."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"But make no mistake about it, there's not a single person that doesn't want development on that site, not a single person that's happy that [ORGANIZATION] will be seismically upgraded and rehabilitated, and not a single person that doesn't want truly affordable housing there or affordable in the sense that it's cheaper than normal. There's more background. This is all on the record."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"They certainly disregarded their criteria in terms of scope and compatibility, and I really hope you will come out and walk this block. This is the treasure of [ORGANIZATION], and what is proposed there, in terms of scale and compatibility, it's a monstrosity. I support affordable housing, and the other part of my argument is, and I believe I'm allowed to say this, I think this is a bait-and-switch argument."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"We need affordable housing, and this site would be great for affordable housing. But there are no deed restrictions and there are no conditions here that would require these people to do anything other than say, we're going to give you affordable housing. They're going to give you market rate bait and switch."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"And I, as a taxpayer who believes that every neighborhood has a responsibility to provide affordable housing,  Let's make sure we can get it there. And it would be nice if it didn't look like a woman's prison, but I think it could be great, and I hope you'll stand firm and apply the law and reject this proposal and let them rework it so that it could be.  and have affordable housing in it. Thank you."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"So was there anything else that was in your email that you wanted to make sure the council is aware of? I primarily had the two arguments because having attended a number of meetings, I never really understood that they were going to push the affordable housing. And when [ORGANIZATION] said,  approved this, I was flabbergasted because the testimony was so strong that they were totally not meeting any of the criteria for this building."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"My historic buildings are fragile. We've testified in front of [ORGANIZATION] several times, and they've concurred with us time and again until it was announced that the new construction would be used for affordable housing. Nowhere in the Standards for Rehabilitation grants exceptions to the covenants based on who the tenants are."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"The standards are so restrictive, I'm not allowed to make major changes to my buildings due to their historic status. And the historic rentals are the last bastion of affordable housing in that area. My top rent for a two-bedroom is $1,650 a month."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"Okay. My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I live across the [STREET] in one of the [PERSON] homes. I want you to know that I'm an ardent supporter of affordable housing, have been so for [ORGANIZATION]."
11_29_2018,homeless; affordable housing,"I've worked in the field. I have been an affordable housing consultant, a housing and homeless services manager at the state, and a director of permanent supportive housing evaluation project, and have talked to a lot of – as part of my job, talked to a lot of people that live in housing. I'm asking that you reverse the [ORGANIZATION] decision and deny the proposed design."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"I commented extensively in my comments that are on the record, and you've already heard what some of the main points are, why this design does not meet the criteria. I wanted to talk a little bit about how expensive it is to build affordable housing [ORGANIZATION]. When I was a housing consultant and worked on several complexes that still exist [LOCATION] in [ORGANIZATION], I  I had a straightforward no-furls approach."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"What I tried to do was roll up my sleeves, look at all the requirements, make sure that before I moved a project forward that it moved forward, that it met all the requirements. And I guess I feel not very good that this project has taken so long, that there's been so many meetings with teams of lawyers where neighbors have been accused as [ORGANIZATION] when we really support an affordable housing project and would love to see one that is at an appropriate scale. Okay."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"under the criteria are not inconsistent with those federal standards so thank you sorry thank you and next we have PERSON0 PERSON1 good [TIME] if you'd like to go ahead and start sir you may uh mr mayor [PERSON] i'm PERSON3 i live two blocks from the project site i've lived in this neighborhood since [ORGANIZATION] both as a renter and as an owner  I support the development of scale-compatible, bona fide affordable housing in my immediate neighborhood."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"First, the development...  fails to meet multiple mandatory review criteria in the community design guidelines and in the alphabet historic district. Secondly, the proposal and the record, while making repeated references to the project as being affordable housing, includes no protections to ensure that the result will be anything other than full frontal market rate rental housing. The [ORGANIZATION] should take steps to immunize itself and the public from being party to a bait-and-switch scenario wherein the [ORGANIZATION] is baited to overlook dubious design and massing aspects of the proposal because the proposal might supply affordable housing."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"In [ORGANIZATION]'s development cost environment, delivering affordable housing depends on access to significant public subventions. And despite multiple applications for these by the developer, these subventions have yet to be forthcoming for this project. Because the project's history of difficulties in securing the necessary public subventions, there's a very good chance that the project will be switched to the type of market rate workforce housing, which the market is already supplying in quantity in this neighborhood."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"In short, we'd get an incompatible building which fails to deliver affordable housing, a worst of both worlds outcome. The [ORGANIZATION] could immunize itself and the public against such a bait-and-switch outcome by requiring the applicant, as a condition of approval, to enter into a recorded long-term affordable housing restrictive use agreement prior to the issuance of a building permit. Such agreements are a common feature of this world of affordable housing where they serve to align promises and outcomes."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"We have two additional concerns. We worry that the units built under the appellation of affordable housing will not remain that [STREET]. There is nothing in my knowledge that would prevent the owners from converting it to market rate housing down the line, as you so eloquently articulated."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"Second, I wanted to also emphasize that many of us, including [ORGANIZATION], have been advocates for affordable housing for [ORGANIZATION]. For myself, I'm coming up on DATE1 of housing advocacy, including when I worked for the city, working on the project [ORGANIZATION] that became a national model for...  for citing special needs housing and is still the outstanding model in this country and is one of the things I'm proudest of in my life. And finally, this doesn't relate specifically to the criteria but to the purpose of the historic districts."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"Good [TIME], ladies and gentlemen. My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I also live adjacent to this proposed development. I'd just like to essentially support what I feel are the failure based upon the massing of this project and also the design compatibility as well as no guarantee that this will be affordable housing projects.  because a number of people have commented on the bait and switch aspect of this thing."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"I would just like to comment briefly on, and I want to,  totally support all of those who commented in a positive [STREET] about their support for affordable housing. We've never said that. As a matter of fact, it's kind of curious that this is the third proposal on this site and the first one that has that as a catchphrase in terms of trying to attempt to get affordable  this approved."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"And it's also like within the zip codes within the city of [ORGANIZATION], it's 30th out of 32nd in median income. So clearly there is affordable housing here. There's below market, you know, people that...  don't have the same income."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"I would suggest that some form of  support for affordable housing in terms of assisting those rent assistance would be appropriate while we search for a credible solution to this problem, and I would love to see something there. Thank you for your testimony. Very good."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"Well, but I'm just getting the sense from the testimony that there's a belief that this project's being allowed to go forward when it wouldn't otherwise be because of the promise of affordable housing. It's actually under the maximum FAR. Yeah, thank you."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I'm the Executive Director of [ORGANIZATION]. We're an affordable housing developer of 1,800 units across the state."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"We introduced this project initially as affordable housing because we wanted to provide transparency to our intentions at the site. Yet our landmarks process has focused on the design and compatibility. The ideal is to provide affordable housing in a high-opportunity area that will provide access to transit, shopping, jobs, education, healthy foods and services, all while reducing the need and expense of a car."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"These are also the policy goals of [ORGANIZATION]. We appreciate all of the comments here [ORGANIZATION] in support of affordable housing. [ORGANIZATION] has experience with adaptive reuse and upgrade of historic properties, such as what we've proposed here."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"Before we conclude, I do want to address the requested affordability condition. I'll address it from a legal standpoint, and then [ORGANIZATION] can address it from a practical standpoint. There's been some suggestion that this affordable housing proposal has sort of colored ORG1 assessment and even, I guess, the neighbor's assessment of the design."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"Yes. As you know, that's down the [STREET] as we secure the funding to do the affordable housing. Commissioner [PERSON]."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"You know, our mission is to provide 100% affordable housing in what we do. I'm hesitant to commit to any level in this area. because that needs to be negotiated as the funding comes in."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"Thank you. First of all, I want to thank you for clarifying issues or concerns or suspicions about this being a bait and switch. [ORGANIZATION] is an absolutely reputable affordable housing developer, and I think it just speaks to the level of kind of anxiety and mistrust in the community, which is sometimes well-founded, but I don't think it is in this case."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,And the first thing I'd like to do is applaud the neighborhood and the district association for their welcoming of affordable housing into their neighborhood. I want to acknowledge that. Our firm specializes in affordable housing organizations.
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"We're in front of a lot of angry neighborhood associations throughout the city, and they have been clear from the beginning of this process that they welcome affordable housing. So I just want to acknowledge that. We do have a disagreement on questions of density and scale, though."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"And I would say that they go much further toward keeping the character of the district than leaving what we have there, which is two parking lots and the buck prairie sitting in the middle of it vacant. It is also significant, of course, that this building will have or may very well have 148 units of affordable housing. many for seniors who would benefit from proximity to [ORGANIZATION] and the services there."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"If you vote to uphold their decision, you can be confident that you're approving a building that has already been very carefully reviewed by both city staff and dedicated volunteers. I would urge you to vote yes on this [ORGANIZATION]. Affordable housing in particular faces great challenges in assembling its funding, and that funding can very easily be jeopardized by delay."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"We urge you to support the project that will preserve and size-lockingly retrofit FAC0, fall well within massing and unit limits allowed by the zoning, and offer 148 regulated affordable homes to [ORGANIZATION] households that desperately need them. We don't actually believe that it ever makes sense to take all of the social and human contacts out of any decision that we ever make in the public realm. We must consider that we are in the midst of an affordable housing shortage."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"Floors allowed under the 5-[ADDRESS]. It's part of the diversity of the district and  As a city, if we continue to add delays and costs to every housing project, not to mention unduly burdening non-profit affordable housing projects, then the overall cost to [ORGANIZATION] will be tremendous."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"And to allow this process to have neighbors be able to throw a temper tantrum and delay the creation of affordable housing, which everybody on this panel has said and everybody on this council has said that we desperately need, is contrary to our goals. I know there are lots of people all over the city who would love to have this power, but they don't. There are only a few types of neighborhoods that get to really bring these, that have the resources to do it."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"Going to Commissioner [PERSON]'s comment earlier, whether there are any bonuses given, no, there is a bonus available, but [ORGANIZATION] staff told the developers not to even come in at the four-to-one that's allowed by right. They didn't get anywhere near that affordable housing bonus that this council... These neighbors came to this council before and asked for that area to be downzoned, and you denied it because you have different priorities."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"So...  Through this process, through the pressure from [ORGANIZATION] and then through the three different design advice review hearings, which stretched over [ORGANIZATION], I would love to know the professional fees involved in taking your architects and your lawyers through that entire process. That's all money that's going to the cost of affordable housing that we desperately say we need. I would hope that this council would take this opportunity, one, to censure the neighbors who are bringing this, and two, to remove this ridiculous fee waiver for appeals because this behavior shouldn't be tolerated."
11_29_2018,homeless,"I'm the Executive Director at [ORGANIZATION]. For [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] has been helping low-income seniors get into housing or stay in housing. We would urge you from that perspective of knowing how many seniors are being left struggling to find housing that they can afford to stay in and how many homeless seniors there are needing housing."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"We would encourage you to uphold the [ORGANIZATION] approval of this project and deny the appeal. We also want to say that we have a long and strong partnership with [ORGANIZATION], who has a track record of building and managing affordable housing and making the [ORGANIZATION]-to-[ORGANIZATION] lives of the people who we serve, low-income seniors, more pleasant and gives them the ability to live independently for a longer period of time. This is, as someone earlier said, a high opportunity area."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"The location is ideal for seniors, and the unit sizes are also ideal. [ORGANIZATION] is willing to go through and has demonstrated that they're going through lots of hoops and challenges to identify a project that's going to be visually appealing as well as provide affordable housing. and [ORGANIZATION] approved the design."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,I have lived in [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION]. I know the area that we are just speaking of. And I think affordable housing is definitely something we need.
11_29_2018,homeless; affordable housing,"So one thing that I did hear [ORGANIZATION], though, was that we need to maybe put special conditions on this housing unit. concerning to make sure that we have affordable housing for residents, because that is a big issue in this city. As a student who lives on campus, I see a lot of the homeless problem, and it's a disgrace to our city."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"And I think if we had more affordable housing, that we could maybe take some of those people off the [STREET]. Thank you. Thank you."
11_29_2018,homeless,"[TIME], sir. My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I'm the Executive Director of [ORGANIZATION], an agency that's been very active in providing food services and a shelter for homeless people in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], for [ORGANIZATION]."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"As direct demonstration of this, [ORGANIZATION] is committed to preserving and fully renovating FAC0, which as it stands now is rapidly deteriorating. It is my opinion that all three buildings making up the redevelopment of this important site in such a resource-rich area as [ORGANIZATION] do an excellent job of directly complementing the adjacent dwellings in the community while reflecting the eclectic  nature, and the varied uses, shapes, and sizes of the buildings that make up the district as a whole. [ORGANIZATION] has an unparalleled track record of conceptualizing and delivering on mission-based affordable housing developments that became permanent resources to the communities they serve throughout [ORGANIZATION]."
11_29_2018,housing crisis; affordable housing,"They have selected a project team with [ORGANIZATION] of experience in preserving historic resources and the development of affordable housing in urban communities with a varied cast of community stakeholders. With that in mind, [ORGANIZATION] and their team have presented a project that meets historic landmark guidelines while providing an affordable housing resource in a resource-rich neighborhood for [ORGANIZATION] to come. There is a housing crisis throughout our community, as evidenced and supported by the voters for [ORGANIZATION] and the passing of [ORGANIZATION] 102."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"But if they can come up with language that basically gets us to the same [STREET] that it's going to be,  assurance that it will be affordable housing, we would fully support that. And we also note that [ORGANIZATION], the language in the decision specifically says, I quote, approve 148 units of affordable housing. So we're just asking council to implement that."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"I agree, but I think the key word there is should. That it should be, we should be blind to the content, but the reality is that we're human and that there is a dire housing shortage for affordable housing and that we can't help but be affected by that. That's, we've all talked about how ironic it is that we find ourselves opposing an affordable housing project."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"Um...  We know that it affected [ORGANIZATION] because it pervaded their discussion, and it's reflected in their written decision. We know it's affected us, and we don't expect council to ignore that factor either. And we think that in all three of our cases, it makes us a little bit less critical.  of this proposal because we want so much for affordable housing to happen."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,It does say in [ORGANIZATION] decision it's approved for affordable housing and then you very helpfully put in the definition from 30.[ZIP].B. Thank you. regarding what does that mean in city code.
11_29_2018,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] with [ORGANIZATION], [DATE] shelter for homeless and abused women, is right to the right where the first car is. And that's just about 150 feet away or so from FAC0 and all the houses on that. I show that just to provide you context."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"So if you're... The applicant is an affordable housing provider. I think that you can see in the [STREET] that the application was provided, was approved, that they do discuss it as affordable housing."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"If your question is does that give us a nexus to impose a condition, I think my advice would be no. The council's authority to impose conditions is based on the applicable approval criteria. So whether or not a finding mentioned the project that was proposed by the applicant as including affordable housing, that's still not the applicable approval criteria."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"That has never been looking at anything else. I think, you know, our concern with the covenant is based on it's already very, very difficult to provide affordable housing. And so to put anything else tied to this project makes lenders very uneasy."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"And quite frankly, we need as much flexibility as possible in talking to as many lenders as possible to get projects funded. So the decision currently says that it's for affordable housing, and it refers in the modification, the adjustment criteria to the studios and the seniors, etc.,  And then the appeal pointed out that the city's definition of affordable housing is at 80% of median family income, and the appellants were asking for 60%. So is 80% – you said that you don't have any projects that are providing housing at greater than 80%."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"I would note that the decision also notes that the type of housing proposed, the amount of parking, here I'm quoting page 5, the type of housing proposed, the amount of parking and density are not relevant to the applicable historic resource review criteria. So as we read the decision and the deliberations and all of that, the references to affordable housing were different. No, I agree with that."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,What I'm hearing from the applicants is they have no intention of doing any conversions. So I'm... What I'm trying to do is to acknowledge that the neighbourhood has expressed this concern and I think that they have presented their concerns in a very helpful and supportive [STREET] that is very respectful of affordable housing
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"So the fact that it may not be exactly the same as every other block in the district doesn't seem valid to me. Also, I would also love to guarantee that this  is affordable housing and remains affordable housing. I have no reason to believe that it won't be."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"I also appreciate [ORGANIZATION] and their members who work very, very diligently on this, in some cases under extreme pressure. And so thanks to [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] for your support of them and for this decision, which does say that it's for 148 units, new affordable housing units, including 48 senior units and 100 units of affordable workforce housing, and that no field changes may occur.  are allowed. So I think it's quite clear in the record what's intended."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"Because it is [ORGANIZATION], I'm very confident that you are going to get the funding and that this is going to move forward. So thank you very much for all you do for affordable housing as well as ORG1 and others. I think this is a remarkable project"
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"and I'm looking forward to seeing it done. And I will also say Commissioner [PERSON] is out of the state  on personal business. And I know he would say if he was here that, A, he also is relieved that we got here after we said no to the other one, and also that people who live in affordable housing should not have to sacrifice design and that they get to live in really wonderful places with great design."
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"But we have to also remember that it's a very complicated business to build affordable housing, very complicated. You know, as housing commissioner... I've always been baffled at the ability for these projects to actually break ground and happen because there's so many complicated funding streams, bank loans, all that stuff."
09_18_2019,homelessness,"High school graduation rates, homelessness. I think we're this, as you well know, we are the second worst in the country. So there are all these symptoms of this disease that [ORGANIZATION] has not been successful in addressing primarily because we have pretty much abandoned [ORGANIZATION] an effort to deal with this disease and that's changing in the end [ORGANIZATION] Recovers is part of that change and um the the proclamation uh Mr. [PERSON] that you're issuing [LOCATION] in [ORGANIZATION] and shoulder uh shoulder to shoulder with the other mayors and city councils around the state is helping us turn the tide on that and um helping the public to begin to understand that we're going to have to make some important choices."
09_18_2019,homeless,"Hello, Mayor [PERSON], honorable commissioners. Thank you for the opportunity to address you DATE0 My name is [PERSON] and I've struggled with problematic alcohol use and methamphetamine addiction for my entire adult life Several times in my life. I've lost everything that I've worked hard for I've watched my life Fall apart leaving me unemployed homeless friendless with my family unwilling to talk to me and without the resources to access treatment and Everyone is different, but for me the cycle was always the same."
09_18_2019,homeless,"Because addiction damages the part of the brain that allows a person to say no. For me to be able to say no, I need skills and resources. I work in a [INSTITUTION]."
09_18_2019,homeless; homelessness,"Whereas, [ORGANIZATION] supports addiction services in conjunction with its efforts to reduce homelessness and recidivism through [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and ORG2. And we should have added [PERSON] to that as well. Whereas the legislature has tasked [LOCATION] with producing a strategic plan to address addiction in the state of [PERSON]."
09_18_2019,homelessness,"And in this category, we saw respondents showing both significant similarities and some real differences as well. So as you can see from the chart, respondents, regardless of race and age, chose increasing housing affordability and addressing homelessness, that was one response, as their top budget priority. So that's the dark orange bar that you see across each category up at the top."
09_18_2019,homelessness,"So we did note that increasing housing affordability and addressing homelessness was the top budget priority. The second most cited budget priority was investments in city streets, sidewalk, and transportation. That's the yellow bar that you see across the different categories."
09_18_2019,homelessness,We asked this entirely new question that asked respondents to identify the city's greatest challenges. And here we heard loud and clear homelessness is perceived to be the top challenge facing [ORGANIZATION] according to our respondents. This perspective was shared across every race and age group.
09_18_2019,homelessness,"You can see that by the tall blue bars in each category. [PERSON] was also cited in multiple sections of the survey, including as a reason why people moved and why they did not participate in parks programs. Also, from this question, it's interesting."
09_18_2019,homelessness,"And there we noted that homelessness and drugs were the most commonly mentioned topics in that category, in that field. All right, I'm going to turn it over to [ORGANIZATION] for a few of the findings on civic participation. Great, so hopefully the maps are a little easier to look at."
09_18_2019,homeless,"It could be just how the questions asked. I often wonder, as I look at some of these slides, if you'd ask the question, if the homeless problem didn't exist, how would you feel about the following statement? Because I feel like the urgency and the magnitude of the homeless crisis is probably overlaying all of these responses."
09_18_2019,homelessness,"So one opportunity could be to create and support standardized practices or policies around program evaluation. Some examples of high priority areas identified by the survey are listed on this slide. The dissatisfaction with the city's response to homelessness despite significant program expansion and racial disparities in access to jobs, despite economic development programming specifically for communities of color."
09_18_2019,homelessness,"And I think a number of these questions have to be reviewed, particularly around homelessness, so that there's no prompt in the question, that there is a more generic question, and therefore we get an answer that's based on people's response to a generic question, not to one that's a little loaded up. I don't know anymore what the term trust in government refers to. My sense in talking to a lot of people in the community is, is that when they disagree with the council, they express the disagreement as a trust issue."
09_18_2019,homeless,"Hi, [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]. PERSON1, I really liked your response. about open elections"
12_06_2017,unhoused; houseless,"Stranded shadows in the doorways haunt And discarded blankets on benches beseech I will send him poems again [PERSON] number two  Help me to understand. Help me to understand why you carry guns and I carry blankets, or why cops murder children and cities murder the unhoused. Help me to understand why you have a roof while others get an overpass, or why simply existing with no [STREET] to go warrants arresting the houseless and refusing them rest."
12_06_2017,houseless,"Help me to understand why money flows for developers, yet city coffers are hollowed of food and shelter for people, or why black is to fear and white is to embrace. Help me to understand the hatred that pours from these halls, drowning the soul of this city in poverty, or why your garden grows manicured obsessions, while ours toxic compost from your unsustainable incompetence. Help me to understand why the fabric of the flag hasn't burned beneath your feet for punishing the houseless for existing."
12_06_2017,affordable housing,"So I'll turn it over now to [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON], who will make the presentation. But I also wanted to move an amendment that will provide an exemption for affordable housing. This was something we intended to do but somehow got left out of the mix, so I would now move that amendment."
12_06_2017,affordable housing,"ADUs, disaster replacement, alterations, and property line adjustments are exempt. And we have, as Commissioner [PERSON] introduced, we are including affordable housing to the list of exemptions in this code update. So how much have we collected?"
12_06_2017,affordable housing,"Colleagues, this is funding for a grant agreement that was passed earlier during this [ORGANIZATION]'s budget process for an affordable housing and community project in [ORGANIZATION] for a Pano. This is a project that I believe the [ORGANIZATION] strongly supports. However, we have amended the agreement to clarify that [ORGANIZATION] will report back to us the results of their investigation into allegations of discrimination, something that we as a [ORGANIZATION] take very seriously."
12_06_2017,affordable housing,"And as we all know, FAC0, where [ORGANIZATION] is located, is on the forefront of this change. So we're really here [ORGANIZATION] to thank you for your investment in the Roots to Rise campaign, which will support a 48-unit affordable housing complex on the corner of FAC1 and FAC2, as well as a community cultural center on the first floor. This development is the result of [LOCATION] of community-led planning and multilingual outreach."
12_06_2017,affordable housing,"PERSON0. Yeah, this is a great project. Good location for the community, but also much needed affordable housing too."
12_06_2017,affordable housing,The [ORGANIZATION] also raised the FAR on the site from 4 to 1 to 5 to 1 for this area highlighted in red. Their rationale there was to maximize redevelopment potential of the site and its inclusion of affordable housing in the future. So the property owner request...  is requesting basically the same building height limits common to the adjacent [ORGANIZATION].
12_06_2017,affordable housing,"The only, just to be clear, so the proposal we received was for, it's a  It's a concept for residential development, and certainly that would trigger affordable housing. If there was a building that came in and it was a straight commercial, no residential development, they would have the choice of going to the affordable housing fund, or they could go to the historic resource transfer fund. They have a choice if they're a purely commercial building."
12_06_2017,affordable housing,"I'd want to know more about that because the whole thing has been framed in terms of a benefit around affordable housing. And one of the things I don't fully understand is what the off-ramps are that could result in height without that benefit. And while we can't – it may be that for market reasons or other reasons it never gets built if we proceed with this, but I want to make sure there aren't other ways."
12_06_2017,affordable housing,"around FAC0 because, to me, that's one of the few compelling parts of this. And, again, that would just be a straight commercial building, which is somewhat we see mostly a lot of mixed use now. And most of our projects are triggering affordable housing."
12_06_2017,affordable housing,"You build 20 units or more, and you've triggered affordable housing. Couldn't we just say that there's no bonus for a commercial building? Well, one could, yes."
12_06_2017,affordable housing,We recently adopted a statement of principle on a community benefits agreement. We say on all of our affordable housing you have to meet a prevailing wage. I agree with you.
12_06_2017,homelessness,"Colleagues, the FAC0 is another example of the great partnership between  between our office, [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] and ORG2. This project will be a 13-story entirely affordable building with 203 multifamily residential units. Our commitment to develop deeply affordable units continues with this project."
12_06_2017,affordable housing,"The affordable housing set-aside was increased from the long-standing 30% to 42% for the life of the district. The rights for the development of a site within [ORGANIZATION] was identified, and [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] were directed to work together on the procurement of a developer for that site. This map shows you generally the entire boundaries, including the merged  adjacent education [ORGANIZATION]."
12_06_2017,affordable housing,"And when we undertook this project, it was a [ORGANIZATION]-owned site. So they led the procurement effort. But [PERSON] was joined at the hip to make sure that we had at least 200 units of affordable housing, with at least 62 of which were going to be affordable to people with incomes from 0% to 30% of [ORGANIZATION]."
12_06_2017,affordable housing,"And it's worth mentioning that Commissioner [PERSON] was very directly involved in the negotiation for that deep investment in affordable housing. PERSON1, can I just add one piece of history? Because I wish we did a historical slide on every project because we forget our history, and then the council turns over and history begins with the closing documents."
12_06_2017,affordable housing,"I began to research affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION], and I read of plans for the FAC0. It wasn't far from our home. I watched it being built, and I dreamed of living there."
12_06_2017,affordable housing,And I can once again return to contributing to my own retirement funds. Living in affordable housing has changed my family's life for the better. I desire you all to take this into consideration when planning for the future of affordable housing here in [ORGANIZATION] and with this project.
12_06_2017,affordable housing,"And I also want to acknowledge [ORGANIZATION]. I can't think of someone who had a bigger impact on affordable housing. And, you know, once upon a time, she actually shaped the editorial policy of the [ORGANIZATION] around focusing on the needs of the very low income."
12_06_2017,affordable housing,"And, Mayor, a lot of good ideas come to council, but unless there's a closer, they don't get done. And by my count, in the course of [ORGANIZATION], you have closed 443 units of affordable housing in our community, which is probably a record. One is the largest housing development that we've ever done of its kind."
12_06_2017,affordable housing,"And we have our own issues, our own obstacles, our own desires, our own culture around development. But what we all agree is we need more workforce and affordable housing, and we need it [ORGANIZATION]. And Commissioner [PERSON] has done a great job, or I can call him Commissioner Saltzman [PERSON]."
12_05_2019,affordable housing,"We got closest to the community with our community focus groups. We met with affordable housing residents at FAC0, we met with Somali families at [ORGANIZATION], and we met with international students attending [ORGANIZATION]. These focus groups informed on the ground needs as well as our project prioritization and analysis."
12_05_2019,unhoused,"As part of a massive urban renewal project to clear so-called troubled areas and make [STREET] for the construction of FAC0, high rises and parking, the community was impelled to move to a new neighborhood where they could rebuild homes and sacred spaces. The move came at great expense and sacrifice, but since then, the initial seeds of community, planted in a concentrated area of southwest [ORGANIZATION], have grown.  have grown into a thriving infrastructure of Jewish communal organizations, including the bustling [ORGANIZATION], six synagogues, a study center, various Jewish nonprofits, including a construction company, building tiny homes for the unhoused, kosher restaurants, youth groups, three preschools, and two [ORGANIZATION] schools. This is our home, and we are here to stay."
12_05_2019,affordable housing,"What it required was preservation or fee in lieu of preservation for 36 inch trees or greater. It included a higher fee in lieu of preservation for 36-inch trees or greater, and that included an exemption for certain affordable housing projects. It also included a notification requirement for tree removal of 36-inch trees or greater."
12_05_2019,housing crisis,"This is due to the lack of flexibility required to analyze trees on a case-by-case basis, even when unique development situations exist. Additionally, due to the unorthodox  fine structures that exist in Title 11, the city regularly adds tens of thousands of dollars to the cost of new housing. And this happens during our unprecedented housing crisis at a time when we all recognize we need to be building more housing within our built urban framework."
11_17_2016,affordable housing,"And [DATE]. [DATE].  [DATE] design and assign the [ORGANIZATION] annex from [ORGANIZATION] to ORG1 for development of affordable housing Okay, anyone want to speak on this item? If not, let's vote please"
11_17_2016,affordable housing,"I support staff's recommendation for the CM2 zoning proposed for this site. This amendment will allow for higher-density housing, which will increase the potential for affordable housing in the future... The site also sits at an important intersection of two major transit streets, allowing for less car-dependent transportation."
11_17_2016,housing crisis,There are many very good reasons to eliminate the requirements. They make our housing crisis worse. The [ORGANIZATION] parking mandate suppressed housing supply.
11_17_2016,affordable housing,"We understand that we have to minimize parking to accommodate increased density, reduce housing costs, and foster use of mass transit. We have the residential infill project, the recently adopted inclusionary zoning, and the recently passed affordable housing bond that should create more affordable housing. We strongly believe that the city should give these new tools a chance to work before eliminating minimum parking requirements."
11_17_2016,affordable housing,"We don't need more. What we do need is more thoughtful and active approaches to managing the abundant supply so that other worthy things like affordable housing, transit access, [STREET] trees, and safe passage for bikes and pedestrians can be provided within and close to our mixed-use corridors. Let's get our parking strategy right, do away with minimums, and better manage the supply with [ORGANIZATION].  we look forward to working with the city on further refinements and implementation of the comprehensive plan thank you thank you good [TIME] mary good [TIME]"
11_17_2016,housing crisis,"And if this bike path were to be continued, it would probably wipe out 100 homes. With the housing crisis as it is now, we wouldn't want  to make the park less viable by taking out 100 or more homes for a bike path that it does not have any access to [ORGANIZATION]. There's a 30-foot drop."
11_17_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,"Thank you. Our affordable housing crisis has been exacerbated by reserving shelter for automobiles rather than human beings. And the future of this city relies on how we take care of the humans that live here, not the automobiles."
11_17_2016,affordable housing,"In some ways, parking requirements end up raising the income requirements for living in transit-accessible neighborhoods. Parking requirements also work at cross-purposes with inclusionary zoning. Inclusionary zoning needs new housing supply to add affordable housing units, but [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] parking mandate has already suppressed housing supply."
11_17_2016,housing crisis,Using parking requirements as incentives for inclusionary zoning will only limit it  its effectiveness. We have parking management tools at our disposal that are better at managing on-[STREET] parking and don't exacerbate [ORGANIZATION]'s housing crisis. Please pass Amendment 34 and [DATE].
11_17_2016,homeless,We are a crisis of housing. So I support city to have this zone as a [ORGANIZATION]. So we can help in homeless with it.
11_17_2016,homeless,You have problem with homeless. I know that. You side so hard.
11_17_2016,affordable housing,"So now everything's kind of turned into a 60-foot apartment building, which could conceivably really turn into an enormous number of canyons through inner southeast and even into the residential areas, because if you look at where the [ORGANIZATION] is, there's some CG that goes upstart. And so I have a concern about that. So I want to make sure that those bonuses stay true bonuses and aren't just sort of waved away with this idea that since everyone is going to include some form of affordable housing that we don't have to worry about the height anymore."
11_17_2016,housing crisis,"What's your name on the record, [ORGANIZATION]? [ORGANIZATION] Klotz. And we've heard a lot about the housing crisis [ORGANIZATION], and this amendment is another tool we can use to solve it."
11_17_2016,affordable housing,"And you'll see in the map that it basically is three parcels that may be spot zoned. Mayor [PERSON], in all due respect, I understand that there's a concern about affordable housing and the potential speculative project that might come in there. But I think it might be a little bit of a short-sighted, again, all due respect, to spot zone a particular site in favor of a speculative project that may or may not happen when we're implementing the [ORGANIZATION] plan that's going to be in [STREET] for [LOCATION]."
11_17_2016,housing crisis,I'm not going to throw numbers about the housing crisis at you and everything. You guys are fully aware. I'm just going to ask you as...  I was raised to respect my elders and that I would ask you to just give us a little respect to and not displace us because we have nowhere to go.
11_17_2016,housing crisis,"There are nesting eagles out there, and they're doing quite well without a bike path or any other things to, you know, upset them. So, yes. So we're just asking that you...  delete [ORGANIZATION] please do not put in this bike path it needs to it's just so unsuccessful and with the housing crisis that's already there we have a lot of concerned residents and that's what we're asking oh thank you very much and appreciate you coming on behalf of your neighbors as well thank you mr [ORGANIZATION] welcome good [TIME] mayors and commissioners thank you for being here i'm [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION] representing [ORGANIZATION]"
11_17_2016,affordable housing,"So I think actually changing that changes the intent of [ORGANIZATION], and I would like to make sure that we support that as we have in past and with our discussion with you. Again, with the erosion of the continued development in the face of the historic district, it's been very difficult. As a neighbor, I do want to say I support the affordable housing."
11_17_2016,affordable housing,"I just support the affordable housing within the guidelines. So working within the actual overlay within the activity, love to have them there, just not a six-story building. Thank you."
11_17_2016,affordable housing,"And what we really want is the two-to-one to be confirmed because it's consistent with what would be allowed with the overlay zoning. And I strongly support affordable housing and historic preservations. The piece of paper that you got from me on the reverse side of it, I looked up.  tons of examples where affordable housing is developed in historic preservation."
11_17_2016,affordable housing,"They work together. And we think, or I think, because I have a background in affordable housing, that a project of about 45 units or so would fit on that site, and it would increase the number of units on that site. There are currently six."
11_17_2016,affordable housing,"There is also much uncertainty regarding housing affordability over [ORGANIZATION]. We have no idea what may come from the federal government, which is why it's important for cities to take the lead to provide affordable housing. Requiring parking necessarily increases housing prices in neighborhoods where people have other transportation options."
10_05_2016,affordable housing,"Our statistics clearly show that there continues to be great disparity of economic opportunity, affordable housing, education gap, over-representation of Native Americans in our justice system, and much more. But it's the tribal [STREET].  to come together as a community to accomplish our goals. Therefore, [ORGANIZATION], one of the nine federally recognized tribes in [ORGANIZATION], endorses this proclamation and is thanking you for proclaiming [ORGANIZATION] to be [LOCATION]."
10_05_2016,homeless,"I'm the Director of [ORGANIZATION], and with me [ORGANIZATION] is [ORGANIZATION]. He is a Senior Program Specialist in [ORGANIZATION], formerly is from [ORGANIZATION]. So he is one of the folks who's joined forces with the county staff to constitute the office and  and do this work in as collaborative a [STREET] as we can."
10_05_2016,homeless; homelessness,"As the Mayor said, we gave this presentation to [ORGANIZATION]. It represents the system-level outcomes, the work of a community of nonprofit providers that are dedicated to helping people hopefully avoid becoming homeless at all. If not that, then they're helping them move out of homelessness and back into permanent housing, and where neither of those are an option, providing access to a safe [STREET] to sleep and a shelter bed at [TIME]."
10_05_2016,homeless; homelessness,"I work at [ORGANIZATION] ORG1. [TIME], I think just to remind folks, [ORGANIZATION], ORG2 entered into an ORG3 with our multiple partners with [LOCATION], the county [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION].  to bring together a wide base of community partners who could work together on our collective goals to end homelessness in [PERSON]. With the leadership of this council and your colleagues at [PERSON], you've charged this group with answering a central question, what would it take?  Just asking that question in that [STREET] has in and of itself been transformative."
10_05_2016,homelessness,"It's brought our partners to the table over [ORGANIZATION] and bringing some of the most creative, collaborative work that our community has put to addressing homelessness in [LOCATION]. And it's been in the face of, as [ORGANIZATION] talked about, one of the most challenging housing markets we've ever experienced. So through that work, we've developed shared strategies and priorities for additional investment that begin to bring our community's response to the kind of scale that it would require to actually make a meaningful difference."
10_05_2016,homeless; homelessness,"And this council's support for and direct involvement in that process has been crucial. So [DATE] we'll report...  our outcomes from [ORGANIZATION] of implementing those new strategies with the additional investments. Lest we bury the lead, on the first slide here in your packet, we were able to increase our overall service investments by more than $7 million [LOCATION] with a focus on placing people into housing from homelessness, preventing people from becoming homeless in the first [STREET],  expanding our shelter capacity, and focusing very clearly on racial equity in homelessness."
10_05_2016,homeless; homelessness,"And across all of those goals, we were able to exceed our initial goals for services. placing more than 4,600 people from homelessness into housing over the course of [ORGANIZATION], preventing more than 9,[ADDRESS], and helping more than 6,600 people access emergency [TIME] shelter. So [PERSON] we'll go into detail on some of those outcomes."
10_05_2016,homelessness,"So just to remind you of some of the work that we did to model out that question of what would it take, in this graph, the orange line is the key line. It's a look at our estimated unmet need for people experiencing homelessness, unmet housing need among people experiencing homelessness in [ORGANIZATION], starting in [ORGANIZATION] with more than 4,000 people at [LOCATION] who still had an unmet housing need. And your overall charge to our collective effort was to reduce that unmet need by half over the course of DATE2."
10_05_2016,homelessness,"In answering then what would it take, we looked at the green line, which is how many additional people would we have to begin to [STREET] from homelessness into housing, as well as the blue line.  which is how much would we have to begin to increase our homelessness prevention efforts in order to reduce that unmet need by half over that time. And during [ORGANIZATION], the answer to that question, what would it take, was at a minimum beginning by starting to [STREET] 750 additional people into permanent housing above what we had done in [LOCATION]. And this is what we were actually able to do."
10_05_2016,homelessness,"So in [ORGANIZATION], we were able to [STREET] more than 4,600 people into permanent housing from homelessness. Again, the goal had been to increase by 750 over [LOCATION], over our prior baseline, sorry. And that 4,600 actually represents an increase of 1,200 people."
10_05_2016,homelessness,"But our overall system goals are very much in the context of existing and persistent racial disparities in homelessness. Most significantly here, you see that African Americans make up about 7% of the population in [ORGANIZATION], but make up about 24% of people experiencing homelessness in [ORGANIZATION]. So with these persistent and real disparities in homelessness, we're"
10_05_2016,homelessness,"And across the bottom in orange, you see the percent of people experiencing homelessness in [ORGANIZATION] who are of that racial group. So in general, what you want to see for our communities of color is that the percent of people placed into housing should be higher than their percent of people experiencing homelessness in order for us to begin to address the racial disparities that are there. And there, what you see nearly across the board is that in [ORGANIZATION], we were able to increase the number of people of color who were placed into permanent housing, as well as either maintaining or increasing the percentage of people who are placed into housing."
10_05_2016,homeless,"We were also able in [ORGANIZATION] to maintain our overall prevention effort. We newly served 4,100, more than 4,100 people with additional assistance to prevent them from becoming homeless. And we were able, both newly served and people who had been served in [LOCATION], able to serve 9,300 people total with prevention assistance."
10_05_2016,homelessness,"And just to be clear, the tool we use there mostly is the short-term rent assistance? Correct. And that's why consistently we hear from you that's one of the best investments we can make to prevent people from falling into homelessness, rapidly rehouse."
10_05_2016,homelessness,"And so that dollar is really one of our best tools. Is that right, [ORGANIZATION]?  That dollar plus some of the staffing capacity at organizations that can engage with the families, negotiate challenges that are going on in their tenancies with landlords to avoid receiving evictions. So it's a combination of the short-term assistance dollars and also that housing retention or homelessness prevention staffing capacity that our organizations have."
10_05_2016,homelessness,"Thank you. And again, to look briefly at the prevention outcomes by race and ethnicity, recently at a [ORGANIZATION] meeting, we heard testimony from several of our culturally specific providers who talked about significant differences in how communities of color experience homelessness. Many are doubled or tripled up rather than accessing emergency shelter."
10_05_2016,homelessness,"And so our prevention resources are incredibly important for these communities of color, especially when they're delivered in alignment with our anti-poverty systems. So here the increases in the number and percent of African Americans and Latinos that were served with prevention is really helping to stem the inflow that's driving so much of the persistent racial disparities in homelessness. Thank you."
10_05_2016,homelessness,"And now to talk a little bit about safety off the streets or shelter options, I want to orient you just a little bit to this slide. The dashed line in sort of the yellow color is the baseline capacity going into [ORGANIZATION], the number of shelter beds and transitional housing beds that we had available in our community. The blue line up at the top represents our estimate of the number of people who would be experiencing homelessness in [ORGANIZATION] on [TIME]."
10_05_2016,homelessness,"To the degree that the blue line is above the dashed line, you'll see [STREET] homelessness in [ORGANIZATION]. There isn't a shelter bed for every person. So we'll get the [ORGANIZATION] worked out."
10_05_2016,homeless,"So that's a 40% increase overall in the number of people that we were able to serve through emergency shelter. And just the last number that I'll leave you with is, I think, a critical number and one to let soak in for a little bit. This is the overall number of people who were served across our entire system of homeless services, both people who were newly served and who continued to receive services who begun in services in [ORGANIZATION]."
10_05_2016,homeless; homelessness,"So one additional piece of information to make sure you have is that when we're identifying these numbers, these are just the organizations that put their data into our homeless management information system. That means they typically receive some kind of public funding. There are also many other organizations that don't receive public funding doing work with people experiencing homelessness.  whose data is not represented here."
10_05_2016,homelessness,"Go ahead. Call the first one, please. Item [DATE], request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel regarding homelessness."
11_09_2017,homeless,"We've also had speakers share about volunteer opportunities at the hospital with [ORGANIZATION] groups or nonprofit [ORGANIZATION] groups and different services provided for mental health and homeless vets. Mostly we advocate for city employees, people trying to get a job with the city. Sometimes it's difficult for them to translate their experiences from the military into what the city [ORGANIZATION] looks for, for qualifications for the job."
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"they are asking to have their property exempted from the proposed zoning provisions they have also threatened to sue the city if city council refuses to grant this exemption but they have not stopped with the threat of a lawsuit they have cleverly attached their personal agenda to several real and difficult housing issues the city currently faces  They have woven the desire for personal gain into a narrative of affordable housing, gentrification, and not in my backyardism. Because these are high-level housing agenda issues, their efforts have fallen on receptive ears. They have been able to enlist media outlets and two respectable nonprofits to spread misleading information under the umbrella of their chosen narrative."
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"I'm currently working with [ORGANIZATION] on a potential affordable housing project in the neighborhood. while i'm working with ORG1 and care deeply about affordable housing the reason i'm here is to address the greater impact that down zoning in the alphabet district can have on this neighborhood other inner city neighborhoods and our metro area as a whole not only is allowing for higher densities in our inner city neighborhoods a staple of sustainable city development it is also a key ingredient in our effort to provide housing for our low and middle income citizens  While it is never the right time to restrict access to neighborhoods that offer connections to jobs, public transit, shopping, and services, it is especially short-sighted to do so at a time when our city is struggling to provide housing, and so many are in need of such a [STREET] to live. As the owner of an architecture firm that has received several awards for our work in historic preservation, I care deeply about the historic fabric of the neighborhood and believe historic resource sources should be protected."
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"This will not solve the affordable housing problem, to say nothing of tearing at the visual fabric of the neighborhood and the cachet of PDX. I actually think that ADUs are more consistent with the design because then one –  set of aesthetics would go with both buildings. Having supported her testimony, I would like to add some other ideas."
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"It is listed as number 17 on [ORGANIZATION]. The ownership's ultimate vision for these properties includes a five-story industrial flex building to accommodate small space users, such as startup minority and women-owned businesses, as well as build much-needed affordable housing as part of mixed-use development. And as you know, brownfield remediation of these properties will cost ownership hundreds of thousands of dollars in  While we appreciate the city's need to dedicate an adequate inventory to land zoned for the exclusive employment-related uses, we would still prefer the land to remain zoned EX so that the buildable development justifies the projected cleanup costs of the site."
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"um so i'm uh i'm thinking and i think some of the planning commission members are taking the same [STREET] that the removal of the parking requirements in mixed-use zones would help that um to help you know allow for more affordable housing um  up zoning from [ORGANIZATION] to FAC0. I support the up zoning of all the areas throughout, mostly southeast, where the comp plan designation has been FAC0 for DATE0, and now the planning bureau has decided  studied them and decided which areas could be up zoned to our 2.5 i support that the ground floor height bonus that the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood spoke about i support that bonus which allows for taller ground floors and you know gives you an extra five feet on the on the height of the building but also an extra five feet on the step back because it wouldn't make sense to have the floor plates all jogged back down at the rear to accommodate have not that not have the additional height there but have it on the main part of the building  I support the major city bikeway designation on FAC1 from FAC2 to [PERSON]."
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"And it would also help us with the developmental process to be able to add some affordable housing for marginalized communities like veterans, immigrants.  for seniors, for African-Americans to come back into the community. So we thought about why not come here in front of you and see if you are really serious about the city's efforts to, you know, to –  to combat the ills of gentrification and see whether or not you could, with the stroke of a pen, say, okay, we're going to give you this additional entitlement. So that's the nature of my coming here to testify in front of you [ORGANIZATION] as an African American and a person that's a strong advocate of  reversing the ills that have happened to us from a historical perspective, and I trust that you will do the right thing."
10_13_2016,housing crisis,"I'm the Executive Director of [ORGANIZATION]. My husband and I have lived in an apartment in northwest [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION], and we raised our twin sons in the neighborhood, [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]. I think I know I don't need to tell you about the housing crisis, but I'm going to mention the number again, which we keep updating."
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"So it seems to me with all that we're dealing with, and we've said we need many different approaches, a private owner making land available, one of our very best nonprofits coming together to do this. And I think the bigger issue of whether it's  three to one or two to one is, is this a neighborhood that should have more housing and should it have more affordable housing? And,  Is compatibility with a historic district really defined by height?"
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"Our proposal is to retain that resource.  and build around it on the site. So again, kind of a hybrid model of meeting both the historic preservation goals, but also the affordable housing goals. I mean, you have [ORGANIZATION]."
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I'm a resident of northwest [ORGANIZATION]. I'm here to oppose any down zoning in [ORGANIZATION], and in particular the down zoning being requested south of [PERSON]. I entirely agree with the testimony you've heard from affordable housing advocates."
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"We have carefully been planning for [ORGANIZATION] a mixed-use apartment project that would cater to those needs, both for short- and long-term housing needs with walking distance to FAC0. The proposed zoning change would actually cut our plans in half.  which would limit the amount of housing we could provide for those in need, and then also negatively affecting our plans to incorporate affordable housing in the project as well. So we respectfully request for the [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] parcels on FAC1 to be up-zoned instead of down-zoned to [ORGANIZATION]2 or 3."
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"And so this down zone, you know, you've heard a lot about affordable housing [ORGANIZATION]. I'm not going to reiterate that. As a commissioner of [ORGANIZATION], I am fully aware of the depth of the problem."
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"As a developer, I also understand that by constricting the yield out of a piece of property, the ability to cover debt –  when you have to reduce that yield, becomes very questionable. And so likely no affordable housing other than requirements for inclusionary zoning, which I think can be very positive if there are appropriate incentives for it. What we really want to see is a CM3 designation on this property to allow a really well-developed project that allows for commercial services as well as  both market rate and affordable housing."
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"We are not talking about a huge swath of this city. They contain, however, the majority of our historic resources. So giving them a little protection is not going to stymie our quest for affordable housing."
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"Furthermore, it makes little sense to me that advocates pick some of the most expensive real estate or land in the city in which to locate affordable housing. That kind of goes against my logic. And I kind of have to throw out the question, why is the central city, which is already dense, bearing the bulk of the burden of adding more density while outlying neighborhoods that are crying for new and better development seem to be going wanting here?"
10_13_2016,housing crisis,"But we have a housing crisis, as you well know. The number is 23,295 units that we need in this city. We need this for people of extremely low income, which means you make less than $15,000 or $13,000 a year."
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"And for [ORGANIZATION], we've added almost 1,200 units. Our biggest dislike about that is none of it's affordable. Right now, we have over 800 regulated affordable housing units in our neighborhood."
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"And we have a lot of market affordable housing that we're afraid we're going to lose in that core area. You know, [ORGANIZATION] is the only plan outside the central city that has an affordable housing bonus. We have an affordable housing bonus in our plan district."
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"A few blocks north of the site that keeps being talked about, you could build up to 7 to 1 FAR and 120-foot tall building if you do affordable housing. We've been promoting affordable housing for a long time. We are not NIMBYs."
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"But I want to start more generally. I believe that providing affordable housing is one of the most important things we can do. In fact, that may be my largest political donation ever to support the bond campaign."
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"However, I'm really concerned that at this time of crisis, affordable housing and its need has begun to trump every other goal. And I want to remind us that we're planning for [ORGANIZATION]. And while we have a crisis [LOCATION], we should not allow one goal of our many to trump everything else, to abandon our system of corridors and centers, to do other things that are not consistent, because we need to all work together and continue to do that."
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"Other options would be to extend the city's inclusionary zone affordable housing bonus to that site so they can get the density done. Finally, we could also include the [ORGANIZATION] affordable housing bonuses and extend them into the historic district. But the most important thing is that the zoning reflect the closest reality to what's desired, what's there [ORGANIZATION], and does not mislead people."
11_22_2016,affordable housing,"And the distinction would be that would allow potentially those campuses to entertain the idea of building potentially affordable housing that wasn't directly affiliated with their campus, which is something that [ORGANIZATION] is considering as an option. I'll move. Or let me just –  It would also allow them theoretically to develop market rate housing and use that proceeds to subsidize some part of their operation."
11_22_2016,affordable housing,"My guess is, from a public policy point of view,  And given the locations of the campuses, there'll be tremendous interest if there is to be other housing, housing for other than faculty and students, to make it affordable because there is a shortage of affordable housing generally for people who are students or full-time minimum wage workers. So I have confidence in the political process. So keep going if you want."
11_22_2016,affordable housing,"The idea being that we know that older adults like to be adjacent to academic institutions, take advantage of programming, so perfect case would be within the university district. We also know that we have some churches, historic churches in this city that are losing their congregations, and what better [STREET] if they were to develop a parking lot or something than to have housing for older adults that then could be part of that community. So that's not before us, but I am personally intrigued by the idea particularly of housing for older adults and affordable housing on campuses because of the other amenities that campuses offer the residents."
11_22_2016,affordable housing,"Okay. You heard some testimony from affordable housing providers and some property owners concerned about the loss of density in such a close-in urban neighborhood, and then you heard from [ORGANIZATION] and historic preservation advocates that the two-to-one was more appropriate. ORG1 recommendation kind of split and kept four-to-one on the south side of the district, which is close to the [ORGANIZATION] station and where there is a slightly higher preponderance of –  of bigger historic buildings."
11_22_2016,affordable housing,"And then option C is a –  A different version, which would remove the parking requirements from residential developments, but only if the building is following one of several paths that includes affordable housing, either bonuses or the future mandatory or voluntary inclusionary housing provisions. And so this relates to the upcoming consideration of that ordinance. So, Mayor, can I make a suggestion?"
11_22_2016,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] brings the affordable housing piece into the equation. And then, depending on the outcome of that, bring Motion B in, because that's essentially Motion C stripped of the affordable housing component. I would like to have an up-or-down vote on [PERSON]"
11_22_2016,affordable housing,"And so that would still allow those projects that are using the voluntary bonuses to get a relief on the parking, but projects that didn't do that. An example might be if someone tried to build a building just based on the standard code  Without using the bonuses for affordable housing, they would trigger the parking. If they used the bonuses, they wouldn't."
11_22_2016,affordable housing,"He's just not sure that this is the right process to achieve the goal. Here's my ultimate concern, [ORGANIZATION]. Every time we've talked about how to seize an opportunity to leverage affordable housing of late, and I'll cite to the example on transit corridors, where we said, hey, maybe we could down zone and then give people bonuses as a [STREET] of getting affordability."
11_22_2016,affordable housing,And I think that the idea that we should preserve a policy that increases the cost of housing as part of a strategy to raise more affordable housing is as convoluted as it is now. I understand that. I guess I want to respond as well.
11_22_2016,affordable housing,"Other comments? Commissioner, what we'll have to do to have an effective IT program is to have a rule and a package of incentives to make it economically feasible to create housing that includes affordable housing at the lower end. If you take cost of parking off the top at the beginning, you get as much closer to making the affordable housing economically viable as you do if you take it off somewhere down the line."
11_22_2016,affordable housing,"Thank you, Mayor. Rather than guessing and using our own intelligence to figure what might or might not happen, I think we should do 51, which is the transportation demand management, go look at the whole issue, have the different discussion on inclusionary zoning and have this as certainly one of the options for what we can give developers in return for affordable housing. We need to have a separate discussion on parking alone."
11_22_2016,affordable housing,"I mean, we heard from 24 people. That doesn't seem a lot, given the far-reaching nature of it. Just so we're clear, there was a lot of testimony about the need –  to leverage affordable housing, and I've just come up with a tool, not a perfect tool, but a tool to make sure that the benefit we're conferring results in a public benefit by linking it to [ORGANIZATION], which, again, from staff's interpretation of this, will mean in virtually every case this is exercised, but this becomes one of the tools."
11_22_2016,affordable housing,"And as I read it, Commissioner [PERSON] says that that's when there's affordable housing and when it's near transit. Right. And it also includes all the errata that we have put together in this notebook."
11_22_2016,affordable housing,"Well, as all my colleagues know, the inclusionary housing legislation that passed in [ORGANIZATION] requires that local governments provide some sort of an offset to the development for affordable housing under the law. And as we move into considering and debating this in [ORGANIZATION], I think it's very important that we hold on to this powerful incentive we do have to get developers to,  take advantage of the inclusionary zoning, whether it's the voluntary 60% of median income or below, or the required 80% of median income. But as the modeling and everything shows, being able to waive on-site parking is a powerful, powerful tool, and we need to keep it for the use for inclusionary housing."
11_22_2016,affordable housing,[ORGANIZATION] did you hear that that's you i know i didn't i haven't been hearing the uh the call um i what we recommend that we're going to have irrational requirements that we can then waive to encourage affordable housing uh we should also adopt the requirements that everybody get a pony when they get a new house and then we can wait back for affordable housing um  Anything else?
11_07_2018,affordable housing,"And we can go on and on with things that happened [TIME]. I would like to take a moment and thank the [ORGANIZATION] voters for supporting affordable housing. We had two ballot measures [ORGANIZATION], ballot measures 102 and 26-199."
11_07_2018,affordable housing,"Each almost got to 60%, which if you go back, and [ORGANIZATION] is nodding, and [ORGANIZATION] follows this closely. You go back [ORGANIZATION], people were saying that both of them were being a heavy lift. [ORGANIZATION] voters said yes for affordable housing on both, almost to 60%."
11_07_2018,homelessness,"It's recycled material that comes off of the –  The highway advertising signs, the billboards you see, they're actually made of a canvas-like material. I actually didn't know that because I've never been close enough to one to actually understand that. And I just thought it was really a very positive thing to see women who are experiencing homelessness  in an environment where they are respected and part of a community, and taking an incredible leadership initiative to start a company that is actually quite successful."
11_07_2018,affordable housing,Voters in the state of [ORGANIZATION] said yes to affordable housing. They reaffirmed overwhelmingly their commitment to sanctuary status for the state of [ORGANIZATION]. They said yes to letting women make their own reproductive decisions.
11_07_2018,homeless,"News powwow down here. I could walk out my front door and see one right next door. And I, because there's a [ORGANIZATION] park there, and it became a bed and breakfast for the homeless."
11_07_2018,homeless,"And there were numerous assaults going on there. I've been down here more than once, told you the face of homeless in the city is the one with the black eye and the bloody nose. And nothing, nothing was done about it."
11_07_2018,homeless,"I will also bring somebody from [ORGANIZATION] because I know that they have been in touch with people in that community on a regular basis. I'll get it from ORG1 and have it ready for you there. I prefer gas station coffee, but stronger the better."
11_07_2018,homeless,"[DATE], request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel regarding being homeless with a registered emotional support animal. She needs a clear path to come through. PERSON1, could you please move the bag?"
11_07_2018,homeless,"Now, she...  It's just as dependent on me as I am of her, and we're very bonded. When I found myself homeless [ORGANIZATION], I wasn't able to take care of my home that I'd lived in for [LOCATION]. And because I didn't pass my inspection, I lost my housing."
11_07_2018,affordable housing,"And I realize [ORGANIZATION]'s not here [ORGANIZATION], but he has served [PERSON] on this council and has provided great benefits to not just the whole community of [ORGANIZATION], but the Native community with his advocacy and the [ORGANIZATION] Children's [PERSON] and the foster care. He's also helped [PERSON] where I work with our property at the campus and also with our affordable housing generation."
11_07_2018,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] has stepped forward to help. with community investments as well as microenterprise. We have [PERSON] and ORG2 that's addressing our many housing needs, which are very great in the Native community."
11_07_2018,homeless,We do have Native Americans who are overrepresented in the homeless population. We want to have a more direct partnership with the city to address those issues. We also want to break the cycle of poverty and provide good-paying jobs for our community.
11_07_2018,homeless,"We see a lot of them down on the streets [ORGANIZATION] as homeless, and they need the help bad. And if we continue to do this, I think it's one of our greatest things that can happen to our veterans [ORGANIZATION]. But they are really being recognized as heroes and warriors [ORGANIZATION].  that they should have been recognized and seen [LOCATION]."
11_07_2018,homelessness,Homelessness is not a game. It's not relevant. You're wasting everybody's time.
10_21_2015,affordable housing,"Since then, I managed to raise 85% of my project cost. My project goals were to provide affordable housing, utilization of [PERSON] workforce, and green development in [ORGANIZATION]. I asked for financial support of $1.5 million."
10_21_2015,affordable housing,"Well, if you're talking to [ORGANIZATION] in [PERSON]'s office, you're talking to the right person because [ORGANIZATION] sends all of its affordable housing funds to ORG1. So you're in the right [STREET] if you're in that conversation with her. Okay."
10_21_2015,homelessness,"You guys are talking about helping people facing homelessness in the apartment situation. Apartment rent owners raising 7%, 10%. So they just can't keep up with those rent high."
10_21_2015,homeless,"And you are also the rent [STREET]. And set a good example to those other people. So instead of...  We are losing our business, which is left to the homeless for us."
10_21_2015,homeless,"The wordage was really strange to me, talking about the benefits and the development of the community and life-threatening situations. And all I could think about the entire time was what we could do with that $195 million for the homeless community. We're putting maybe $2 million there, $5 million there for the homeless."
10_21_2015,homeless,"Oh, a state of emergency, let's put another couple million. The last time I attended one of these meetings that, for some reason, you think that most residents of [ORGANIZATION] can make it to, the money went straight into construction of a building that was right in my neighborhood that I've been evicted from and homeless for [ORGANIZATION]. And the rent there is $3,000 when I saw it on [ORGANIZATION]."
10_21_2015,homeless,"Okay. But I want you to pay attention to the homeless situation, what is really life-threatening with people losing their jobs and their houses, and why we would put money into this right now. Especially when it's a bit hypocritical with all the shoddy construction that's just everywhere now."
10_21_2015,homeless,"I would like to thank PERSON0 for his incredible devotion to this city and everything he has done. I was also particularly moved by PERSON1.  speech about allocating money for homeless resources. Just to tell you about my experience, [TIME] I slept in a box around FAC0 with newspapers about your emergency declaration."
10_21_2015,affordable housing,"And they kept me somewhat warm, and that's because I don't have affordable housing in this city. And I think this passionate need for jobs and housing are incredibly important, and  move towards equity in construction, and I'm very impressed with that. But I think when you decide to patch together something that's somewhat broken, you can run into a lot of problems."
11_18_2015,homeless,"Your advocacy. Okay, let's hear for the next citizen who signed up, [DATE]. Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding homeless people's rights and departitioned housing."
11_18_2015,homeless,"Maybe even, you know, encapsulate the bunk beds. with plywood for added security and or privacy, charged two, three hundred bucks a month, something even homeless people can afford. Physically, this is similar to a mission, but fundamentally it differs from a mission in the sense that people have the autonomy to come and go as they please, the ability to access back, take a shower when needed, no 5, [DATE], or [TIME] curfews for full-grown adults."
11_18_2015,homeless,"Some myths I would like to address are that people don't get along in situations like this. It's like I said last time I was here, when you allow a large body of homeless people to commute. congregate, it quickly becomes apparent that the peaceful outnumber the unpeaceful."
11_18_2015,homeless,"And it would restore people's autonomy. Secondly,  Not everybody needs their privacy, not at all points or times in their lives, especially homeless people who have become accustomed to this. But even if on a transitional scale, many people would go for this for a temporary amount of time."
11_18_2015,homeless; affordable housing,"It would clear out room for an already developed affordable housing unit. So rather than paying or subsidizing for every single homeless person to have their own [STREET], you could put something that's truly affordable on the market and make money off of the problem rather than throwing more and more money at it. Play around with the numbers."
11_18_2015,homeless,"This whole gentrification and homeless thing, it's not going to work out any differently than it did in any other town if we don't try something new. And missions, I'll say they work for many, but for many they're like prisons. You know, that's not living."
11_18_2015,houseless,"Thank you. Okay, item [DATE]. Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address [ORGANIZATION] regarding houseless issues."
11_18_2015,homeless,"This often involved pushing poor and homeless people out and raising property values, putting pressure on homeowners and residents. Many bids higher security and maintenance personnel to enforce these directives. They often wear distinctive uniforms or vests identifying them as ambassadors."
11_18_2015,homeless,"I would say that 99.9% of the homeless community would not call these people ambassadors. Just for the simple fact they are told to move along, move along, move along, move along. The reason why I say this as far as bids are concerned is with the city now saying that they are not going to sweep or criminalize homeless, the homeless people."
11_18_2015,homeless,"With the accountability and the non-transparency, the bid districts are able, are going to continue to criminalize the homeless people for their own interests. I don't see how that...  can be explained to the federal government when we have to, you know, go in and get grant money from them when they're asking, what are we going to do about criminalization? Thank you."
11_18_2015,homeless,"And ended with the caveat that we could all stick together and share the streets. And that's the grace in that piece, and that's why I read that poem. We're experiencing some grace in the homeless issue you've heard.  commentary [TIME] and relentlessly over [ORGANIZATION] and things are happening and it's really great to see."
11_18_2015,homeless,"So your willingness to try to squeeze this in with your other responsibilities is great. And I was particularly heartened looking at your background that you'd,  had some involvement with so-called [STREET] kids as well, because in addition to dealing with the sensitivities of mental illness or race or any of the other issues that have troubled the police bureau, our ability to work humanely with our homeless community is pretty important. So the fact that you've had that background, I think, is going to serve the community well."
11_18_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"So further discussion about that and then we – Yeah, I would like to – And I appreciate Commissioner [PERSON] coming by and visiting with me about this amendment [ORGANIZATION], and certainly contemplated it, but I was also struck [TIME] by an email I think we all received from two members of [ORGANIZATION], PERSON1 and PERSON2, who spoke against this amendment because they really feel that, you know, and I think we all feel this, there is an affordable housing crisis in this city right now."
11_18_2015,affordable housing,"We'll have a chance to make sure they're safer and they are built to code. I have my own anecdotal sense about what's happening with ADUs, and it's along the lines of the unintended consequences that we unleashed when we welcomed short-term rentals into our community. We've monetized spaces that actually, [ORGANIZATION], used to be available for affordable housing, and we have greatly contributed to the crisis in our community by giving people financial incentive to do short-term rentals over long-term rentals, and it isn't as if we had a lot of capacity to begin with."
11_18_2015,affordable housing,"and i converted it to a livable accessory dwelling unit sold for 117 000 in a neighborhood where everything else was about three times that um  With the proposed amendment, you couldn't do that anymore. It provided a form of affordable housing in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood, and even [ORGANIZATION] have passed, that unit has turned over once or twice, and it continues to be half to a third the cost of any other home in that neighborhood. For rentals, it's a little bit different scheme, but it's very similar."
11_18_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"They provide affordable housing options in neighborhoods that have very few choices. We really do have a housing crisis, and  We need to have little houses have to be part of the toolbox for that. And I want to share that [PERSON], and that's why I have this little handout for you, there's not much data out there about how ADUs are used."
11_18_2015,housing crisis,"But most ADUs are almost certainly used for long-term housing options. And we need those choices in a housing crisis. PERSON0, in fairness, we actually don't know the answer to that question."
11_18_2015,affordable housing,"You are not typical. The kinds of co-housing things you advocate for, the kinds of affordable housing options, all the things that you come before us are not typical of your peer group. And I say that as a compliment."
11_18_2015,affordable housing,"Almost 20% of them are rented for zero or like 500 bucks a month. And we need stuff like that. That's affordable housing, unsubsidized in any ongoing [STREET] by government, for small units where household sizes tend to be small."
11_18_2015,housing crisis,"We have neighborhoods that are at risk of becoming only affordable to millionaires, and these are sort of the kinds of housing we need more of in a housing crisis. PERSON0, we're not going to be taking up the [ORGANIZATION] issue [ORGANIZATION], but at some point I would love to have your thoughts about, as we're considering sunsetting the [ORGANIZATION] waiver, as to whether you think we should only sunset it on those units where the owner is willing to make the unit affordable. and is there some [STREET] to to to link those two well the other option there might be to have the ORG1 waiver uh you know we we've had trouble and PERSON1 and PERSON2 were explaining we had trouble in the past with regulations that were incenting people to do a workaround this is just an office it's not really a housing unit and and they were even carrying out sync agreements about whether or not you're installing a sink you know it got crazy and convoluted but"
11_18_2015,affordable housing,"Therefore, there's more flexibility in terms of being able to build ADUs that are cheaper because you don't have to do custom design for each and every unit. So the amendment is – the unintentional consequences are that it incentivizes 800 square foot ADUs, which means that –  more ADUs will cost more and will have to be used more for income-generating properties, whereas right now greater, 20 percent, potentially greater, are used for no-cost rental for family members, for friends. It's a form of organic affordable housing that doesn't require government subsidy other than the [ORGANIZATION] waiver, which I would love to see extended."
11_18_2015,affordable housing,"I don't think there's any stats that really back up what these  hypotheses are there's media and stories that have conflated [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] but the reality is a lot more being used for affordable housing and there's a lot of anecdotes to support that you just have to go digging for them and i and i as somebody who speaks with and deals with  Probably more AD owners than anybody else. I can tell you, you know, ORG2 is used in some cases, but it's definitely not the majority."
11_18_2015,affordable housing,"They are solutions for people for income generation. They are solutions for affordable housing. If we open up this model, we can create actually infill, not upfill, communities, people that walk by each other, engage, and actually engage with their neighbors."
11_18_2015,affordable housing,"But we buy and purchase land, and many of us, it is...  the only thing we have to call home. And if you have to stay at your home by allowing others to come in and support you by creating a basement unit, or you use the $40,000 on a [ORGANIZATION] to help convert the garage into something that helps generate income for the city and affordable housing, the reason [PERSON] is unique is because development of anything is difficult. And the ORG2 has been the option for the individual to create somewhat affordable development in [ORGANIZATION]."
11_18_2015,affordable housing,"We do not have a solution for it. There is no opportunity for affordable right now for most people, and the developers have not gotten on board. The issue is whether the affordable housing is placed within the setback."
11_18_2015,affordable housing,"It means that whenever I apply for a [STREET] to live, like [ORGANIZATION] when the investment firms bought my affordable housing and kicked us out and I had to go get a much more expensive [STREET], wherever I go to move, I have to write a letter. What I found was interesting in that, I want to do more research, was it seems as though the inner ring of [ORGANIZATION], actually all of those management companies have come together and said, we're not going to take...  felons no matter what. And then you go out further and further."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"New transit is critical to bringing better access to more housing, education, and job opportunities. That said, we know displacement risk from the rising cost of living and lack of affordable housing threatens the existing economic and cultural diversity in the corridor. That's already happening."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"We have [ORGANIZATION], the Executive Director of [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON] is the [LOCATION] and [PERSON] Director for [ORGANIZATION]. And with her is [ORGANIZATION], a ORG2 Tenant Leader."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"We need to work to determinately eliminate and specifically eliminate these disparities and create better outcomes for all the people in our communities. We have an opportunity right now, which doesn't come along very often, to undo a past history and do the right thing moving forward. We know that buying land,  for future affordable housing and purchasing existing apartments, buildings, other housing, naturally occurring affordable housing in those areas throughout the corridor and the preferred alternative will help preserve affordability and opportunity and should be our top priorities in this strategy."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"Great. Hi, I'm PERSON0. I'm an executive director at [ORGANIZATION]."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"And after doing work in [ORGANIZATION] and now really doing a lot of work in [PERSON], I feel like I understand that on a whole new level. So I just want to put that out there, too, that this is an amazing opportunity for us to look at a...  with a regional effort. [ORGANIZATION] starts with a senior property in GPE2."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"so I feel like I really have based on those two processes some good insight on the interconnection between transit and housing and in particular our focus which is affordable housing we know how important it is to be sure that folks who are currently  living along the corridor can benefit from this incredible upcoming public investment. At the same time, we know that we're expecting another 10,000 people along the corridor by [ORGANIZATION]. So with those things in mind, it just really, really speaks to the importance of having this strategy adopted."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"So I'm going to say kind of three things that I'm excited to ask about and want to thank you ahead of time for your leadership on these things. One is to be sure that we are tying up land now and prioritizing it for housing and in particular affordable housing. That's  As [ORGANIZATION] already mentioned, and as you know, this is our moment."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"I know that [ORGANIZATION] has set aside some urban renewal areas in the [ORGANIZATION] and downtown [ORGANIZATION] as well. And in the [ORGANIZATION] area have a set aside, a large set aside for affordable housing. And then fund the request from the community-based organizations active in the corridor to continue to engage low-income households."
10_04_2018,housing crisis,"I have a question for [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON], and you may have similar answers, so you don't have to do it in stereo, but I want to put the question out there. We have a housing crisis, and we're approaching it through housing,  Multiple strategies. The mayor has taken the unprecedented step of taking all development-related bureaus under his portfolio."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"So from the moment an idea is hatched to the ribbon-cutting, he has all the bureaus that touch that project, and he has said that he wants to see a streamlining of the permit process. He wants to see affordable housing go to the head of the line. He wants to see more concierge services."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"So I would just want to give each of you an opportunity to advise us as to whether, in thinking about an equitable housing strategy for [ORGANIZATION], which is a big deal, whether we should be compromising on those values. So if I –  So if I might, I'll start. Because as you know, I don't actually work in the affordable housing area, so I'm not actually going to address the affordable issue."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"Around this value proposition of opportunity, I think actually the case in point, what we were able to uncover with [ORGANIZATION] was that there's a lot of housing opportunity in apartment buildings that are currently people are renting from, in terms of they're called the naturally occurring affordable housing, and preserving those units, getting those buildings up to code and ensuring that folks have stable rents, as [ORGANIZATION] was saying,  These are family-sized units. The complex right next to the mosque on FAC0, they're three-bedroom units, right? These are actually apartments that families can continue to grow in and actually have multiple generations going to FAC1 across the [STREET]."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"And then we add that to the plan. Hopefully you'll like what you see and you'll be able to pass it. And with that adoption, we look forward to being able to do some core work around what I was talking about with the naturally occurring affordable housing preservation work."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"And those, Shannon will give a little more detail about, but they would roughly, between [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], double the amount of regulated affordable housing in the corridor to about 1,600 units. Now, the stretch targets that we created were designed in a totally different [STREET]. They were designed to achieve big policy goals."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"With careful planning, securing parcels for new development, and targeted efforts to prevent displacement and mitigate cultural displacement, the strategy aims to achieve equitable growth along the line. In [ORGANIZATION], we believe that [ORGANIZATION] has the means and the resources to achieve 300 to 350 new units of affordable housing along the corridor. To achieve the stretch targets will require additional resources."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], thank you. We as a city have unfortunately learned very hard lessons when we have failed to prioritize affordable housing and the prevention of displacement when we make our transportation infrastructure investments. The strategy is more than just acknowledging those mistakes, but we are actively taking steps and adding resources to realize this plan."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"We also need to ensure that we are maximizing the development potential for affordable housing along the corridor. With the announcement of the light rail line and its alignment, available land for sale becomes scarce, and the market begins to speculate. So securing land early, as you have heard, for future development is imperative."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"A key partner in the implementation of the strategy and the lead agency on the light rail line, [ORGANIZATION], has worked with ORG1 on a memorandum of understanding to ensure the availability of land to reach the goals in this strategy. We've had a series of extremely productive and collaborative discussions to reach the outlines of a Memorandum of Understanding, which will be presented to you with your action [ORGANIZATION] on the locally preferred alternative. I'd like to thank the entire team at [ORGANIZATION] for prioritizing these discussions, their shared commitment with ORG2 to prioritize affordable housing.  ensuring that families of all incomes can benefit from the fast, affordable transit service that will link these families to jobs and educational opportunities."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"They will offer excess property to [ORGANIZATION], enough to accommodate 600 to 700 new units of affordable housing. These sites will be sold at a discounted value, the equivalent of the federal portion of the appraised value, in accordance with federal transportation authority rules. And [ORGANIZATION] will, in collaboration with ORG2, look to maximize development potential adjacent to other light rail lines as well as [ORGANIZATION]."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"And you've heard a lot about the critical importance of preserving and increasing affordable housing for residents along [ORGANIZATION]. And as Commissioner [PERSON] mentioned, we're also mindful of the potential impacts on small local businesses. So as you'll see from this slide, we estimate that there are almost 1,000 businesses located within a quarter mile of the corridor whose employees and access to customers stand to benefit from proximity to the transit improvements."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] slide, please. Thank you. One of those funding sources that would provide tools for both affordable housing and affordable commercial space is tax increment finance."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"With a set-aside policy of 45% for affordable housing, the larger district as modeled would yield approximately $54 million for [ORGANIZATION] for their investments, which could fund an estimated 240 affordable housing units. These could also provide resources. The remaining $66 million could also provide resources through ORG1 to provide business loans and grants and investments in affordable commercial space, and it could also help support the local match for the light rail line itself."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"So it's important to not only talk about the affordable housing, but also the market rate targets we have and the growth management aspect of this. On the publicly owned properties, we've identified a number of them that already are in public ownership that could have a potential for redevelopment on the line, and we're exploring scenarios on those sites. One, FAC0, we understand that both [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] jointly own some land that is under that current highway infrastructure."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"Also at FAC0, if FAC1 has a light rail station that causes redevelopment of that site, there's the potential if we went vertical with that to put a couple hundred additional units there. [ORGANIZATION] is interested in development of affordable housing on the [ORGANIZATION] campus, a short walk from the FAC2 station. The transit improvements make it possible for them to consider reallocating land from parking into more intensive uses."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] acknowledged the strategy in [ORGANIZATION] as a toolbox of potential tools to address the need for more affordable housing. Even before the strategy was complete, [ORGANIZATION] has been taking action. In [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION] voters approved an urban rental district, and [ORGANIZATION] voters have to approve it."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], which is planned to have two southwest corridor light rail stations,  Our first allocation of [ORGANIZATION] money in that district was to support an affordable housing, community partner for affordable housing project that [ORGANIZATION] mentioned earlier that should be breaking ground in [ORGANIZATION]. Also in this area known as [PERSON], we've done a rezone with very streamlined development code. Actually, no parking minimums are required in this area."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"Okay. We're also kicking off a metro-funded project to figure out how we can implement this urban renewal district in an equitable manner. Other things, as was mentioned earlier, in [ORGANIZATION] our city council approved a local SDC exemption for regulated affordable housing for 80% [ORGANIZATION] and below."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"And what do you estimate is the need in the city of [ORGANIZATION] for affordable housing defined as below 80% of [ORGANIZATION]? Well, the strategy, you know, we have a goal of 600 to 800 units, but the need is higher than that, we realize. So our goal is to get 600 to 800 units.  built in [ORGANIZATION], but the need is greater than that."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,One of our last pieces of vacant land is actually under construction to build 240 units of affordable housing in partnership with [ORGANIZATION]. Thank you very much. I'm PERSON0 from [ORGANIZATION].
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"We recognize that affordable housing is both a city and a regional-wide priority. We need to work creatively and aggressively to address that. And [ORGANIZATION] is leaning into that hard, and we're willing to move forward with that."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"And we show that through a couple different methods. One is the Memorandum of Agreement on Affordable Housing. So as [ORGANIZATION] purchases property,  for the project where we have to stage property."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"When we're done with the project, we look to dispose of that property. And so through the agreement that we've reached with [ORGANIZATION] in principle, and it's an agreement that we have both with [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], and [ORGANIZATION] to do affordable housing on remnant parcels that are left over by the project. And this...  essentially outlines what [ORGANIZATION] talked about before."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"We're committing up to 600 to 700, locating and identifying 600 to 700 locations for 600 to 700 affordable housing units along the alignment. We're looking to write down the value of that to the degree that we are allowed to by law, federal law, returning that federal share back to [ORGANIZATION], who's the principal contractor. principal funder of it."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"So this is extending what we're doing now.  to what we will be doing hopefully in the future when we build the [ORGANIZATION] line and I think that also builds on our low income transit our low income fare so getting people to and from work in a more effective [STREET] really improves both that access and where people can live so [ORGANIZATION] really feels like it's part of the solution  Now, [ORGANIZATION] and this region, [ORGANIZATION] has been one of the showcases around the country and internationally of how you build light rail. I think this is the next new model of how you build light rail with affordable housing at the same time."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"So I'm very concerned that if we have too much...  only focus on affordable housing, we end up making that less livable because we don't have the services that go with it or the jobs that go with businesses. So if I can just take [TIME] to talk to you about one of the pilot projects is with [ORGANIZATION]. And they have a program that they're actively working on in [ORGANIZATION]."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"Improved transportation service is only effective if the benefits are not offset by rising housing costs. That's why it's so important that we have developed the equitable housing strategy and why we need to make sure that we deliver on it. Before adopting the locally preferred alternative, we need to be certain that the affordable housing is guaranteed as part of this project."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"As [ORGANIZATION] Commissioner, I've directed [PERSON] to complete assigned [ORGANIZATION] with ORG2 ahead of [ORGANIZATION] vote that commits the parties to the acquisition and development of property expressly for affordable housing along the proposed FAC0  light rail line and again that is from Commissioner you [PERSON]. All right Thank you for our jurisdictional partners for coming DATE2. I really appreciate you"
10_04_2018,housing crisis,"Under [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] expresses our cautious optimism and support for the proposed [LOCATION], and I'll talk to you about it. little bit of our hesitancy as we why that is the strategy is well researched and designed to address the near-term housing crisis and the long-term housing needs in the corridor in terms of prevention of displacement and gentrification of low-income and  people of color."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"to make that funding, to make an ongoing [ORGANIZATION] investment above the current levels into the anti-displacement services, make a one-time multimillion-dollar investment into the general funds of an apartment building acquisition fund. These are all things that are in the plan. um, for my [ORGANIZATION] with a strong, with strong guardrails against funds being used for anything other than affordable housing until the housing strategy has been fully implemented and the targets met, and follow through on developing proposals and funding for new tenant protections."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"Their job [ORGANIZATION] is to capitalize the early investments that are made now to keep the affordable housing in the affordable housing portfolio. And so it's not only what you're going to do early on, but are we going to long-term make those investments that hold that portfolio together? And so..."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"And the other significant thing is [ORGANIZATION], and you heard [ORGANIZATION] say it, they're leaning in around affordable housing. That's significant. I mean, [ORGANIZATION] has one goal, build a train, get people on it, let's get going."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"And they get it. They're saying, hey, we need affordable housing to be a successful agency. And so you have partners...  It's not just the city of [ORGANIZATION]."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"And so I guess I can't promise to you that, yes, I will do what [ORGANIZATION] suggested, because it's always going to be what's available and what's the most crucial [STREET] to invest it. And also, I do think we need to invest in this, because unlike the orange line that I was on the council for, where we knew this was coming, and we didn't do what's called for here, and lo and behold, we again have displacements and lack of affordable housing. So let's learn from that."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"Some of that naturally occurring affordable housing along the,  the [ORGANIZATION] corridor, if you travel it very often like I have for [ORGANIZATION], you'll know that they're some of the biggest contributors to some of the stormwater problems we have along there. Some of the maintenance that hasn't been done on those buildings has been on their storm drainage systems, and it contributes to the problems we're dealing with in that area. Thank you."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"And I hope to be on this council for a long time and long enough so that we can celebrate some wins of doing things differently and really getting this transportation and affordable housing nexus right. Because as was earlier noted, the principal cost that households are now incurring is a rent plus transportation cost. And...  I'm encouraged by the work that's been done, and I look forward to future presentations."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"I know a lot of effort went into bringing this forward together, and I look forward to seeing the final agreement between the city and [ORGANIZATION]. While [ORGANIZATION] and our partners work very diligently to prevent displacement, together we make sure that we're building the affordable housing and the commercial space to help [ORGANIZATION]ers thrive. And last but not least, I just want to say that this is a very important initiative because it intentionally brings the transportation and the workforce and affordable housing piece together."
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"And as Commissioner [PERSON] noted, there are also issues on the [ORGANIZATION] ballot that can help further this process. And I would encourage people as they look at their ballots to do so very carefully with the intention of supporting any measure that could help us move forward with this affordable housing, frankly, obligation. So thank you all."
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"So my point [TIME] is, look, we screwed up the [ORGANIZATION] plan because it wasn't working. And you constantly, constantly say,  rely on affordable housing that has nothing to do with people on the [STREET]. Let me say that again."
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"I'm a retired civil servant, so I can do that. People are hanging by their fingertips. And would you please understand that affordable housing is not low-income housing."
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"It means that...  There's a percentage of your rates, 25% the federal government talks about, about your mortgage or your rent. That's what you should be paying. That's affordable housing."
10_14_2015,houseless,"Item [DATE], please. Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel regarding Right to Dream 2, houseless issues. Good morning."
10_14_2015,homeless,"Hello and good morning, everyone. My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I've been homeless now for [ORGANIZATION] and I'm originally from [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], but I've also lived in [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and [PERSON]."
10_14_2015,homeless,"I'm here to be a homeless advocate and talk about how I feel about the sweeps, which, as you all should know, is criminal. [ORGANIZATION] made sure to sweep everyone on that whole block during [LOCATION], where [LOCATION] was going on, right before it let people in. Why?"
10_14_2015,homeless,"So [PERSON] and the FAC0  people and the other people and others and yeah, could make money. DATE0 in [TIME], I see [ORGANIZATION] concerned waking up the homeless people and bothering them and just to clear the streets. I feel that if people, if anybody, if people are hungry and naked and sad,  and, you know, poor and homeless, we should help them and not hurt them."
10_14_2015,houseless,"Thanks very much. Okay, let's take [DATE], please. A request of [ORGANIZATION] to address [ORGANIZATION] regarding houseless issues."
10_14_2015,homeless; houseless,"There's a couple of issues that, you know, basically the federal government has weighed in on as far as, you know, how houseless people are criminalized. One was the house or the...  [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] has asked for municipalities to, if they want to continue their continuum of care money that they're getting from the federal government, that they would have to explain to the federal government how they planned to deal with the criminalization of homeless people. PERSON0, my question to you is, how would you answer that question?"
10_14_2015,homeless,"In the case, I think it was [ORGANIZATION] versus the city of [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], where I believe a bunch of homeless people brought suit to the city and it went to [ORGANIZATION] or some higher [STREET]. They have this letter of interest is by no means binding for any municipality, but what it does do is it makes clearer the framework where this can be challenged in a higher [STREET] for the criminalization of homeless people. In closing, I would like to also cite one other thing, and I can't remember right off the top of my head what the [STREET] case was that [ORGANIZATION] issued.  used in framing their letter of interest."
10_14_2015,homeless; affordable housing; houseless,"It was a [STREET] case that I believe it was in [ORGANIZATION] that the question was raised, how do you criminalize the behavior and not criminalize status? And what I mean by that is if a homeless person is breaking the law, how can you not criminalize the status of,  of breaking that law, where another person that's not housed or that has a house could break the same law and not be criminalized on their status. And I'd like you guys to ponder that question a little bit because I do believe that criminalizing the houseless community is not only the wrong thing to do,  It's the most expensive thing we're doing, that where if you can save that money from the criminalization and putting them in housing, we could, you know, maybe come up with another funding source for affordable housing."
10_14_2015,homeless,"We don't have a pure answer for you, and I don't have an answer for you DATE0 about what we're going to do with people who are homeless, who are ready to be discharged and have nowhere else to go. But one of the – we have over 20 work groups who are really working at various and sundry aspects of [ORGANIZATION] is how we're developing it and how we're going to be setting it up. One of those 20 work groups is a transitions work group."
10_14_2015,affordable housing,I don't want Senator [PERSON] to break out in hives. We're not talking about general fund resources. We're talking about the equivalent in this discussion of the residual reserves that we tapped in our preservation agenda where there was an abundance of funds in a reserve that [ORGANIZATION] controlled.  that we liberated to do affordable housing.
10_14_2015,homeless,"And in exchange, we have to provide them with a copy of our [ORGANIZATION] work plan and commit to do the work in the plan, which is aligned with our strategic plan. And what's the federal bucket that it's coming from? It comes, it's a pass-through grant from [ORGANIZATION]  so is that likely to continue at infinitum we hope that that's the case but of of course it's dependent on the federal budget sequestration it's homeless if it's homeland security then it probably will thank you okay any other questions for [ORGANIZATION] thank you very much anyone want to speak on this item if not it's an emergency ordinance take a vote please thank you [ORGANIZATION]"
10_14_2015,affordable housing,[DATE]. Amend Affordable Housing Preservation Code to add [ORGANIZATION] renter protections. Further discussion before we vote?
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"And I know we've all heard, we heard in this chamber from people that are,  so passionately fearful about their situation in our city, whether they're trying to buy a house and they're seeing the houses on the block transformed or demolished and replaced, a subject that we'll get to here shortly, whether they're trying to stay in their rental unit and are fearful of a letter in the mailbox that says their rent's going up 40%, as we heard in at least some cases has happened. So we have to try some new things, and this is a new thing for [ORGANIZATION] to do. It's appropriate that in a state of emergency we try some things, and then we evaluate, as you just said, [ORGANIZATION] or [LOCATION], because the [ORGANIZATION] term of this state of emergency seems about right if we're going to focus a lot of attention on,  If you've been in this chamber during these discussions, you'll have heard [PERSON] how your housing bureau is issuing the largest ever notice of funds availability for the construction of affordable housing."
10_14_2015,homeless,"Yes. DATE0 during the homeless [STREET] count,  We found that the representation of African Americans in the unsheltered adult population had grown by 48 percent in [LOCATION]. In order to address the racial disparities in the system, we needed to focus on reaching community members in crisis in places they already frequented."
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"My hope is that the effect of this tax will be, if it's adopted by the council in some form after [ORGANIZATION]'s hearing and more discussion and further refinement, My hope is that this will cut the rate of demolition of serviceable houses in half and produce a couple million dollars a year for affordable housing for our fellow citizens who'd like to be able to buy one. That's the goal, at least my goal, and it's open to discussion because this is an innovation about whether this particular tool is a good idea at all, whether we've got it right in its current draft, or whether some different approach would get to that result."
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"One of them is for affordable housing. There are, there's a directive within the code that would require [ORGANIZATION] to set up some guidelines following the pattern that's already established in Chapter 30 regarding exemptions for system development charges. And also, the other rebate is for increased density, and [ORGANIZATION] would develop some guidelines about what that looks like, but typically it's an increase in the number of dwelling units on a particular parcel."
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"With that, I'll turn it back to [ORGANIZATION]. On the definition page, so just to be clear, the affordable housing rebate that you're proposing just tracks the [ORGANIZATION] exemption program, same criteria? Guidelines based on that program, yes."
10_14_2015,affordable housing,We would look to housing as having that expertise. But it's the same formula that we use for [ORGANIZATION] exemption for affordable housing? Yes.
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"So we can't exempt them from the tax, but we can rebate them. So the affordable housing provider would have to put up the $25,000 and get it back later? That's correct."
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"You know, with this PITS affordability and resources for affordable housing programs against accommodating increased growth that we know is coming, this tries to strike a balance. That's a policy choice for the council to take, whether we want this to apply to only 36 percent of demolitions or if the primary purpose is to raise money for affordable housing, whether we want it to apply elsewhere. Correct."
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"I want public testimony on that as well as on the rest of the matter. Mayor, I have a correction to a statement I made earlier. Commissioner [PERSON], you asked about affordable housing and how the tax would apply to that."
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"Actually, the financial hardship would only apply if they were appealing a penalty assessment. So at this point, the ordinance would require anyone putting up affordable housing to pay the tax up front and then request the rebate after the fact. I just want to get clear on that."
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"In addition, the damage done to neighborhood fabric and the impacts on people living adjacent to these demolitions and construction projects, demolitions have destroyed many viable, affordable homes and apartments in [ORGANIZATION] at a time when affordable housing is becoming increasingly hard to find. The money collected from this proposed demolition tax would go into a fund to address affordable housing issue. We believe it's only fair that the beneficiaries of the boom, the developers, should help pay for some of the negative externalities of their actions."
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"Although [ORGANIZATION] agrees that a demolition tax could help curb demolitions and raise money for affordable housing, we do not believe the proposed tax structure we're talking about [ORGANIZATION] will achieve that goal. The next speakers will tell you why we don't believe the proposed tax will work and what we submit as a revised tax for you to consider. Thank you for listening to us."
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"We respectfully submit a revised version that [ORGANIZATION] handed out. It's already in code language. The simple structure of [ORGANIZATION]'s revised tax, $35,000 flat tax on both demolitions and major remodels, will achieve the aim of protecting affordable housing and amassing funding for more."
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"The affordable housing, mature urban trees, character and history, and uncontaminated dirt and air, among other irreplaceable assets of our community. This is your third try at curbing demolitions. Please make it matter."
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"Commissioner [PERSON], you care about waste and resource waste and climate change. There's no [STREET] you can recoup the carbon cost of throwing an old growth home in the dumpster. And Commissioner [PERSON], if you care about affordable housing and aging in [STREET], these are homes that served generations of Portlanders and could have served many more."
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"It was surgically removed when I was an executive at the power company. Very painful. If we're really talking about affordable housing, one of my staff proposed [ORGANIZATION] to me that it was very simple."
10_14_2015,homeless,"Two-thirds of all of the FAC0 are now not licensed, and therefore we have an enormous housing stock pretty much taken out of the normal use. And that would be an excellent [STREET] for a voucher system for the homeless [ORGANIZATION]. May I ask a question?"
10_14_2015,homeless,"But please have the staffer who has that tell us, because it's very different than what we've seen. The second thing, I think the situation is worse. But it's okay to put a homeless in a permit at [ORGANIZATION]."
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"I don't see it as a – I think the revenue production will be the revenue savings that people will have because there's – and I like to use a term [ORGANIZATION] taught me this term, affordability as opposed to affordable housing. So we need to make affordability part of our language. Okay."
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"The four partial rebates that I'd like the council to consider [ORGANIZATION] would be rebates for full deconstruction. And in doing full deconstruction, we would solve for the hazardous materials concerns that neighbors have. Two, a rebate for affordable housing."
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"Affordable housing could be one. And for those projects that are on transit corridors or in multifamily zones, you could accommodate some of the concerns about density through having that type of rebate. Can I just ask you why?"
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"While I think we can all agree that [ORGANIZATION], like most [ORGANIZATION] cities and really a lot of different areas throughout the country, has an affordable housing issue, I believe the proposed demolition tax is a solution that is looking for a problem. and it doesn't necessarily address affordability here in [ORGANIZATION] at all. Let me kind of share with you some numbers as to why I believe this."
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"Thank you. I to I'm [ORGANIZATION] executive director of [ORGANIZATION] and And I, too, applaud really all of your efforts [ORGANIZATION] toward creating more opportunities for affordable housing and the production of affordable housing."
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"If the issue is demolitions, that's just going to promote it. We would welcome the idea if you were going to exempt the two-for-one that that only occur if it's for affordable housing. We really liked the idea in the original plan of the instead of the flat fee was it the older the house, the more you paid because that's an incentive for preservation."
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"Now, since that letter to the editor appeared in the [ORGANIZATION], there's this idea of rebates came up.  and property owners could collect rebates for building multiple units or affordable housing and various other categories. Unfortunately, the rebate would be granted to a developer who is going to replace a one structure and replace with two larger, more expensive [ORGANIZATION]. Thus, no disincentive for the current destruction there be."
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"so we need to be focusing on possibly more the urban growth boundary number one to get more land so these developers aren't scrambling and trying to do more projects on very limited property or again talking affordable housing which i mentioned to commissioner [ORGANIZATION]  Let's start talking about an affordable housing bond again, such as they did in [ORGANIZATION] with Mayor [PERSON]. And let's start doing things that are a little bit more productive instead of trying to stall the developers from building more housing when we know we have a housing shortage. And if you want to buy the house before they get to it, we'll buy it."
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"And we are pleased to see this policy coming before you for your consideration. And we've supported this concept from the beginning. We appreciate your work, Mayor, and your staff's work to look for new tools to help fund affordable housing and to mitigate the affordability crisis in our community."
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"and it is only one step in addressing the problem of demolitions also. So let this not be the end of your work on demolitions, and let this just be the beginning of your work on new affordable housing funding tools, because we have much further to go. Thank you."
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"I would agree more with you on our [DATE] is a more realistic number to [DATE],000 to curb demolition. It may not be the ultimate number, but it's a good start. I also feel that getting rebates for a two-to-one demolitions and rebuilding will probably only  add fuel to the fire of demolitions in [ORGANIZATION], and we'll be losing even more of our affordable housing."
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"However you want to define affordable housing, I think we'd have to admit that the house that goes down is more affordable than the one that's one or two that get rebuilt. I also want to say just quickly that I've heard comment here about we should be tearing houses down and replacing them with more energy-efficient housing because it's better for the environment. But actually, that is really a very pennywise and pound-for-[PERSON] thing to do with the environment."
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"I would like to address the two issues that you're trying to deal with. One is the preservation of the neighborhood character, and the other is the increase in affordable housing. I oppose this tax because I don't think it does either."
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"If you have enough money to tear a house down, the extra $25,000 is not going to be a main issue. And if it's increased, you're not going to get any money for affordable housing because you won't collect any. There's other unintended consequences."
10_14_2015,affordable housing,So there's a positive [STREET] of getting more affordable housing without affecting the architectural character of the neighborhood. So thank you. Thank you.
10_14_2015,homelessness; housing crisis,"We're going to have to try a lot of things to address the housing crisis that we have in our city, both the affordability crisis, the preservation crisis, and the homelessness crisis. And some of those things will be things that other cities have tried. and we can borrow good ideas from them, and I'm looking forward to the discussion of housing and homelessness with my colleagues, the large city [ORGANIZATION] mayors, when they meet here in [ORGANIZATION]."
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"So then rich people who are buying up houses here would be contributed to affordable housing. Unfortunately, we can't do that because the voters of the state passed a prohibition on real estate transfer taxes. But that's really what I would like."
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"So to that extent, we may be able to provide some assistance for affordable housing without raising house prices significantly. as a whole, if you're putting those $25,000 or $35,000 on a home that's $200,000, $300,000, $400,000, then you probably are going to be raising the price of that home. I appreciated the developer who said that they are going to pass on the cost either to the seller or to the buyer."
11_02_2016,homeless,"So you do a good job. Thank you. But...  I actually gave everybody a handout, too, for an alternative for homeless people."
11_02_2016,affordable housing,"Yes, my name is [ORGANIZATION]. I represent [ORGANIZATION] Watchdog PDX. pertaining to the affordable housing bond measure [DATE] like i say my position is a yes vote on that one of the concerns i will state is that when the discussions on the bond number one when certain properties currently out there are being purchased i would like the since there will be no debt on these properties i would like the property taxes still to be paid  Now, the reason why I say that, let's just say, use [ORGANIZATION] as an example."
11_02_2016,homeless,"What's the community going to do in terms of...  fundraising and support for people that have been made homeless, for people that have lost their jobs, and for small businesses that are struggling to get going again. So I think there's a lot of questions about the near term, [ORGANIZATION], say, and then there's [LOCATION] or two, while there's going to be a lot of construction and reconstruction in a very walkable pedestrian district that's going to be difficult to manage as well. So just a quick update."
11_02_2016,homeless,"And that's why every time you get someone off the [STREET], somebody else bounces on the [STREET]. So you have to deal with the $15,000 figure, not the $4,000, not the $2,000, not some idiot that goes out there and says, One, two, three, four. Oh, you don't look homeless."
11_02_2016,homeless,"I've actually – I was homeless [ORGANIZATION], and I've actually done –  feeding at [ORGANIZATION], you know, and I've done those sort of things. I would have very much loved to have helped FAC0 if it was to be permanent, but it wasn't headed in that direction. I wish to say this."
11_02_2016,homeless,"I may in the future get involved with [ORGANIZATION] and support camping under bridges and support some sort of state program  There's a thing called the Homeless Bill of Rights, which could be invoked to allow people to camp there. But I would like police to actually not tear down tents, but actually make sure they're clean, help coordinate cleanups. I think it's not so bad that people are sleeping under bridges and stuff."
11_02_2016,homeless; homelessness,"There are always serious problems with using this site as the site of a long-term [INSTITUTION] or campus, the primary one that we just discussed, which is that it is zoned industrial. I voted to allow the private parties interested in using this as a shelter space to see if they could pull together a viable proposal to shelter folks [ORGANIZATION], partly because we need additional shelter space and [LOCATION] is upon us, but also because  I was very impressed that these private parties were stepping forward and saying they were willing to devote private resources to help us deal with the community issue of homelessness. I recently went with the mayor-elect to [ORGANIZATION] to see their [ORGANIZATION] model."
11_02_2016,homeless,"And I've been very impressed over [ORGANIZATION] to see the [ORGANIZATION] family step forward and offer their property to be used as a temporary [INSTITUTION], to see [PERSON] do exactly the same thing in [LOCATION]. And I'm very much appreciative of [LOCATION] and the many others we had prepared to invest in this proposal, like [ORGANIZATION] and PERSON4 and PERSON5. I really applaud their efforts and support."
11_02_2016,homeless,"I agree with [ORGANIZATION], President of [ORGANIZATION], who recently said that [PERSON] has, quote, performed a phenomenal service to the city as he moved the conversation forward. So I really hope that Mr. [PERSON], Mr. [PERSON], Mr. [PERSON], Mr. [PERSON], and all the others who are prepared to make this kind of investment are not discouraged and will continue their commitment to assist with the homeless problem. So that being said, we obviously are not going to be able to use FAC0 as a temporary shelter DATE0."
11_02_2016,homelessness,"So thank you for doing that. I need to correct the record because we just got yelled at for doing nothing whatsoever on housing and homelessness. And, Mayor, I hope in your comments you'll correct."
11_02_2016,homeless,"recap for the past four budgets, how much we have allocated to those services. I want to remind us all, we all unanimously adopted the [ORGANIZATION] plan. We all said that we're going to have a joint office of homeless services managed by [ORGANIZATION] in the county."
11_02_2016,homeless; affordable housing,"Although Right to Dream 2 is mentioned in the [ORGANIZATION] plan, it's not a core part of what  what the strategy is to get people permanent affordable housing and to prevent people from becoming homeless in the first [STREET], which is by far the cheapest [STREET] of doing things. So thank you all. I know that we all care about this, despite being yelled at for not caring."
11_02_2016,housing crisis,"But while we had a disagreement about a piece of dirt, we never had a disagreement about our collective respect and gratitude for the fact that a private developer stepped forward and said, how can I help? And I'm going to join with all my colleagues in saying that while in taking this action, we are going back to a decision that was made [ORGANIZATION],  We should not miss an opportunity to applaud [ORGANIZATION] and his partners for offering to help, and we should encourage this mayor and the next mayor to bring them into the broader conversation about how we can address this housing crisis. They have a lot to bring to the table beyond simply private resources, and we should be grateful for their willingness to do so."
11_02_2016,homeless,"We had an honest disagreement about [ORGANIZATION], but we never let it get in the [STREET] of our shared commitment to addressing this housing and homeless crisis. So DATE0 I'm pleased to vote aye. PERSON0?"
11_02_2016,homeless,"Aye. Well, I want to thank [ORGANIZATION] and his partners in the [ORGANIZATION] model, or [PERSON] as they were calling it here, for thinking big. You know, for thinking sort of [ORGANIZATION]-sized big about addressing the tremendous needs we have for shelter and services for people who are homeless in our city."
11_02_2016,affordable housing,"And I think that...  I think we all recognize that we need the private sector. We need to marshal the forces of the private sector if we're ever going to really, truly provide not only enough affordable housing that we need, but also enough shelter space. And I think one of the beauties of [ORGANIZATION] or [ORGANIZATION] is the co-location of all the different service providers."
11_02_2016,homelessness,"So be it. It is important, as Commissioner [PERSON] noted, to remember the larger context of what we're doing here, which is we declared a state of housing emergency. We have put more general fund dollars into housing and homelessness in [ORGANIZATION] than in [LOCATION] combined before that."
11_02_2016,affordable housing,"We've also changed our percentage of urban renewal funds dedicated to affordable housing.  to yield another $200-plus million of investment in affordable housing. And, again, thanks to your leadership, [ORGANIZATION], I believe the largest bond measure in the history of the city, not just the largest bond measure for housing, or I think it's the largest bond measure for anything, is on the ballot [ORGANIZATION], and I hope and expect that [ORGANIZATION] are going to think  about our future and approve that bond measure. I certainly voted for it, and I think everybody here did as well."
11_02_2016,homeless,"So we are making a huge investment as partners in this [ORGANIZATION] consortium, and we're going to meet or exceed our goal of opening 650 more shelter beds [ORGANIZATION] in a city that hadn't opened any new shelter beds in a very long time because we're going to open another 150 in [LOCATION] in [ORGANIZATION]. So, the progress that we're making is substantial. Some people allege that there are more homeless people in [PERSON] than there used to be."
11_02_2016,homeless,"We'll find out in [ORGANIZATION] when the count is conducted. It may be the case that there are less places where they're inconspicuous and a city that is welcoming 1,000 more people a month and where the forgotten corners are growing new buildings. So it may not be numerically that we have more homeless people, but we are far from solving the problem."
11_02_2016,affordable housing,"No question about that. And what we're doing in terms of building more shelter beds, building more affordable housing, partnering with the county, partnering with [ORGANIZATION] and other public and private organizations, those are all the right ingredients. And every time I talk to another major city mayor,  They send somebody here to learn from us."
11_02_2016,homelessness,"It is a better idea. And, in fact, that's exactly the program at FAC0, and that's going to be the program at [ORGANIZATION] as well, where we have services there to help people out of homelessness. DATE0, I was celebrating with ORG1 in ORG2 an amazing gift from [ORGANIZATION] foundation of $300,[ADDRESS] are going to move from building beautiful furniture to building tiny homes."
11_02_2016,homeless,"We currently have an item in our code that allows a religious institution to host one transitional housing unit for [ORGANIZATION], but  What we found is, and I think the original intent of this was either to host a homeless family or potentially host a refugee family or somebody who has recently moved to the area. What many of our providers have found is that [PERSON] is often not enough time to find secure housing for that group. There was also a desire with some institutions to expand the number of households they could host."
11_02_2016,affordable housing,The [ORGANIZATION] city council resolution never actually changed the code. One thing that [ORGANIZATION] did not do was they did look at a staff proposal to reduce the type of review for affordable housing projects that met certain housing bureau conditions. There's currently a temporary ordinance that was instituted in [LOCATION] to allow those to go through a type 2X review instead of a type 3.
11_02_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"Well, just to add to that quickly, even in [ORGANIZATION], affordable housing projects that did come in tactically when they did their evaluation chose to do a Type 3, so you had a choice, so they weren't sure of the benefits, but they understood the intent. Thank you. So I just wanted to mention, you know, the [ORGANIZATION] recognized that these code changes were not the silver bullet to solve homelessness."
11_02_2016,affordable housing,"There are actually a lot of projects that the city is undergoing currently that together will definitely help the situation, but this is just one aspect of it. There are, of course, other... [ORGANIZATION], which you'll be hearing in the future, is another example of finding ways to deal with affordable housing."
11_02_2016,affordable housing,"And then, of course, [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] is also looking at provisions related to affordable housing. So this is not, of course, the only bite at the apple. But we did feel that this was something that did address the heart of the matter as far as what the council had asked in terms of finding zoning code situations that help with the process and the regulations, especially for short-term housing and mass shelters."
11_02_2016,homeless,"Good [TIME], Mayor, Commissioners. My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I work with [LOCATION] [ORGANIZATION]."
11_02_2016,homeless; homelessness; affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] was formed to coordinate budgeting, contracting, and policy development roles of the city and county related to ending homelessness. Staff from [ORGANIZATION] also coordinate ORG2, our community-wide effort to house people experiencing homelessness throughout [ORGANIZATION] by making smart investments in the areas of housing, income, health, and importantly [ORGANIZATION], survival and emergency services. One of the early priorities identified by [ORGANIZATION] work group was to remove barriers to siting shelters,  and other safety off the streets options for people experiencing homelessness, while we worked diligently toward long-term solutions to homelessness, like expansion of permanently affordable housing."
11_02_2016,homeless,"Under the housing state of emergency and working with [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] has opened three temporary shelters in [ORGANIZATION]. We will open two more [LOCATION]. It is highly unlikely we would have been able to open even one additional shelter without the flexibility provided to us by the state of emergency requirements."
11_02_2016,housing crisis,"I am PERSON0 from [ORGANIZATION], and I just want to share my experience of having gone through a conditional use review before the housing crisis was official. It was a very long and expensive and difficult process. and particularly the transportation piece."
11_02_2016,homeless,"Thank you for inviting me. [ORGANIZATION], director of [ORGANIZATION]. We serve homeless veterans in the greater [ORGANIZATION] area."
11_02_2016,homeless,"And in [ORGANIZATION], we have partnered with religious institutions to open two new shelters to serve homeless veterans. And again, without the state of the emergency, we believe that this would have been quite a daunting and difficult task. In [ORGANIZATION], we've been able to serve over 175 veterans."
11_02_2016,housing crisis; unhoused,"Thank you. [ORGANIZATION]'s housing crisis, and in particular the 4,000 unhoused [ORGANIZATION]ers on our streets [TIME], demand action. [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] City Council made a historic stride towards taking action proportional to the challenge when it declared a housing state emergency."
11_02_2016,affordable housing,Strong implementation of the anti-displacement goals and policies recently adopted into the comprehensive plan update. Ability to leverage fees appropriately on new development. Bond measures to raise funds for permanently affordable housing.
11_02_2016,houseless,"On [ORGANIZATION], in the rain at FAC0 in northwest [ORGANIZATION], 54 volunteers began work on four 8x8 shelter pods to be donated for use by [ORGANIZATION]'s houseless community. After [PERSON] of hard work, they were transported to the rebuilding center to be completed. One of the pods has been donated to the new [ORGANIZATION] created by ORG1 and will be sited there DATE2."
11_02_2016,homeless,"The pod is homeless at the moment, hopefully. We can do something about that. Our group has been thrilled with the response from business community, [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, and especially want to point out the amazing support and participation of [ORGANIZATION]."
11_02_2016,homeless; homelessness,"somewhere we as a community so maybe there's 31 homeless pods at the moment so soon there'll be more we have other folks signed up i show one more person [ORGANIZATION] and anyone else that'd like to speak on this item come on up as well welcome thank you mayor commissioners [ORGANIZATION] i'm the director of homeless initiatives for [ORGANIZATION] In addition to ORG1 role providing housing and assistance to people leaving homelessness, our executive director sits on the executive committee for a home for everyone."
11_02_2016,homelessness,"And I'm here [ORGANIZATION] to briefly share ORG0 support for the proposed changes to the zoning code affecting mass shelter and short-term housing. While recognizing the scale of the crisis we face and without understanding the amount of work that remains, at [ORGANIZATION], we've been very encouraged by the impact to date of our coordinated and collaborative efforts through ORG2. We fully embrace our shared commitment through ORG2 to increase options for safety and a good night's sleep for people experiencing homelessness in our community, including through an expansion of our community's shelter options."
11_02_2016,homelessness,"We believe the changes being considered [ORGANIZATION] will facilitate our community's ability to achieve the goals established through [ORGANIZATION] and would ask you to adopt them. In particular, we believe the changes being considered are an important step forward for two reasons. First, there's an unprecedented awareness in our community of the housing and homelessness crisis we face, particularly when it comes to the people throughout our city experiencing unsheltered homelessness."
11_02_2016,homelessness,"It is our hope that this unprecedented awareness can translate into unprecedented engagement in addressing the problems our city faces. Making changes like this one, like the ones before you, we believe that limit barriers to solutions-focused engagement are incredibly important, and we hope will facilitate involvement of additional, perhaps less-resourced, private nonprofit and faith-based groups. And I'm encouraged by the additional conversation that's happened here [ORGANIZATION], that there's opening to continue to look at ways that we can, as jurisdictions and public agencies, be welcoming partners for folks who are looking to be engaged in our efforts to end homelessness."
11_02_2016,homeless,"Now, another issue on the 200 units, I think that's within reason. Again, some of these shelters I don't think can really operate over 100 efficiently. But when we look at the overall city itself operating efficiency, again,  for the city benefits all the people, not just the homeless, not just the business owners, not just people coming into town."
11_02_2016,homeless; homelessness,"So we need to keep focusing. The city that runs the most efficient takes care of the homeless the best, and it decreases homelessness throughout the city. And if we don't focus on running the city overall efficiently, then...  then we will have problems on having too many people in certain areas, which I think shouldn't be happening in [ORGANIZATION]'s city."
11_02_2016,homeless,"I really have questions about that because homeless people, when they're sleeping on sidewalks, are exposed to carbon dioxide fumes, monoxide fumes. Rain is toxic to a homeless person and invokes pneumonia. If you're sleeping on the grass in a park, they could have just put down pesticides."
11_02_2016,homeless,"Also, I always thought, too, at FAC0, they might have actually paid some of the people to help to clean up the toxic stuff under the concrete, and they might have learned something. So there could be ways to teach homeless people as an apprenticeship program how to clean up a toxic building as a job skill. But I'm just saying in the future, because of the exposure to chemicals,  You said you use a – there's what I call a non-background argument."
11_02_2016,homeless,"So if we have a 20,000-square-foot building that houses no homeless people [ORGANIZATION], but we're not expanding its building area, this doesn't come to bear? Well, it would have to already be a mass shelter. So this applies to existing mass shelters."
10_25_2017,homeless,"So I say to the city council, get some shovels, dudes. You guys open some emergency shelters for homeless people, and I think that's absolutely terrific. But you could have bought some shovels and gone to the homeless shelters and asked if anybody wanted to make $8 to $10 an hour and go out and shovel the sidewalks."
10_25_2017,unhoused,"Next one, please. Yes. Item [DATE], request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding the need for restrooms in southeast [ORGANIZATION] for our unhoused residents."
10_25_2017,homelessness; unhoused,"And I work for [ORGANIZATION], a local nonprofit that serves people experiencing homelessness. I have a master's in social work and have been working and providing direct service to unhoused folks in [ORGANIZATION] and outer southeast [PERSON] for [LOCATION]. My work has given me a deep understanding of issues that both our housed and unhoused residents face in southeast [PERSON]."
10_25_2017,unhoused,"Unlike in downtown, where restrooms can be found at the waterfront or along the park blocks, no such bathrooms exist in southeast, to my knowledge. It wasn't long ago that most of [ORGANIZATION]'s unhoused population lived in downtown [ORGANIZATION], but as the population has shifted into southeast [ORGANIZATION], the bathrooms did not follow them. With no public bathrooms, this means that unhoused folks in southeast [ORGANIZATION] have very limited options."
10_25_2017,unhoused,"When it comes down to it, these barriers often leave people with no other option than to relieve themselves outside where they live. This is not only unhealthy and demeaning for those who live outside, but creates unhealthy and unpleasant green spaces for their housed neighbors, which serves to increase tension among the housed and unhoused. Women I work with face particular challenges when dealing with menstruation and urination without restrooms."
10_25_2017,homelessness,"However, the infrastructure leaves them with no other options. Despite how it may sound, I am not here to blame the city or to criticize the city's work that it does to serve all its citizens. [ORGANIZATION] is considered a leader in the services we provide and in prioritizing homelessness as an issue we care about, and I am proud of that fact."
10_25_2017,homelessness; unhoused,"And lastly, providing public restrooms when continued to demonstrate [ORGANIZATION]'s effective leadership in addressing its homelessness crisis. Our homelessness crisis may not disappear overnight, but I have confidence that with the city's leadership and creativity, the hygiene challenges of many unhoused citizens in southeast [ORGANIZATION] can. Thank you for your time."
10_25_2017,homelessness,"But, I mean, I also agree it's a serious problem. And what we've experienced...  when we bring up this conversation, there's a lot of pushback from the neighborhoods who feel that we're going to be encouraging or entrenching homelessness. But I think it's pretty clear that it's there and everyone needs facilities."
10_25_2017,homelessness,"I don't know if he's got [ORGANIZATION] or if he's got pneumonia. DATE0 plan to end homelessness, where's it at?"
10_25_2017,homeless,"No plan at all, huh? Well, you know, from my earlier testimony when she was talking about, you know, everybody moving to southeast, the homeless. Well, it looks like you've been successful in sweeping the homeless out of the west part of town, huh?"
10_25_2017,affordable housing,"Direct ORG0 to adopt an affordable housing green building policy for new construction and rehabilitation. Call the roll, please. [ORGANIZATION]."
10_25_2017,affordable housing,"Well, I want to congratulate [ORGANIZATION]. I think they've come up with a good set of guidelines to ensure that much of the affordable housing that gets built in this city or renovated is done in a manner that lives lightly on the land. So I appreciate that."
10_25_2017,houseless,"And he preyed on this young individual, who is also houseless, to be an informant and has put this person at great risk in the community, both with the police and the rest of the community.  and has ripped their community away from them. If this is the kind of stuff that [ORGANIZATION] supports, if this is the kind of leadership that she represents, she needs to get out. We don't want her here either."
10_25_2017,affordable housing; houseless,"We can't get funding for  for actual affordable housing that's affordable for people who don't make $60,000 a year with a 650 credit score. We can't get warming shelters for our houseless community. We still don't have an emergency action plan and yet $100,000 for this historically racist white bread rose festival that they're congratulating themselves on.  are represented by a person of color, we don't hear them coming up here and talking about the impacts on that community, or how about the aspect of rape culture that the Rose Festival and Fleet Week bring."
10_25_2017,houseless,"I feel like if I was a better activist...  I'd figure out a [STREET] to come forward to ask you guys for like a million bucks, because you guys seem to give money to whoever asks for it. I know you wouldn't do it for me. I'd ask for a million bucks so that I could give this money directly to the houseless."
10_25_2017,houseless,"This report was so good, so in-depth. I mean, they looked at a lot of stuff. Why can't we do that for the houseless?"
09_25_2019,homelessness,"What has become very interesting for me as I began this process is realizing that, as I said earlier, myself is not only a victim of sexual violence, but many of the people that are going through this system, that are going to jail, that are having the effects of homelessness, are entering into sex. prostitution, sex workers prostitution, are engaging with law enforcement agencies. And that, for me, is concerning when the oversight, I feel like the oversight is not really centered around victim."
09_25_2019,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], the ORG1 staff worked with ORG2, [PERSON], [LOCATION], local licensed industrial hygienists and contractors certified in dealing with mold and lead-based paint to develop a model approach that incorporates best practices with the goal of ensuring the new requirements are reasonable and provide a path for improving housing conditions which often have a direct impact on the half of the health of our most vulnerable residents. [ORGANIZATION] staff also worked with [ORGANIZATION] and Housing GPE0's ORG6 that included ORG7, [ORGANIZATION], ORG9, ORG10, [ORGANIZATION], and ORG12. I am very pleased to present these changes to our property maintenance code, which includes first of its kind regulations for addressing mold in rental units, as well as new and enhanced requirements to control lead based paint and pests."
09_25_2019,affordable housing,"This program is valuable. It only applies to rental units, and typically, most [ORGANIZATION] cases involve older multifamily units, which represent a large number of the affordable housing units here in [ORGANIZATION], whereby maintenance and upkeep throughout a building and individual units is critical. Finally, we recognize the value in involving a wide variety of community members and housing stakeholders in drafting regulations."
09_25_2019,affordable housing,"Well, I mean, I asked the question because clearly I live in a community that has some poorly maintained affordable housing units. And if you're a tenant and you're living in a poorly maintained apartment complex, it's not to your advantage to turn in your landlord to tell someone how horribly bad your unit is, especially when you can't afford to move. So I do think that that's a critical issue that through the administrative rules process, we have to create a safe [STREET] that people can say this is the problem without them being negatively impacted by that."
09_25_2019,affordable housing,"Then we hit the worst recession in our lifetime and in fact, for [ORGANIZATION], about the only construction that occurred in the city was affordable housing, thanks to stimulus dollars and thanks to other tools that we had. The concern that I have on any of these programs is that we have the staffing and the resources to actually do the job. Because when we announce that we're going to start doing something like inspections and we're putting this into our code, we have to have the resources to make sure that we can deliver."
09_25_2019,homeless,"Hi. PERSON0, [PERSON]. I know somebody who could be described as a [ORGANIZATION] patient in that he's neurologically different from – the rest of the population and he was put in an [ORGANIZATION] and I don't know if the [ORGANIZATION] is different from the shelters or the subsidized housing but he left both due to the conditions of the unit And because of the noise factor, probably thin walls and cheap housing do, you know, he could hear the neighbors."
09_25_2019,homeless,"And he left and he's currently homeless and has been on the streets, I think now for [ORGANIZATION], he just left the unit. And so, you know, we have people who are disabled who are leaving units that are awful. And they're choosing to sleep out on the streets rather than sleep in units that are so awful."
09_25_2019,homeless,"I am not a property owner or a landlord. I am someone that cares about the health and safety and basic human rights of people in the city. And finally, [ORGANIZATION] mentioned a concern about not only do tenants have to fear retaliation, they have to fear displacement and becoming homeless."
09_25_2019,housing crisis,[ORGANIZATION] members provide valuable perspective and expertise as we work to address the rental housing crisis in our city. The appointment and reappointments [ORGANIZATION] allow the commission to continue its good work and to continue advising [ORGANIZATION] and the council on the most relevant housing topics. I want to thank all of you for either being willing to serve or being willing to continue to serve on this important commission.
09_25_2019,affordable housing,"So the changes [ORGANIZATION] are technical in nature primarily, so with regard to the application and screening code there are a number of clarifications in terms of terms and definitions. around what the language used to describe regulated affordable housing and regulated rents. And I think the one substantive change was a request that came from council members when this ordinance was originally discussed, which had to do with the [ORGANIZATION] exemption, where there's an [ORGANIZATION] exemption for a landlord living in the main home and renting out the [ORGANIZATION], or living in the [ORGANIZATION] and renting out the main home."
09_25_2019,affordable housing,"Can you describe that process for us, please? Sure. So we, over [ORGANIZATION], informally engaged with rental organizations as well as property management, industry associations, individual property managers, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], which represents the city's affordable housing providers, and other interested stakeholders."
09_25_2019,affordable housing,"I just have one question, which is the definition of affordable housing. Because what I see is that it says federal, state, or local government. Affordable housing by a federal, state, or local government is exempt."
09_25_2019,affordable housing,"I just think the clearer we are about what we mean when we say affordable housing, right? Because we know people are paying an extraordinary amount of money for rooms and people's houses. And so it would be great as we continue to move forward that we put a definition attached to it."
09_25_2019,affordable housing,"But I agree that the term affordable housing is elusive and needs clarification, but I read this as exempting the government-sponsored housing. Am I right? Correct."
09_25_2019,homelessness,She has experience working with people experiencing homelessness and [ORGANIZATION] youth in healthcare settings and continues to push for mobility justice and participatory budgeting through her grassroots nonprofit involvement. I'm incredibly excited to have [ORGANIZATION] here as part of this inaugural committee. To [ORGANIZATION]'s left is PERSON1.
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"And with that, we will... PERSON0, could you read the items, please? Item [DATE], provide affordable housing through an inclusionary housing program."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"And [ORGANIZATION], provide affordable housing through an inclusionary program and update the multiple unit limited tax exemption program. Well, thank you. I'll provide some opening remarks."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"DATE0, [ORGANIZATION]...  took a controversial and bold step to ensure resources available for affordable housing by adopting an urban renewal set-aside policy and that policy has for [ORGANIZATION] provided the majority of our funding for affordable housing and has ensured that thousands of affordable units in specific have been built in specific portions of our city and now it's time to take things to the next level DATE2 we are considering a new tool that will create affordable units throughout the city inclusionary housing  a step towards ensuring that generations of [ORGANIZATION] will live in economically integrated neighborhoods. Inclusionary housing is a policy that would give working [ORGANIZATION] the possibility of living in the neighborhood they work, something that used to be a reality but is becoming more and more unattainable in large swaths of our city, areas like FAC0, FAC1, [ORGANIZATION]. Inclusionary housing is a policy that gives families and children the prospect of living in mixed-income buildings and an economically diverse neighborhood, which will improve their chances to be successful in life."
12_13_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,"Inclusionary housing will not solve our affordable housing crisis, but it is a critical step towards more affordable housing in our city now and in the future. Fundamentally, inclusionary housing is about opportunity and equity. We are a city that prides ourselves on planning well."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"The second amendment is based on a conversation we had at the work session with the consultants, with [ORGANIZATION] and associates. And we were talking about the fact that in the current market it seems like it's mostly studios and one bedrooms that are being built. So if that's all that is offered as affordable housing, then there might not be any family housing."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"Several cities, including [ORGANIZATION], actually have set their fee low enough to actually encourage developers to pay the fee rather than to provide the units. And we've said repeatedly that receiving the fee is not in the city's best interest because  because we then have to use that fee to go out and compete with the private sector to buy land, and there's often a three- to [DATE] time lag between the time we receive the fee to the time we can actually produce the unit. It's much more efficacious, much more efficient to tap the hydraulics of the private market and cause affordable housing to be developed where the private investment is occurring at the same time."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"Is it worth considering what happens in the event of a significant change in market conditions? Yes.  like a huge spike in interest rates or something else. We've been through something like that recently called the Great Recession, where the off-site option no longer pencils out, but we have an interest in maybe converting it to a fee in lieu or something so that we can add it to our toolkit and do affordable housing."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"This is an office with a hotel combined, and in order to demonstrate public benefit for the FAR transfer, there will be 20 affordable housing units built in a 60-unit project immediately to the west on the [ORGANIZATION] blocks. Those housing units will be affirmatively and fairly marketed to hotel service workers. So you have a workforce housing nexus between the hotel and the housing, which we think is important.  quite compelling."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"And frankly, in the although [ORGANIZATION], the hotel developer, happens to be a housing developer, which is somewhat unique. To his credit, he can do both. But many private developers that are doing perhaps condos or not interested in doing affordable housing, they would ally most probably with a nonprofit partner to do the off-site housing on an adjacent site."
12_13_2016,housing crisis,"We've observed the change in our neighborhoods as block by block, for sale, and new construction signs became ubiquitous in every quadrant. A lot of folks from the [ORGANIZATION] community and their members desperately wanted to be here [TIME], but they can't. Some are in [PERSON] sharing stories and furthering policy ideas with our elected representatives to address other aspects of our statewide housing crisis, such as renter protections and rent stabilization."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"Others are directly impacted by the lack of affordable housing, aren't here because they can't afford to take [TIME] off work. And then there are those who have been pushed so far to the fringes of our city due to the lack of affordable housing that what would have been a short bus ride down to FAC0 to appeal directly to you in person has now become a complicated scheduling endeavor of multiple transit trips. It simply takes too long."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"We're appealing to every level of government because we must. And despite working with shoestring budgets, despite addressing the multitude of real and pressing threats to our community's livability in this city,  We've been successful in unlocking the tools which this council can then use to address affordable housing production and housing choice, like the construction excise tax and inclusionary zoning. We're going back this upcoming legislative session for meaningful renters' protections and rent stabilization, and yes, we will succeed there too."
12_13_2016,housing crisis,"[ORGANIZATION]'s housing crisis is amongst the worst in the nation, while we remain an attractive [STREET] for people to move. We must act with a sense of urgency to stop the resegregation of our communities where unaffordable housing is the only option being built. There are claims that this inclusionary housing proposal will stifle and even stop development entirely, that it will exacerbate an ever-worsening housing crisis."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"And we've promised a livable city, and that means a couple of things. It means affordable housing. It means good jobs."
12_13_2016,homeless,"I've also been severely rent burdened at times, spending more than 90% of my [ORGANIZATION] income on rent. And when that became unsustainable, for [PERSON] I've been homeless, living on the streets of the city of [ORGANIZATION]. For [PERSON], I've risen early from whatever doorway I've been sleeping in, went to the nearest [ORGANIZATION] men's room to clean up, and ridden my bike to the [ORGANIZATION] [TIME] meetings of [ORGANIZATION], the group that you charged with advising you on the creation of [ORGANIZATION]'s inclusionary housing policy."
12_13_2016,housing crisis,"Their argument is that the city should abandon the independent economic analysis that it paid for and instead use their analysis, which perhaps not surprisingly shows that they should be given millions in additional tax abatements and fee waivers. I was in this room back in [ORGANIZATION] when you referred the housing bond measure to the voters. And at that time, a couple of members of this council mentioned that before going to the voters to help solve the housing crisis, the city's leadership would ensure that other constituencies be part of the solution, too."
12_13_2016,housing crisis,"[ORGANIZATION] is to solve our housing crisis as a community, and a strong inclusionary housing program is an essential tool to doing that. So I hope you will support the strongest possible program, and I'm happy to answer any questions if you'd like. Any questions for the panel?"
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"Few compared to what? Right now, the construction of buildings with over 20 units in [ORGANIZATION] is generating zero affordable housing. Now, certainly, this ordinance is not a panacea for [ORGANIZATION]'s housing affordability challenges, but it's an important component of the solution."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"Moderate income households who occupy the newly built set-aside affordable dwellings.  even lower-income households who occupy newly developed subsidized housing that could be generated through the in-lieu fees or the off-site requirements, and obviously all [ORGANIZATION] citizens will benefit from  Those are the people who believe we should strive, we've heard [TIME], for more economic diversity in our neighborhoods, more affordable housing for our neediest citizens. [ORGANIZATION]ers as a whole will reap sizable social, economic, and environmental benefits from the mixed income communities that will result. This is what a fair, progressive housing policy should do."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"It should ask the advantaged to.  with the greatest ability to pay, to bear most of the costs of a policy that primarily benefits the disadvantaged and those with the less ability to pay. I support the proposed ordinance because the gains will outweigh the costs and the costs will primarily be borne by those who can most afford it. This inclusionary housing ordinance is no panacea for [ORGANIZATION]'s affordable housing challenges, but it's an important component that is both effective and equitable, and I strongly urge its adoption by this council."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"We just have to be careful that we get it right, and it can be a cautionary tale if we don't. So I think in summary, we want to say that we want to start with a more measured inclusionary housing program that can be adjusted over time and see what the market supports. And so what's going to – [ORGANIZATION], we've offered up four amendments to the inclusionary housing proposal, which will start [ORGANIZATION] on both a competent and measured footing, keeping production up and growing more and more affordable housing as time moves forward."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,We think it's important to use. support affordable housing and get it in the buildings that we're building. So how do we do that?
12_13_2016,homelessness,"And in [ORGANIZATION], we have very importantly focused resources on those experiencing homelessness and extremely low-income families. Those are critical needs. At the same time, the burden of housing costs is being felt increasingly by these low and moderate income households that would be covered by the inclusionary housing policy."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"We are going to be the [STREET] for progressive action and for solving the kinds of problems and challenges that cities face with inequity and affordable housing. And the need to carefully leverage public resources is the reason that cities and counties have innovated with the inclusionary zoning tool.  to use the efficiency of the private development sector to build units that are affordable, and to do that alongside of market rate units, creating mixed income communities. And right now, we're seeing cities move to add this tool or strengthen this tool."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"I think that the proposal you have in front of you [ORGANIZATION] does that. It balances the need for projects to pencil with the deep need in our community for more affordable housing. And I believe that it will lead to the development of hundreds of new units of housing where we need them the most, in neighborhoods with good schools, neighborhoods with grocery stores, and neighborhoods with parks and community centers."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] has worked hard to put together a program that will work, and Commissioner [PERSON] and I have been meeting regularly to identify how to pay for the subsidies that we will need to provide under the law. In the past, we've had an [ORGANIZATION] cap on property tax abatements for affordable housing of $3 million, and what I understand that we're looking at [LOCATION] is to rethink how we calculate that cap, tracking it over DATE2 DATE3 instead of one. This will allow ORG1 to be responsive to the market and ensure that the subsidy is available when we need it."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"Well, what we're looking at is doing a [ORGANIZATION] rolling so that people,  That won't happen, but I mean, I don't think you can predict in the future if this program is wildly successful, then I think we come back and have a conversation about how we increase the cap or how we make sure that there is the subsidies necessary. To me, this is our number one priority in our community right now is making sure that we have housing affordable for people who are living here. And there's going to have to be tradeoffs and there's going to have to be prioritization, but putting money into affordable housing is – and we've all worked really hard to pass the bond."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"It's always very poignant to see you here advocating for affordable housing, which is a great cause of your mother's, and we all miss her very much. The second thing is I don't want what you said about loving [ORGANIZATION] to be used against you as the county chair, so I just wanted to give you an opportunity to also state that you love [PERSON], GPE2, [PERSON], and GPE4 equally much. Exactly."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"There are four key amendments needed to ensure that the new inclusionary housing program encourages adequate housing production and creates more affordable housing units. One, collapse the two proposed [LOCATION] inclusionary rate and incentive packages into one,  Using the more robust incentive package that includes a density bonus, tax abatement on all units, [ORGANIZATION] exemption on affordable units, and [ORGANIZATION] waivers on affordable units at 60% [ORGANIZATION]. This will help ensure that critical areas of [ORGANIZATION] with 4.0 FAR, such as the post office or FAC0, are not underbuilt where high-rise density would otherwise happen."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"Third, add language regarding central city master plans or development agreements where the city deems better affordable housing results can be achieved. And last, fourth, ramp up the inclusion rate as the market supports the increase. We realize that there may be concerns that if the initial rate is set low, it won't ever be increased."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"An amended inclusionary housing program will produce more housing overall, including affordable, and continue to build [ORGANIZATION] and ORG1 funds for more deeply affordable housing. Thank you for your work, and I'm happy to answer any questions about amendments or the model we use to calibrate the inclusion rates. Thank you."
12_13_2016,housing crisis,"The city of [ORGANIZATION] is having a housing crisis, and though it is important to address the pressing problem facing us [ORGANIZATION], it is equally important to consider the long-term implications DATE1 even DATE2 down the [STREET]. What happens if development of apartments decreases or stalls?  Housing units that may have been built might not be built. What happens if a 30-unit apartment building subject to inclusionary housing, for example, now turns into a retail center or industrial warehouse?"
12_13_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,"Families are having to choose between buying a much-needed car to get to work and paying the rapidly rising rents. The lack of affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION] is harming the health and well-being of children and families, and [ORGANIZATION] must take action. Obviously, the housing crisis requires a package of different strategies, and inclusive housing is just a part of that solution."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,We will realize that inclusionary housing is only one tool that we need in order to build affordable housing. It is an important one and one that we have to design really well. I can appreciate the fact that [ORGANIZATION] is certainly not the end of the discussion around inclusionary housing and what we're going to do in order to take care of the state of emergency that we have in our housing.
12_13_2016,homelessness,"These are the joint staff who, [ORGANIZATION] when council was cancelled, were out there on the streets ensuring that people did not die in the severe weather conditions that we had. They're the people that we rely on to be the front lines of our ending homelessness fight. These are the people who can barely afford to live in [ORGANIZATION] any longer."
12_13_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,"This social contract applies to all of us who benefit from society, but there is a special obligation on developers for housing, given the heavy role they played in creating the crisis shortage of affordable housing through their lobbyists and helping to ban anyone or any community in [ORGANIZATION] from using [ORGANIZATION]. The developer community does indeed have a special obligation to help solve our housing crisis. Don't let them stand in the [STREET] again of meaningful progress on affordable housing."
12_13_2016,housing crisis,[ORGANIZATION] is one tool toward that end. It's unfortunate that a sense of entitlement among some developers appears stronger than their sense of responsibility for the community that has prospered them or responsibility for their role in creating the housing crisis we suffer [ORGANIZATION]. We need certainty that the city is doing everything it can to resolve this crisis.
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"We believe that this speaks to the paucity of community spirit among the ranks of developers who appear to lock arms in greed with landlords who are practicing no-cause evictions in our city. We call this a singular poverty of community spirit and consider such greed regrettable. We applaud all voluntary contributions to the city's affordable housing stock, and there's been some discussions among the council members to take a look at what can be worked out in terms of compromises for those that are not subject to this requirement."
12_13_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,"They are the most vulnerable of our population and can least afford what is currently happening during the housing crisis. There is a great need for an increase in affordable housing, and we feel there is no [STREET] the city, county, or state can build our [STREET] out of the crisis by themselves. It is going to take the private sector in partnership to make sure there is adequate, affordable housing for our residents of low and modest means."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"We do not support efforts to provide a full offset of public dollars or efforts to hold harmless developers for all costs associated with the creation of inclusionary zonings required affordable housing unit. The state only required incentives and not full offset for developers' costs, and the expert task force and [ORGAN[LOCATION]ATION] crafted a proposal that was more than fair. After listening to Dr. [PERSON]' testimony at the council work session, it is apparent that what is being considered now is far more generous than other cities are giving in [LOCATION] programs."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"What happens to the individuals and families facing houselessness when they receive a no-cause eviction or a rent increase, along with a lack in affordable housing on the market? Where will my [ORGANIZATION] go, my fiancé, my dog, and I? DATE1, 83 people died on the streets."
12_13_2016,housing crisis,"We have been to council to discuss the [ORGANIZATION] to 50, the housing bond, construction excise tax, parking minimums, the comp plan, and the residential infill project. But we haven't seen anything on tenant protection since [ORGANIZATION]. And no surprise, the housing crisis is only getting worse."
12_13_2016,houseless,"i'm not here to talk to you because i'm worried about my bottom line or my career as a real estate developer i'm a cost burden renter with a special needs child with a husband who works [TIME] a week  who can't afford to live in southwest [ORGANIZATION] anymore. And as [ORGANIZATION] continues to go forward, we're going to see more low-income citizens just like me who lived here my entire life with no [STREET] to go, living on [DATE], hoping that houseless people will take us in because we will have nowhere to go. We need inclusionary zoning [ORGANIZATION]."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"Thank you for this opportunity to speak. My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I am a tenant at [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION] and an organizer of ORG1. I'm here to support inclusionary housing, but also to address a related and more urgent issue, and that is what can be done now to assure safe, stable, and affordable housing for [ORGANIZATION]'s renters."
12_13_2016,homelessness,"You can't wait forever to take... We can't wait forever to...  however many [ORGANIZATION] it will take for inclusionary housing to make a difference. Tenants in [ORGANIZATION] are facing displacement and homelessness [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]."
12_13_2016,housing crisis,We're being forced out of [ORGANIZATION]. We cannot build our [STREET] out of this housing crisis. We cannot inclusionary zone our [STREET] out of this crisis.
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"We need a rent freeze now, and we need rent control, and we need a [ORGANIZATION]' Bill of Rights that supports people who make this city. A city that does not offer its citizens a fair opportunity to have stable, affordable housing when there is available supply is an unreasonable and unjust city. We demand that all the citizens of [ORGANIZATION] receive access to stable and affordable housing."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"Without this, we are not a city and we are not equal. Those of us who rent, 49% of [ORGANIZATION]ers are in a crisis. Affordable housing is disappearing, wages are not increasing fast enough, food costs are inflating, and the general livability of [ORGANIZATION] is out of reach for many long-time residents."
12_13_2016,housing crisis,"Our city government, through lack of action around this housing crisis, is selling out tenants to developers. Inclusionary zoning is necessary, but this alone will not solve the problems that we face. In terms of housing policy, we must have a rent freeze."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"We know that developers do not build affordable units unless you make them do so, at least not in [ORGANIZATION]. Unless we make them develop affordable housing, they will continue to flood the market and overbuild luxury units. It's no wonder they call themselves locusts."
12_13_2016,homeless; affordable housing,"We do housing assistance, and we focus on the very, very low-income homeless and at-risk homeless seniors. Inclusionary zoning is a great idea. tool for the package of affordable housing tools in [ORGANIZATION], and we support it wholeheartedly."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"PERSON0 i'm the community engagement coordinator for 1000 friends of [ORGANIZATION] and a lifelong portlander and i'm here [ORGANIZATION] to lend our full support for inclusionary zoning i believe our interim director [PERSON] submitted written testimony so i won't read that off at you but how often do i get a chance to impersonate my boss up here um  So [ORGANIZATION] has been engaged in affordable housing issues since we were founded [LOCATION]. And as I'm sure you know, goal 10 of [PERSON]'s land use planning program is housing."
12_13_2016,housing crisis,"Okay. okay ma'am uh thank you for the opportunity to be here [ORGANIZATION] my name is [ORGANIZATION] and i'm the assistant director at [ORGANIZATION] uh we're a [STREET]-based ORG1 in [ORGANIZATION] um and a non-profit housing developer and we i'm here [ORGANIZATION] to urge uh city council to support inclusionary zoning we all know [ORGANIZATION] is in the midst of an unprecedented housing crisis to solve this crisis we need every tool available to combat the problem  We're really proud of [LOCATION] for working so hard over [LOCATION] to pass important legislation to support giving people a safe [STREET] to call home. DATE2, we have the chance to pair inclusionary zoning with other housing efforts like the recently approved general obligation bond, a short-term rental tax, and a construction excise tax."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"We know the answer to giving people a safe [STREET] to call home is through innovative partnerships. Passing inclusionary zoning will provide an opportunity for for-profit developers to contribute to the solution. In short, inclusionary zoning offers an opportunity for our city to grow strategically and provide all Portlanders with better access to affordable housing."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"Okay. I am [PERSON], and I chair [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION], better known as ORG2. We want affordable housing in our growing neighborhood."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,We do not want to lose affordable housing to off-site transfers. We ask that you limit off-site transfers. The one-half-mile rule you've imposed is good.
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"We suggest that a better rule may be to limit transfers within the neighborhood or not allow them at all. Next, we believe that the cost of affordable housing should be shared by everyone, and  Eliminating parking minimums for affordable housing places a disproportionate burden on residences and businesses in the immediate vicinity of the affordable housing. Residents are faced with reduced on-[STREET] parking, increased congestion, decreased pedestrian, vehicular, and bicycle safety, and a reduced quality of life."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"Businesses have restricted customer access, which can affect their survivability. Therefore, we ask that you do not reduce the existing parking minimums. Our fear is that with transfers, we would get neither affordable housing nor parking."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,okay [ORGANIZATION] i think you were called first all right good [TIME] commissioners my name is [PERSON] and i am the communications and engagement manager at [ORGANIZATION] i'm honored to be here [ORGANIZATION] inclusionary zoning has incredible potential to create affordability diversity and opportunity throughout [ORGANIZATION] and as a coalition ORG1 is urging you to pass this policy as we continue to fight for more affordable housing solutions throughout the metro area  We need far-reaching solutions to address the comprehensive need in our region.
12_13_2016,homelessness; housing crisis,"We can give modest income earners more housing choice, thus taking the pressure off of low-income renters who are facing rent increases of hundreds of dollars at a time. There are Portlanders who have modest wage jobs that simply aren't enough to ensure a safe and permanent home. In a sad twist of fate, this includes the very social workers who are working on the front lines of our housing crisis to prevent people from transitioning into homelessness."
12_13_2016,housing crisis,"Lower income renters disproportionately are persons with disabilities. These disparities among numerous protected classes are factors a jurisdiction must consider in its efforts to proactively, affirmatively further fair housing under the Fair Housing Act. Finally, we know that inclusionary housing is only one of the tools that you're working to solve our housing crisis."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"A financial worksheet should include routinely and should be accessible to all stakeholders, including [ORGANIZATION] staff, local housing community, and the affordable housing advocates. These include calculations of all costs. Sorry, your time is up."
12_13_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,"I'm a member of [ORGANIZATION]. And just because of its some relevance, I will mention I also served [ORGANIZATION] on ORG1 of ORG2, now [PERSON]. And briefly, I was as moved as anyone listening to the eloquent testimony [ORGANIZATION] articulating what the problem is we're all dealing with, the affordable housing crisis and the problems it creates for the citizens of [ORGANIZATION]."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"I think many of us on the commission, myself personally, have been working for these kinds of affordable housing solutions to be implemented. And so I just wanted to give you a couple of the concerns the commissioners raised [ORGANIZATION]. And they should be kept in mind as obviously we're going to go forward as a city with [ORGANIZATION]."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] is one of the oldest African American service, civil rights, and advocacy organizations in the area. And we are also part of ORG1. I just want to say that it is simply not enough to just supply affordable housing."
12_13_2016,homeless,"Many of our folks are terrified of being put out on the [STREET], and black people are the highest community that are homeless right now. And speaking from a personal perspective, I feel insecure in being in an apartment right now where I can afford, but because there are very few limited options to me and many of my colleagues, I can afford to live in a apartment. I am nervous of if for some reason I can't be in the [STREET] I am now, where am I going to go?"
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"So I know a little bit of what I speak. I'm also a developer of multifamily housing. I have built affordable housing, and I know how difficult it is to get it out of the ground."
12_13_2016,homelessness,"Hi, I'm PERSON0. I'm the Director of Real Estate Development at [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] has been actively working in the community for [ORGANIZATION], helping people experiencing homelessness find stable housing,  and engage in meaningful life change and reconnection with the larger [ORGANIZATION] community."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"On the bond that just went through, we recognize that that will probably support about 1,500 more units of housing on the market for affordable housing. Just note that this inclusionary zoning, there's about 22,000 units in this stage of construction or permitting right now. And if you were to put this inclusionary zoning, about 15% to 20% of those units would be about 3,500 units more of affordable housing, so much more than your bond."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"I'm PERSON0, a principal at [ORGANIZATION]. We've been in business in [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION] and we have 150 employees who desperately need affordable housing. We definitely support inclusionary housing as long as it doesn't discourage production because then no one here in the room gets what we're looking for."
12_13_2016,homelessness,"My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I am here to urge you to support the inflationary housing policy. This proposal will work to increase housing affordability while also reducing racial and economic segregation. I have faced homelessness in the past with my children, and I was very fortunate to be able to find a job that  that pays a living wage."
12_13_2016,homeless,"I've been fortunate enough to be able to afford rent in [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION], although I was close to being homeless at one point. And there was a housing development in LOC0 DATE1 where they reserved 20 units for veterans, lower income or whatever, however they described it. I was glad I didn't go down to try to sign up because the line –  was out the door, down the block, and around the corner, camped out on the sidewalk for [ORGANIZATION] waiting."
10_07_2015,homeless; affordable housing,"I'm a pastor. I gave away all my possessions [ORGANIZATION] and I decided to go out into the streets and live with the homeless community to see what's really going on and to actually experience sleep deprivation, malnutrition and non-regenerative sleep and how it affects the person and how a person's higher intellect is affected and they're only thinking basically with their base survival thought process out there, which explains a lot of irrational behavior with homeless people on the [STREET]. [PERSON], I spoke here and I quoted the Pope by saying...  That the poor have become the collateral damage of the wealthy, and that has never been more prevalent than DATE2 with out-of-control rents, lack of affordable housing, and homeless advocates such as myself are looking forward to a rush, a flood of more homeless people coming out onto the streets."
10_07_2015,homeless,They were thrown out of their house because of a no-cause eviction. The thing that I'm finding really disturbing is that there's a monetization and industrialization of the human suffering through the homeless market. It's become profitable for some people to create themselves six-figure digits as administrators in some of these places and then really actually forgetting what it is that they're trying to do.
10_07_2015,homelessness,"There are certain areas that are designated or can be designated as campgrounds. A yurt community can look just like a micro-community, and it'd be more...  tasteful for the community. Yes, there's going to be some ugliness to rehousing homelessness, and it's going to look a little bad at first, but it will get better."
10_07_2015,houseless,"We need to forge ahead and make certain that if someone needs or wants to come off the [STREET], they have that opportunity. We need to encourage beautification.  and perhaps put more of the houseless community to work in programs like [ORGANIZATION] to clean up their own streets and our streets [ORGANIZATION] so that at least we can be better, cleaner neighbors. The new FAC0 intersection is opening soon."
10_07_2015,affordable housing,"We call it at [ORGANIZATION] generations, and it's the beginning of the [STREET] things used to be. Combining 40 units of affordable housing with a [INSTITUTION] and early learning academy on [DATE] acres in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood, ORG1 offers families, neighbors, and friends the love, the respect, and the dignity that has graced so many other [ORGANIZATION] communities, but until now has been an elusive dream to too many natives living in [ORGANIZATION]. In [ORGANIZATION], I'm going to reach out to each and every one of you and ask you for your support to make this dream a reality."
10_07_2015,homeless,"It's important that  We help those that want help. We know that people need help, but it's good to offer these things. I know [ORGANIZATION], the officer of the parks, he's a kind man who's offering assistance to the homeless to get services, not to bust them, you know."
10_07_2015,homeless; homelessness,"And that's what we need is more education, like just bringing it more on out. I am a homeless advocate and I've always talked about homelessness and also that up in [ORGANIZATION] I was one of the board members of a [STREET] called Chief [ORGANIZATION] Club, which was a Native American day shelter I was a third dishwasher, but I was also a board member and as a board member I was the only homeless person on that board. So they asked what can we do for the homeless people?"
10_07_2015,affordable housing,"So this right here is what I'm saying is that making these ties or bringing this on out, it would make us stronger band or working together kind of thing. I also would like to say that the gentleman that was asking about the affordable housing, yeah,"
10_07_2015,affordable housing,"OK. Thanks. Next we have [ORGANIZATION], I hope I said his name correctly, from [ORGANIZATION], who will speak about improving access to affordable housing."
10_07_2015,affordable housing,"[TIME]. Mayor [PERSON], commissioners, my name is PERSON1 with [PERSON]. And so the proposal that [PERSON] submitted is improving access to affordable housing."
10_07_2015,affordable housing,"And so to kind of set the context for that, one issue we've known for a while that we needed to work on and there was an area for improvement is the ability for rental households to find out exactly what rental units were supported by [ORGANIZATION] through direct financing or one of our regulatory programs,  well as the application process to actually get into those units so as it currently stands the city takes a fairly passive role in the actual application and rental of the unit there are a number of partner property management companies that advertise vacancies in the units and that facilitate the application process  for a renter household that can create difficulties because the regulated units are managed by a host of partner organizations. And so these households have to go to many different websites or organizations to find out not only about the regulated units, their cost and their availability, but to actually submit an application, pay an application fee, and this happens multiple times. And so with the expansion, so looking forward as the city and you all as the city council have moved forward on increasing the tax exemption for rental units through the city's multi-program, as the city increasingly looks at getting affordable housing units through density bonuses in the central city, as well as the mixed-use zoning outside the central city, we anticipate an increase in the number of property management firms,  joining the regulated affordable housing industry."
10_07_2015,affordable housing,"That's a good thing. We need a greater supply of affordable housing, but that can have a potential  potentially negative impact on the renter households trying to access housing. As you increase the number of companies managing units, you increase the number of companies that individuals need to call or visit websites or visit offices to get information."
10_07_2015,affordable housing,"And so this proposal is to develop a web application that will not only identify all of the city's regulated affordable housing units, but actually facilitate the application to those units  by listing when the units are vacant, regardless of what property owner and property management firm is administering those units, and then provide a process on the back end to facilitate a notification of vacancy and an application process. The analogy that I've been using that I think has helped folks understand is [URL], that Government Jobs Act has a conduit between individuals applying for a job in government service and any number of government agencies, the city, the county, the state, and other governments around the region. To the applicant, all they see is one applicant profile they have to create online,  They see a comprehensive list of openings, and then the web application facilitates their application to the job to the city governments, governments in general."
10_07_2015,affordable housing,Amend Affordable Housing Preservation Code to add [ORGANIZATION] renter protections. Item [DATE]. Amend
10_07_2015,homelessness,"Title 15 Emergency Code to authorize [ORGANIZATION] to declare a housing emergency under specified circumstances and define duration and [ORGANIZATION] powers during a housing emergency. And item [DATE], declare a housing emergency to address increased homelessness, identify council powers, specify [ORGANIZATION] duration, waive zoning code, and authorize request to governor for an emergency declaration. Thank you."
10_07_2015,homelessness,"You know, just a bunch of mayors here, right? But he meant that, that he knew, and that's why he convened mayors to talk about these issues, that the locus of activity and innovation is at the city level. And, in fact, when you look at the issues of climate and gun violence and housing and homelessness, in all three cases we're talking about huge issues, national issues or international issues."
10_07_2015,homeless,"And yet the activity and the innovation is happening at the local level, and that's why we're here. That's why we're considering an extraordinary action of a declaration of emergency about the cost of housing and the homeless crisis in our city. because this is where the action is."
10_07_2015,homeless; housing crisis,"And, in fact, if misery loves company, I guess we have some in this issue because all of the [ORGANIZATION] mayors...  are dealing with these same issues. I had the opportunity while I was at the FAC0 to speak with Mayor [PERSON] about this because [ORGANIZATION] is in a housing crisis as well. My friend and colleague [PERSON] has just had his city council consider and act on a state of emergency declaration that talks about many of the same issues there, except that the numbers are really shocking, 19,000 unsheltered homeless on [TIME]."
10_07_2015,homelessness; housing crisis,"Okay. So, again, these are big national issues. Income inequality and the other drivers of the housing crisis and the homelessness crisis are a national problem, but it is both our responsibility and the trend that innovation and action, decisive action in this case, is happening at the local level."
10_07_2015,homelessness; affordable housing,"So when we look at these twin crises of vanishing housing affordability and heart-wrenching homelessness, I think it's good to point out that we have done a lot with the tools that we've had. We've created, what, Commissioner [PERSON], 13,000 housing units, affordable housing units over [ORGANIZATION]. We've done some great work."
10_07_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"DATE0 we are here to provide some new tools to help us respond to the current housing crisis we find ourselves in, as well as to establish some renter protections in this ever-escalating rental market. We have over 1,800 people sleeping on our streets on any given [TIME]. We don't have enough affordable housing, nor do we have enough emergency shelter space to keep people safe and warm at [TIME]."
10_07_2015,affordable housing,"So we need to do more, and that's why I appreciate so much the mayor's declaration of emergency and his proposals he's making [ORGANIZATION]. And we'll also be talking about establishing some fundamental renter protections. But I did want to touch upon a few other things we are trying to deal with to address the issues of more affordable housing in our community."
10_07_2015,affordable housing,"We have currently 1,100 new affordable units in the pipeline. These are projects that have been funded and are underway in one form or another. And [ORGANIZATION] we will be deciding on funding for an additional 600 units of affordable housing throughout our city."
10_07_2015,affordable housing,"The council in [ORGANIZATION] will be talking about increasing the urban renewal amount of money set aside for affordable housing investments. And let me be clear, I will be asking this council to prioritize the addition of tens of millions of dollars of additional money from sort of the [ORGANIZATION] side of the ledger to the ORG1 side of the ledger so it can be invested in affordable housing. And on [LOCATION], I will be asking the council to take the first step towards a permanent citywide source of affordable housing known as a developer impact fee."
10_07_2015,affordable housing,"We will assess developers a fee to develop in our city to support the creation of thousands of more units of affordable housing. And finally, I did want to touch upon something that's in the works and will be coming to council, but it will be [ORGANIZATION]. And that's part of the comprehensive plan."
10_07_2015,affordable housing,"We have established proposals to establish new incentives. I mean, we're using somewhat the stick approach, but we also want to use the incentive approach by being able to offer developments additional height or density in exchange for a commitment to include affordable housing in the development or to pay into an affordable housing fund and in lieu of payment. So all these things are in the works, and it's going to be [ORGANIZATION]."
10_07_2015,affordable housing,"We need to make sure that tenants get more help to enforce their rights. And that is why with the mayor and [ORGANIZATION] announcement [ORGANIZATION] of some $30 million of additional funding for affordable housing in this [LOCATION]'s proposed budgets, there is an amount for a legal tenant enforcement team. And we see this legal enforcement team as indispensable to the tenant protections that we will hopefully enact after having a hearing DATE2 and a vote [ORGANIZATION]."
10_07_2015,homeless,"It's not a surprise to anyone in this room that so many people want to live in our community, or that people from around the country are pouring into [ORGANIZATION], or that our national and local economy is changing so dramatically, leaving so many people behind. The consequences are made visible to us [ORGANIZATION], whether we're talking about teardowns in FAC0, view corridors downtown, apartment buildings with limited parking,  food carts being replaced by $750,000 condos, [ORGANIZATION], short-term rentals, older adults forced out of their homes, homeless families and children in the [ORGANIZATION] blocks and in our natural areas, no-cause evictions for families living on FAC1, or the need for additional shelter space for some of our most vulnerable residents. We're talking about the same thing."
10_07_2015,homelessness; affordable housing,"That's not my opinion. That's the fact in [ORGANIZATION], in [PERSON], and in cities around the country. And that's why it's appropriate that this larger discussion has zeroed in on affordable housing and homelessness  and mayor why it is correct in my view for you to declare this emergency i am glad that the council's attention has been focused on this vital conversation and i am grateful for the chorus of community voices who have demanded that we take action i will support this declaration [ORGANIZATION] i will fight i will join each of you in fighting for new funding and i will support any reasonable proposal that relieves or prevents struggles facing those who have the least  and need the help the most."
10_07_2015,homelessness,"And I'm pleased that the mayor has chosen the plan that was developed by the community. It is a plan that has already been vetted. We don't have to reinvent the wheel, and it will make a dent in ending homelessness."
10_07_2015,affordable housing,"I will support increasing the [ORGANIZATION] set-aside from 30% to 50%. I will support Commissioner [PERSON]'s ordinance, which he intends to file shortly, to dedicate all revenue from short-term rentals like [ORGANIZATION] to [PERSON] so those resources can be used to replace the inventory of affordable housing we're losing. I support Commissioner [PERSON]'s request to fund a nexus study, a precondition to identifying a new impact fee."
10_07_2015,affordable housing,"Commissioner [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] have announced that they will do a pilot to test whether we can bring down the cost of new affordable housing. And at a time when we have few resources, it makes perfect sense to find common sense ways to reduce the cost and to house more people. I also believe that we have to continue to invest in community policing and effective outreach."
10_07_2015,homelessness,"And maybe, Mayor, if we keep faith with this exercise, the next time you meet with your mayors, you can tell them about the [ORGANIZATION] approach to ending homelessness, and we can become the national leader in that conversation. So thank you. Thank you very much."
10_07_2015,affordable housing,"by my colleagues' actions and proposals. I'm encouraged by Commissioner [PERSON] saying that he thinks that we might have a chance of having a new dedicated revenue source for affordable housing. I'm encouraged by the mayor saying that by declaring an emergency, we can give ourselves some tools to make it easier to house people."
10_07_2015,homelessness,"But one thing I don't want to do [ORGANIZATION] is to let the federal government off the hook. [PERSON] is not just a [ORGANIZATION] problem, it's a national problem, particularly acute in the cities of [ORGANIZATION], but you see the same problem in [PERSON] and elsewhere. [PERSON] and housing affordability are among several crises that the federal government is not facing up to."
10_07_2015,homelessness,"The declaration we bring to you [ORGANIZATION] to consider comes with a promise to all [ORGANIZATION]ers that we can respond to an emergency in the [ORGANIZATION] [STREET], a [STREET] that involves each of us looking out for our fellow [ORGANIZATION]ers, putting aside differences and digging deeper to make [ORGANIZATION] truly a safe, dry, warm home for all our inhabitants. There is no model to follow, no playbook we can borrow. What you have before you [ORGANIZATION] is the work of many people expert in housing and the issues of homelessness, aided by the compassion of others who simply know that we should be able to do more faster."
10_07_2015,homelessness,"Good [TIME], Mayor, [ORGANIZATION] members. My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I'm the Initiative Director for [ORGANIZATION]. You chartered a [ORGANIZATION] DATE0 to provide a shared set of priorities and strategies that could unite the ending homelessness efforts of [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], [PERSON], GPE2, as well as the important work that's being done by our federal and state partners and by the faith, philanthropic, and business communities."
10_07_2015,homelessness,"Our goal, your goal, simply put, is to prevent or end the homelessness of thousands of people  who find themselves sleeping on our streets and in our shelters [TIME]. Achieving this goal is not simple, but we knew that making progress would depend upon having a comprehensive plan with clearly articulated strategies and investment priorities for each of the critical dimensions of the problem of homelessness. Access to housing, economic opportunity, health care, and the need for basic safety while experiencing homelessness, what we call safety off the streets."
10_07_2015,homeless,"With direction from the executive committee, the 30-some members of [ORGANIZATION] worked with dozens of other community partners to develop action plans which, if fully implemented, could lead to a 50% reduction in the unmet need for permanent housing in our community. What we didn't know, even in [ORGANIZATION], when we were finalizing these plans, is the depth of the crisis in our housing market and that it would disrupt so many lives so quickly, with many more people becoming homeless than we've previously experienced. With rents increasing 40% over [DATE] period as the earnings for low-wage workers declined by more than 5%, we saw a 42% [ORGANIZATION] increase in the number of people accessing our emergency shelters."
10_07_2015,homelessness,"We also didn't foresee the significant rise in homelessness among some of the most vulnerable populations in our community. The recently released DATE0 [STREET] Count Report, although showing only a small overall increase in [STREET] and shelter homelessness, documented significant increases in homelessness among children,  the elderly, women, and African Americans. We know from the agencies working with these populations the lack of affordable vacancies has made finding housing an almost insurmountable challenge for a growing number of these very vulnerable people."
10_07_2015,homelessness,"So even though by starting to implement the strategies and investment priorities set out in our action plans, we were able to help more people than ever end their homelessness [ORGANIZATION], over 3,500 people. And we fully expect to exceed that number with the new initiatives already underway [LOCATION]. We know from the data and from what we are seeing on our streets DATE2 that if we're going to keep people safe and significantly reduce the number of people suffering homelessness in our community, it will take extraordinary action."
10_07_2015,homeless,"Our first priority is always to move someone who has become homeless into permanent housing. But while that process is underway, we have to be able to offer a safe [STREET] to spend [TIME] to those who are most vulnerable on our sidewalks. By removing the obstacles to siting shelter, we will be able to make life-saving places to sleep available more quickly."
10_07_2015,homeless; homelessness,"With the funding proposed, we will work with our faith and nonprofit partners to establish the projected [ADDRESS]."
10_07_2015,homeless,"With this funding, we will be able to help at least an additional 1,000 people avoid eviction and keep their housing. We will work with legal services to increase their ability to help tenants protect their rights, and we will work to support the implementation of Commissioner [PERSON]'s new proposed tenant protections. And third, we will increase the number of currently homeless people  who have access to permanent housing."
10_07_2015,homeless; homelessness,"We know that the best shelter and the only true solution to homelessness is permanent housing. Under the state of emergency and with the designated resources, we will help more than 1,300 additional women, children, and people with disabilities who are homeless move out of our shelters, off the streets, and back into permanent housing. The action plans call for allocating an additional $10 million to build units that serve those who are homeless or at imminent risk of homelessness,  And we will put special emphasis on permanent housing for people with severe mental illness who are homeless, including those who are accessing the soon-to-be-opened [ORGANIZATION]."
10_07_2015,homeless,"We do face a housing emergency in our community. And I'm grateful to you, Mayor, and to the members of [ORGANIZATION] for taking this critical step. I know I speak for ORG1 and ORG2 when I say that we will do everything in our power to ensure that your actions [ORGANIZATION] result in real improvements in the lives of the thousands of people who are homeless in our community [TIME]."
10_07_2015,homeless; housing crisis,"First, thank you for your attention and for your support  and your action on our homeless and housing crisis. On [TIME], any night, more than 1,800 women, children, and men sleep outside on our streets, in our parks, under our bridges, and in our doorways. That is 1,800 people too many."
10_07_2015,homelessness,"Our city and our county can do better. Over [ORGANIZATION], we've seen the number of unsheltered women increase by 41%. One out of five children who experienced homelessness in our community [TIME] slept on the streets."
10_07_2015,homelessness,"We know what to do, and now we need the resources to do it. DATE0, we explained our need, put a price tag on that need, and turned those investments into action. The additional investments that came from our requests resulted in an additional 575 more people who ended their homelessness."
10_07_2015,homelessness,"I'll be fairly brief, just a little bit of historical context. I think these emergency measures are a historical  event in our city. I think for the many people in this room and throughout our community that have experienced the trauma of homelessness."
10_07_2015,housing insecurity,"As we've heard, [ORGANIZATION] is facing the highest rental increases in the nation. I think in [ORGANIZATION], in [LOCATION], our DATE2-over-DATE2 rental increase average in [ORGANIZATION] was 15%, and it was the highest in the nation. So we are and we are continuing to experience very, very low vacancy rates, which is creating the true housing insecurity for many, many [ORGANIZATION] renters."
10_07_2015,homelessness,"They are not a panacea to our rental crisis, but they are needed now,  And we must, as a city council, fast track these renter protections. It is also clear to me that tenants need help to enforce their rights. And the mayor and chair [ORGANIZATION]'s plan to fund homelessness assistance, as I said, will involve the creation of a legal services tenant protection team."
10_07_2015,homeless,Okay. Imagine you had a criminal record because you had been once sleeping outside and arrested from these homeless sweeps. Imagine if you had been racially profiled or a victim of this war on drugs that targets African Americans and people of color.
10_07_2015,homelessness,"If you want to see examples of leadership, look to [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] who have committed to housing every homelessness veteran by [ORGANIZATION] with [ORGANIZATION]. Look to Governor [PERSON], who helped champion $62 million for housing in [LOCATION]. Look to Speaker [PERSON], who fought to include tenants with Section 8 as a protected class under the Fair Housing Act and fought to include rentals in this DATE2's inclusionary zoning bill, which ultimately died in the ORG2."
10_07_2015,housing crisis,"DATE0 notice is not enough, either to move quickly or observe a shocking rent increase, especially in [LOCATION]'s disaster-like housing crisis. We will no longer accept that your hands are tied due to explicit or implicit preemption in [ORGANIZATION] state law. If that is the case, then demonstrate the courage and leadership necessary to either change them or challenge them."
10_07_2015,homeless,I want to begin [TIME] by sharing how committed both I and my members are to housing. Our mission statement is promoting quality rental housing. And we were actively involved and continue to be in the ending homeless vet program that [ORGANIZATION] just mentioned.
10_07_2015,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] is a stark example of the failures of rent control. Rents there have dramatically increased, and far fewer affordable housing units have been built there compared to what has been built in [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] works with housing advocates through [ORGANIZATION] to develop important state housing policy and discuss current housing issues, and will continue to do so."
10_07_2015,affordable housing,"Eliminate zoning restrictions that allow only single-family homes in neighborhoods and encourage row houses, triplexes, cottages, and accessory dwelling units for long-term rentals. Waive permit fees for multifamily buildings that can renovate existing space to add additional housing units. Use [ORGANIZATION] funds beyond cost recovery for bond affordable housing, as was recently suggested by Mr. [PERSON]."
10_07_2015,affordable housing,"advocating for additional funding for affordable housing development, such as recording fee surcharges for [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] looks forward to our continued collaboration with the city and state officials, as well as private and nonprofit developers, to increase the supply of affordable housing to our community. Thank you."
10_07_2015,affordable housing,"And, no, seriously, you represent an industry, but every single time this council tried to do something different, like fair housing and affordable housing, you were there. So I want to thank you personally for your work. And I know that you didn't always have the full support of everyone you represented in some of that work, but it's a mark of your leadership that you helped us get some things done."
10_07_2015,affordable housing,"Yeah, we're market rate correct and in that's in the air. We're all affordable housing yes, and during that time  People didn't do anything with their units either. So you have [ORGANIZATION] of deferred maintenance."
10_07_2015,homeless,"And then the second amendment in this same package is just a process by which, if we do proceed and declare an emergency, that the whole council, which is being asked to declare the emergency, is regularly updated on how we're implementing it. So it says the mayor's office shall submit written reports to council offices [ORGANIZATION], providing status updates on efforts to implement the council's directions on the, I should say, housing and homeless emergency. And identifying any further council directives that may be needed."
10_07_2015,homeless,"It's just housing rather than this. Okay, just housing, obviously. Homeless is included in the law."
10_07_2015,homeless,"This is actually from [ORGANIZATION]. She pointed out that the second sentence now says, the request will identify the city seeking assistance regarding state assistance, provision of services. Okay.  for the homeless and health and mental health services and direct state agencies to utilize and employ state personnel, equipment, and facilities for activities designated to alleviate the circumstances giving rise to the emergency for the protection of the health and safety of citizens affected by the emergency."
10_07_2015,homelessness,"The [ORGANIZATION] end homelessness plan that the city implemented [LOCATION] didn't happen. And so this probably won't happen either. There's been a proposal, I think it was [PERSON], there's an article in [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] about this, the ORG1 building."
10_07_2015,affordable housing,"Also, what is so-called affordable housing? I forget who it was saying that so much affordable housing has been created in [ORGANIZATION]. We need to be talking about, quote, this is my term,  that I developed with several other people that are in low-cost housing now, we need very low-cost, non-subsidized housing."
10_07_2015,houseless,"So I would really encourage the other commissioners to follow the mayor's lead on this and work with people who are sleeping outside who are finding shelter, who are doing so in a [STREET] that's not disruptive.  to continue to do so in a safe [STREET]. People that had to leave, there was a pregnant woman, a woman of color that left the [ORGANIZATION] camp in fear of being swept when the [ORGANIZATION] posted a sweep notice [ORGANIZATION]. She had to move into a much less secure scenario because she left a camp that was pretty safe and her partner had all of his possessions stolen by other houseless people."
10_07_2015,homelessness,"And just on that point, because Commissioner [PERSON] said it earlier so succinctly,  [ORGANIZATION] we're seeing cuts to these federal programs under sequestration. And thank goodness [ORGANIZATION] is the only federal agency exempt from sequestration, which is one of the reasons the county and the city can continue to focus on veterans homelessness. It's the one agency of federal government that doesn't get the automatic cut [LOCATION]."
10_07_2015,homeless,"Now, I do have a comment on that. Now, there's a lot of veterans out there that are homeless. Yes."
10_07_2015,homeless,"As Commissioner [PERSON] said, we've got to give [ORGANIZATION] credit. I got a call [ORGANIZATION] from the ORG1 Secretary saying, from [ORGANIZATION] saying, would the city of [ORGANIZATION] sign up?  to get all of our homeless veterans inside. And so we partnered with [PERSON] and our housing authority, ORG2, as well as with the city of [ORGANIZATION] and some nonprofits that we did make that commitment."
10_07_2015,homeless,"And we started out [ORGANIZATION] with 690 homeless veterans, and we're down to about 230, and our goal is to get them all inside by [LOCATION]. And that wouldn't happen if it weren't for [ORGANIZATION], as Commissioner [PERSON] said, stepping up and giving us vouchers. We're housing [DATE] with vouchers."
10_07_2015,homelessness,"The ending homelessness team at [ORGANIZATION] sat down with the ORG1, sat down with the nonprofit providers, and fixed the structural problem with the [LOCATION] vouchers program. And that actually opened the door to us becoming eligible for more vouchers. So a lot of good people worked on that."
10_07_2015,homeless,"But we have to go the extra step.  and change the law. So if that means us going down to the state, then that's what we need to do. And so, but I want to see temporarily for people, I'm working with some ladies who are like right hanging over the cliff, about to be homeless in [ORGANIZATION]."
10_07_2015,homeless,"One of the issues I have is Mr. [PERSON] was a very interesting speaker, and one of the things that I got from his speech was that he stated that there could be a concern of overbuilding the housing inventory.  comparing it to the office from [ORGANIZATION]. Now, when he made that statement, I'd like a little more research on exactly where he thinks the balance is to where we don't have 2,000 to 3,000 homeless people out on the streets and where he thinks it would be considered being overbuilt because, in my opinion, we have a housing shortage. In my opinion, at 2% to 3% vacancy rate,  We need more housing units built."
10_07_2015,affordable housing,"The point is, as a disabled person and being on low income, it's very, the situation is very complex because there are laws that prevent people who receive SSDI from having a certain amount of money to even make to be able to live in an apartment. That is Section 8. That is considered affordable housing."
10_07_2015,affordable housing,I worked over [ORGANIZATION] with [ORGANIZATION]. But I found affordable housing. I put my $50 deposit down.
10_07_2015,affordable housing,"It's on FAC0. They have 75 apartments, 15 are affordable housing. The regular rent starts at $2,000."
10_07_2015,affordable housing,I'm stuck because they found a loophole to not accept me.  because of this cosigner so okay what do I do now because I don't have a cosigner that makes almost 5 000 a month but this is affordable housing that I'm applied for  Okay.
10_07_2015,affordable housing,"And you are doing that by bringing down barriers to building more affordable housing, and we applaud you and want to help you with that. Thank you. Thank you very much."
10_07_2015,affordable housing,"Commissioner [PERSON], I appreciate that. And I think that you'll find that my organization has been at the table on the Section 8, on the affordable housing issues. We've been there."
10_07_2015,homeless,"My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I represent [PERSON]. I'm here to speak just on the declaration of emergency ordinance before you and to say that we very much appreciate this ordinance coming forward. As you know, for some time we've been saying we have a crisis on our streets and in our parks with the homeless population."
10_07_2015,homeless,"So we've had at this point about 3,300 community members sign on to that. They're mothers, fathers, citizens, some actual homeless people that have signed on in support of that. So we think this is a good first step."
10_07_2015,affordable housing,"My name is [ORGANIZATION]. As we sit here, your partner and your partner and your partner. your partner and [PERSON] your partner my former landlord [ORGANIZATION] has been keeping the entire five apartment complex at [ADDRESS] vacant for [ORGANIZATION] an affordable housing landlord provider now when I spoke with this the last time I had a candid conversation with [PERSON] it was DATE1"
10_07_2015,affordable housing,"You folks have done nothing but cause this problem. Maybe you should go to the auto parts store where they say, poor planning on your part does not make an emergency on our part. Now, none of you has the backbone to go out here and get on the number six bus and go up to FAC0 on FAC1 and go one block and see that fiveplex that's been vacant for over $100,000 of affordable housing rent."
10_07_2015,affordable housing,"Right now, the landlord that you're funding right now with your [ORGANIZATION], the one that has an executive director reserve parking space and cares more about that than as you do than getting people into the affordable housing stock that we currently have. You have no emergency. You have no backbone."
10_07_2015,affordable housing,"What's going to happen to me, because I really need to stay in [ORGANIZATION] for my medical issues, and there's no [STREET]. Section 8 allows, in my zip code, 1,050 for a two-bedroom, and they're going up to 1,295, so they're going [STREET] above the allowance. That's going to leave me in a very unsafe position, and...  As you've heard many times, the waiting list for affordable housing is too long, plus my income."
10_07_2015,affordable housing,"If, like that one woman stated, if you need a cosigner, my income is not going to get me into the affordable housing. So although all these amendments are up there, they're great, [ORGANIZATION], I agree with all of that. We really need to start moving."
10_07_2015,homelessness,"Thank you very much. Welcome, sir. Yes, my name is [ORGANIZATION], and I've came here several times over [ORGANIZATION] to address the homelessness in the north and northeast."
10_07_2015,homeless; homelessness,"And at that time, I came here to the city council back in [ORGANIZATION], I believe, and there they gave me some property over on FAC0 that we would have turned into a [INSTITUTION]. As they said, the homeless and the black have raised 44% DATE1 alone because now they're equipped  couch searching and fighting amongst themselves, they're starting to come out and let the city know that there has been homelessness. Now they want the city to address their homelessness because they see the city is really taking their land from their mothers and their fathers, their uncles and everything."
10_07_2015,housing crisis,and and it doesn't solve anything right now but it gives us the flexibility to do some things we couldn't do before and therefore it is a necessary precondition to doing some things we want to do and it is my sense going around the community that the number one issue facing our city and i hear this from everywhere i go in our city is the housing crisis and in [ORGANIZATION]  I could not have said that before.
10_07_2015,homelessness,"And I was really inspired over the course of [ORGANIZATION] by what we've accomplished with veterans' homelessness. It is proof that we can make change. and that we can focus on a problem, bring people together, and make a difference, get people into housing who deserve it."
10_07_2015,homelessness,"And then finally, we can, I think, with the support of a lot of people in this community, stop [ORGANIZATION].  demonizing homelessness and understand its causes while still preserving safe streets. There are a lot of people suffering from compassion fatigue in our city who call on me [ORGANIZATION] to clean out that mess. And I understand that homelessness causes terrible side effects."
10_07_2015,affordable housing,"We don't have the option the federal government has, which is to cut military spending, where we spend almost as much in our military as the rest of the world combined. So that's another reason I'm grumpy about the federal government's lack of initiative on this issue. Another point I think is important to make is that in a normal property tax structure, the fact that the value of housing in [ORGANIZATION] is going up, which would mean that we'd have a lot more property tax revenue to spend on things like affordable housing,  Because of Measure 50 passed in [ORGANIZATION], the value of a property can only go up for tax purposes by 3% a year no matter how much it's going up in actuality."
10_07_2015,homeless,"There were 55 people that would do that. It's easy to put that together and –  It would take up all the homeless people in [ORGANIZATION], I feel. Well, I'm glad you're considering it as you can, please."
11_30_2016,homeless,"One of those killed was [PERSON] and a veteran, and at least three were homeless. So it's not a great measure of reduction of police use of force. The mayor also likes to claim that he's fired more officers than his predecessors, but according to the [ORGANIZATION] records, he's only fired three in [ORGANIZATION], and there were six under Mayor [PERSON]."
11_30_2016,homeless,These are the types of violations of human rights that [ORGANIZATION] is involved in through its sale of the D9 weaponized bulldozer. Our city should not be invested in companies making a profit that leaves families homeless. Our city should not be invested in a company that is [ORGANIZATION] profiting from the destruction of sacred ground and [ORGANIZATION].
11_30_2016,homelessness,"But [ORGANIZATION] also is a major developer and researcher of health care advancements, of...  water, agricultural, and solar resource saving and of much good. If we decrease our income in this city, then what does that do to addressing homelessness, which is a desperate, socially responsible obligation that you have to, among others. I respect your listening."
11_15_2018,affordable housing,"It's a special [STREET] for our city, for our region, for our state. It's the densest concentration of people and jobs in [ORGANIZATION] and just 3% of the city's land area. Home to cultural institutions, major employers, half of the city's affordable housing stock, key social services."
11_15_2018,homeless,"They're paying the costs that we are incurring through rents, which then trickle down to the rest of the economy, to our renters in the area, all the [STREET] down to serving the homeless population, which we've been paying and bearing the burden of the cost, the 1% new construction tax that's funding some of these projects. And so our concern is just that we make sure that we're really looking at the freight and the impact to the businesses. If the businesses get charged more, they either aren't viable, we don't have viable streets where we have places for pedestrians to go, and we do want pedestrian traffic to our businesses, but we also need to make sure that we're serving them and their economic needs to stay viable."
12_09_2015,homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION] has done exemplary work as the executive director of [ORGANIZATION]. His [STREET] to work with the faith community to end the cycles of homelessness, poverty, and helping underserved communities through this initiative is an inspiring model of public service that [ORGANIZATION] sought to acknowledge through this award. And [ORGANIZATION] is here to tell us more about [ORGANIZATION] on this award."
12_09_2015,homelessness,"And so our board takes great pride in being able to present these extraordinary candidates that we have presented for [ORGANIZATION] that his legacy continues to live on. [ORGANIZATION] is the founder and executive director of [ORGANIZATION]. It's a nonprofit whose purpose is that all people should achieve their full and human potential, and whose mission is to engage faith communities in ending the cycle of homelessness."
12_09_2015,homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION], a former Greek Orthodox priest, was inspired to apply his energy to the persistent issue of homelessness. After his experiences with the [ORGANIZATION] program, which offered Greek cooking classes for people transitioning out of homelessness, he saw the willingness of faith communities to help and saw the opportunity to serve more people through better collaboration between the faith communities. He, along with others working on this issue, proceeded to create a network of congregations, supporting efforts to give those in need a more sure-footed path out of homelessness."
12_09_2015,homeless,"In [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] started [ORGANIZATION] as a project at [ORGANIZATION], a local homeless services nonprofit. [ORGANIZATION] officially became its own nonprofit in [LOCATION]. Like this award's namesake, [ORGANIZATION] is also a nonfiction author."
12_09_2015,homelessness,"He translated on social justice [ORGANIZATION] Great, a collection of homilies of [ORGANIZATION] of [ORGANIZATION], a DATE0 Christian figure who founded a center called [PERSON]. That was dedicated to healing the whole person. [PERSON]'s interfaith curriculum on homelessness has been used by dozens of congregations in the [LOCATION] area."
12_09_2015,homelessness,"In [ORGANIZATION], he received the Lamplighter Award from [ORGANIZATION] for his organizing work in the faith community around family homelessness. A little bit about his background, which is quite extensive. [ORGANIZATION] in English, [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]."
12_09_2015,homelessness,"[PERSON], which is [ORGANIZATION]. ORG2 [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION], he instituted a program to connect people experiencing isolation in their community as a result of illness, age, and other factors. ORG3, which is [LOCATION], in partnership with [ORGANIZATION], this GPE2-based nonprofit agency supporting people experiencing homelessness in their efforts to end homelessness."
12_09_2015,homelessness,"And with the effort of [ORGANIZATION] has instituted a series of Greek cooking classes designed for people transitioning out of homelessness. Thank you. This program has grown to include a [ORGANIZATION] reunion of gatherings, job skills training, and a program whereby graduates mentor new students."
12_09_2015,homelessness,"And [ORGANIZATION], the housing commissioner at the time, had invited me to come down and basically say hello and present myself to the community [ORGANIZATION]. That relationship turned into a series of conversations between myself, Commissioner [PERSON], and [ORGANIZATION], who is here [ORGANIZATION]. I'm really honored to have him here, about faith community involvement in ending homelessness."
12_09_2015,homelessness,"We started, as was mentioned before, the [ORGANIZATION] program, a Greek cooking class for people making the transition out of homelessness. And really very early on, what we recognized was that we were doing a lot more than teaching cooking. That great acronym, [ORGANIZATION], we realized afterwards that there was a word that was left out of it."
12_09_2015,homelessness,"The C should have been for community. Because we recognized that what we were really doing was helping people who had experienced the tremendous isolation and dislocation of homelessness to rebuild a sense of community and to have a [STREET] where they really belonged. So in [ORGANIZATION], and it's almost to the day now, in [ORGANIZATION], I made a series of decisions that led to me stepping down as the priest of [ORGANIZATION] and ultimately starting [ORGANIZATION] project, first at [ORGANIZATION] and then [ORGANIZATION] nonprofit."
12_09_2015,homelessness,"When Commissioner [PERSON], after he stepped down from the council, he wrote a white paper shortly afterward called A Human Connection that I go back to from time to time where he talked about the importance of community and relationships. And to me, this has always been something that I think about in terms of how can the faith community be involved in a more rich and varied [STREET] in this challenge of ending homelessness. How can we provide that village of support that people need so that they can surmount their challenges and be the most successful that they possibly can be?"
12_09_2015,homelessness,"So much of the learning has been about community, has been about the importance of relationships, and how can the faith community take the lead in creating a more compassionate community? Because in my opinion, homelessness will not be ended by more or bigger or better programs, although programs are very important. [PERSON] will be ended by...  through the creation of a more compassionate community, a community where everyone recognizes that they have a role, so that it's not just the purview of the public sector or of the nonprofit sector."
12_09_2015,homeless; homelessness,"And what opportunities are we creating to make it possible for those who want to help to actually be able to do something in a productive [STREET]? I think another huge learning in this process has been thinking about the upstream causes and where exactly should we be focusing energy and attention. We've started working over [ORGANIZATION], since [LOCATION], focusing more specifically on homeless families just because we recognize that for so many of these families, there is a generational and intergenerational cycle of poverty and of homelessness that repeats."
12_09_2015,homelessness,"And so how can we focus energy and attention and resources on those children who are at the highest risk for the worst outcomes? I think that  as we think broadly about homelessness, we have to think about things like how do we raise the high school graduation rate? How do we help these families with children  and the children in particular to avail themselves of what really is the number one best anti-poverty strategy that has ever been invented, which is finish high school and go to college."
12_09_2015,homeless,That's that transition I was talking about from taking care of homeless people to picking up the trash. Second reading.
12_09_2015,affordable housing,"Well, with these next three votes, we're bringing online 82 additional units of affordable housing. I want to thank, in particular, [ORGANIZATION] and PERSON1 at ORG0 for all their work on this program to make it successful, more successful. Aye."
12_09_2015,affordable housing,"PERSON0? Aye. PERSON1? Aye. You know, people wonder what are we doing to promote affordable housing, and my crack staff have noticed here – my excellent staff, I shouldn't use that term – my excellent staff noted that the city will forego $1.5 million of revenue over the [ORGANIZATION] period for this tax exemption."
12_20_2017,homeless,"I don't want to echo what the other two speakers have said so far and I'd like to add that you know I'd like it if the police would you know stop harassing homeless people for you know the crime of not having a [STREET] to sleep and um  Yeah, that's it. Thank you. Thank you for my time."
11_06_2019,homeless,"It's about your [ORGANIZATION] agency targeting a homeless family that was awarded domestic violence funds recently by the state because you guys, the city of [ORGANIZATION], are the perpetrators against a homeless family. PERSON0 and his family, they're living in a school bus. in [PERSON] and you guys repeatedly targeted them for [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] until the state recently awarded them domestic violence funds to lead the state?"
11_06_2019,homeless,"No war but class war when you used to act like you were a little radical? Well, now you are the class war against the homeless. You've joined the oligarchy."
11_06_2019,houseless,"This means that houses are now hand disassembled, materials are salvaged for use, and in turn these materials can be used in everything from sleeping pods for the houseless to handcrafted furniture and finishes that are showcased in our restaurants and coffee houses and elsewhere. Again, it's all about sustainability. Deconstruction also nourishes our continuing initiative to build a circular economy where we move away from a linear model of using something once and then throwing it out and having it go to the landfill, instead finding ways to creatively reuse materials."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"And I'd like to note that [ORGANIZATION] has suggested adding an exemption from the deconstruction requirements for houses that are removed for the purpose of constructing affordable housing. Reducing the cost of affordable housing are important, and so too are the benefits of deconstruction. And with that lens, [PERSON] and ORG2 explored the concept and implications of such an exemption."
11_06_2019,houseless,"We cannot honestly say we are concerned about the houseless, the displaced, or even high rents if we demolish homes in the name of density rather than supporting reuse of homes to provide increased housing that people can afford."" We are eliminating opportunities for the disenfranchised communities, young families, and our elders to become or remain independent rather than be forced into higher cost apartments instead of fixer uppers. If we hide behind our deconstruction ordinance to cover up what we are doing to our housing and our communities, we have nothing to brag about."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"I hope you will save that speech and come and give it again when we do the residential infill project, because I think it's a very important point. I want to thank PERSON0 and [PERSON] and all of the folks who have been participating in [LOCATION] for now [ORGANIZATION]. and this was an alliance of neighborhood associations from across coalitions who came to council with the not unreasonable request that homes should not be demolished with sprinkling lead and asbestos all over the neighborhood there were those who said these are just nimbys although actually it's okay to not want asbestos and lead in your backyard there were those who said it was that folks were against affordable housing that all kinds of um unkind at best comments were made and you persisted."
11_06_2019,homeless,"Hi. [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]. DATE0, I went online and I saw the number of abandoned residential buildings in arrears on their taxes were in the hundreds."
11_06_2019,homeless,"in a landfill where it's going to be open and it's going to be rained on and it's going to leach into water. So I think we need to pay attention to that because that's a health issue for people. And then the other thing I would like to say is I would encourage homeowners that want to deconstruct, please consider donating or having homeless people come in and take apart your wood and let them make a tiny home with it."
11_06_2019,homeless,"And also these... properties that you guys are going to reclaim are you know, I've talked to [ORGANIZATION] and what they want to do is this multi-generational duplexes. But that leaves out single disabled people who are aging no matter what their color or their gender. And I think there's a lot of discrimination against single people."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"DATE0, please. DATE0, authorize an intergovernmental agreement with [ORGANIZATION] for the transfer of $4 million from the [ORGANIZATION] Supportive Housing Fund to ORG1 for development of 70 housing units at ORG2. DATE2, [PERSON] voters made history by passing our first ever affordable housing bond."
11_06_2019,homeless,"Their $4 million capital contribution for FAC0 and additional support services through [ORGANIZATION] advances our goal of bringing new permanent supportive housing units into our community. And with that, I'll turn this over to [ORGANIZATION]. It looks like you're up first, [ORGANIZATION], and then PERSON1 will play second fiddle [ORGANIZATION]."
11_06_2019,homelessness,"It will provide 100 new homes, 70 of which will provide supportive housing. All of the 70 units with supportive housing will have rent support from home forward. The majority of the residents will be individuals transitioning from homelessness who experience a disabling condition."
11_06_2019,homeless,"So, Mayor and Commissioners, good morning. My name is [ORGANIZATION] and I'm the Director of [ORGANIZATION]. I'm mostly here just to express my appreciation for the partnership that this represents between the City and the County when it comes to expanding the inventory of permanent supportive housing in our community."
11_06_2019,homelessness; housing crisis,"And it turns out that over [ORGANIZATION], as the public has become more, focused on the housing crisis and focused on homelessness. But the public actually understands that for this to be successful, you've got to have those services. And furthermore, interesting, understands that having a case worker and those services might be the difference between a successful tenancy or not."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"Thank you, Mayor, and thank you so much for your presentation. This has nothing to do with what's in front of me at the moment, but I continue to say to both of you that what we're calling affordable housing is really not affordable housing. So while [ORGANIZATION] Commissioner [PERSON] is talking about affordable housing, are 30% and below MFI."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"Do you have any data on the people who are being turned away because they can't afford the affordable housing units that are coming on the market? I mean, when we talk 80% of MFI, when we talk 60% of MFI, do we have any data at all? Are we collecting that data?"
11_06_2019,affordable housing,So you're able to see the gap. That's often how we're able to identify what the deficit is of deeply affordable housing in our community for that population. So I can also forward you that information.
11_06_2019,affordable housing,And I don't know that I have that. information. We definitely have the need in the community and it is definitely the deeply affordable housing for folks DATE0.
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"When we are talking about affordable housing here with [ORGANIZATION], we're talking about big A affordable as defined by [ORGANIZATION]. When other people are talking about affordable housing, they may just be talking about housing that's affordable to anyone relative to their income, which is 30%. That's the rule of thumb, 30% of your income."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"We have to follow [ORGANIZATION] guidelines, is my understanding. And... When we're talking about publicly owned housing, permanently affordable housing, we are devoting our dollars to 60% of MFI and below."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"Sure. In keeping with what you just said, there was a time when [ORGANIZATION] and the then version of [ORGANIZATION], which had a different name, a big disagreement about what was affordable housing. Dollars were being spent differently depending on which of the two agencies were spending the dollars."
11_06_2019,homeless,"But what we're proposing doing is replacing it with a building that will actually last. for [ORGANIZATION], unlike the building that is there currently. And it will also provide support services to ensure that the chronically homeless can be successful in their housing."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"They're also regulating more by building scale, more flexibility for affordable housing to really be more intentional with a big emphasis on bonuses, development incentives, and the mix. While we're also looking at trying to get more clearly affordable housing as an option, we're also thinking about how the new housing relates both to while we're looking at focusing on expanding housing. So we have a number of provisions that are expanding outdoor space with the needs of residents and the surrounding context."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"And just to highlight those development bonus and they're also community design related right to development bonuses Almost all of the development bonuses says when we talk about our amendments and relationships priority placed on more deeply affordable housing affordable are about affordable housing and with the greatest and that's a level that's about where a preschool teacher at a 60 percent of area median income level security guard we know that our private sector is an urns or a landscaper or is one reason for that priority That would be not producing a lot of new housing at that level. So that's that's Amendment number one is related to that deep transitioning straightaways into the amendment as written. It focuses on that 60% of area median income housing affordability amendment, which [ORGANIZATION] has its half of the units have to be at that level."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"But the intent really is to, and [ORGANIZATION] from housing will talk about rental housing, but also to expand opportunities for affordable ownership. Use this bonus not only to promote related to this, and I'll talk about this more when we get to the discussion of housing. And there are three amendments related to an existing affordable housing parking exemption."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"primarily in the multi-dwelling and mixed-use zones to help reduce any affordable housing projects getting more affordable housing built. And just a key to reduce the costs and increase the feasibility of multi-dwelling and mixed-use zones are within [TIME] of frequent transit. Note is that 95%, the vast majority of our multi-dwelling, relate to very far from transit."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"This policy has been turned into a polarizing issue of historic districts in the current draft. Through a similar scenario with the mandatory affordable housing, and as a former Seattleite, we went vice of split between the [ORGANIZATION] and the YIMBYs. Housing legislation, which created a difference."
11_06_2019,housing crisis; affordable housing,"Context from statistics from [ORGANIZATION] of a net loss of over 400 low-income units that showed demolitions alone led to smaller. The bottom line, there needs to be more tools. Furthermore, the new units were more expensive, specifically around the loss of existing naturally in the toolbox to address our affordable housing crisis."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"As importantly, if not more, the issue of displacement and acquiring affordable housing, and this is the incentive for seismic retrofits. Demolition disincentive is one tool. I don't like being boxed into a label of a [ORGANIZATION]."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"Ideally, any increase in zone density should be to provide housing and cellwood for the typical Portlander. A minimum increased density should not contribute to economics dedicated to affordable housing. And as you have to incentivize affordable housing or building size and number segregation."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,Affordable housing is to first double the current [PERSON]. Our proposal to strengthen the incentive to build and second allow development that provides affordable housing unit density for market rate development. Limited units is now proposed by [ORGANIZATION].
11_06_2019,affordable housing,To have the size bonus. and an incentive to build affordable housing and compatibility with density. Benefits of our proposal include increasing [ORGANIZATION] report summary and proposed by the residential infill project.
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"Thanks all three of you. To further incentivize affordable housing. PERSON0, [PERSON]."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"I generally support [ORGANIZATION]. And thanks for the opportunity to testify. Amendments, which will help to increase the supply of affordable housing."
11_06_2019,homelessness,"For [ORGANIZATION], to allow single-room occupancy buildings by preventing homelessness by serving as inexpensive, unsubsidized houses, these SROs have played a major role. But as you know, most SROs have disappeared, as they say, for very low-income singles and couples. [ORGANIZATION] has rightly started to recognize the zones where they're allowed have grown more expensive, meaning ones downtown."
11_06_2019,homeless,"This Regulative Better Housing by Design makes SROs a segment of urgently needed housing for the homeless. The regulatory barrier pointlessly obstructs development, but they'd still allow a little more socioeconomic diversity. SROs in the RM1 zone would be relatively small."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"We'd also like to thank FAC0, which I would like to point out is an ex-M2 for the property on [ORGANIZATION], purposed as affordable housing, and it has the full support of the law. This is an example of how a historic property can be repurposed. M5 and [LOCATION] that strive for compatible with [PERSON]."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"idea that seems to be circulating that we have to choose between object to a pernicious idea of developing affordable housing. I think that is based on an utterly false meaning, the historic fabric of our communities and of... Some of the most vulnerable historic homes and buildings are in under-assumption, and we can do both, and we must."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"I think we need to have the ability to make those kinds of sacred, for sure. But unreinforced masonry buildings that have been seismically upgraded have been converted into thoughtful decisions about where their opacity really matters within that community and in whatever affordable housing. And have or continue to serve in whatever."
11_06_2019,homeless,"A national study on the precipice or housing insecure. Community college students are homeless and 44% further away from the investments we've made in education. As housing prices continue to rise, our students are moving from community college, meaning that community college is not in fact in their community and is commuting [TIME] to get to their local community."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"It is meant to solve some of those issues. beyond maybe any longer and programs like better housing by design [ORGANIZATION] we might be partners with you in building affordable housing value that this will bring to our city we also hope it forward to the ability to think creatively the [STREET] that in [ORGANIZATION] and we look very much from being part of the solution. Thank you, and thanks for the proposal."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"You are attributing it to a lack of affordable housing. We will have campus-specific data from that same center, and that study did include [ORGANIZATION] data. And in [ORGANIZATION], I believe and understand what you're saying, that it's a complex issue and we shouldn't attribute it."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"parking lots, infill buildings, but at a handout they got that gives you an idea of review for development and I've provided an excellent infill project that is great for the neighborhood that does give an example of a [ORGANIZATION] building as opposed to the second one, but and actually demolishes as a night an existing triplex and This would, again, which is next to a parking lot, which would demolish or a contributing building, which is also currently affordable housing and incentivize the demolition of a historic building. I think what we're looking there is to ensure that we have housing by its historic right. So I develop that."
11_06_2019,housing crisis,"Are we doing more? to items, amendments number one, numbers three, four, and for [ORGANIZATION] people that are suffering under our current housing crisis to establish to the people prioritizing affluent and historically advanced and prioritizing buildings to take a moment and search advantaged communities. And I really beg you, in a paper about how we failed [ORGANIZATION]."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"First, this is an FAR transfers for sites that have a that encourages affordable housing and seismic upgrades through funds of foul of the recently entitled bonus and transfer assistance is not just a give me, it was a fundamental, very well considered bonus system. The bonus actually develop the number of affordable housing units, then an offset allowing those properties to act. Amendment would then be an increased burden to realizing that density and that are envisioned by the city."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"And the affordable housing units are the most important. The other thing is transit will follow density. This is already, to be clear, an existing height element of that."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"And I've been working on a couple of things like affordable housing units or other amenities for that to accommodate the outdoor area as well. Well, that's what I'm saying. You would have to have projects where we're even having a real challenge to the injury of the indoor space, which also doesn't just have less outdoor space."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"The project has also provided a competitive advantage for regulated affordable homes. It makes climate change seriously by reducing or eliminating minimum parking requirements across the board. The project to increase bonuses for regulated affordable housing now expanded to 50% with a focus on affordable housing, has steadily added a transfer of development rights that will help preserve existing affordable housing above baseline allowances, and create... pertaining to the amendments housing without losing housing capacity overall how affordable homeownership projects to access the deeper affordability I support amendment 1a to allow to that would allow affordable housing projects where I've bonus I also support I think it's amendment"
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"Both routes and frequency, bike routes, pedestrian, to the non-profit affordable housing providers that have testified. Lastly, please listen. Amendment would have the unintended consequence of decreasing the number of homes in most cases."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"The neighbors in [ORGANIZATION] who were committed to Affordable Housing Act. And what we understood was that things that initially came out of this, which were, I think, much grander than we were very interested in seeing the types of, even as we have a world-class planning bureau, innovations like scale basis we have [ORGANIZATION]. One of the issues that we're facing in placement and foregrounding anti-displacement in our policies is this equivocation, zoning, rethinking in terms of anti-displacement."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"And so I just want to echo, including, pro-affordable housing organization need to coalesce and build new organizations. And working with neighborhoods who have come to the table for [ORGANIZATION] since working with anti-displacement organizations, working with tenant, these are certain things that are proposed but who've been thinking carefully over the [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]. Not once this has come up in the ORG0 proposal and I want us to create more housing options for how about our more sustainable future."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"Thank you, appreciate it. For the general direction of [ORGANIZATION], and I'm also here to voice my my support removing minimum parking requirements for projects that uh but in particular to strongly endorse amendment two sorry my mic seems unreliable i should say actually include affordable housing i should say fur six inches away is about wonderful they're touchy"
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"Right. And if it's not bedrooms out for an exorbitant amount of money, then that means it's market rate housing. And the market will be in build as affordable housing."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"I want more incomes, and that's just not true. And if you have been around for [ORGANIZATION], there were many as affluent and not sensitive to people with low income than the other people you've heard [LOCATION] that were fighting for preserving of us With ardent voices just like some area around for the very purpose of saving buildings and maintaining housing in the alphabet district and turning that established there continues [LOCATION]. Many affordable housing there and a lot of the affordable housing that was a start and that also kind of helped form the foundation of the owners and residents banded together."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"District serves to preserve a slice of [ORGANIZATION]'s history and accommodates house neighborhood associations. [DATE], we have income levels. And I have to say, I've worked [ORGANIZATION] in the affordable housing tools with a mix of income levels, many at lower income."
11_06_2019,homelessness; affordable housing,And I think it's important to really look at what we're doing when we're zoning field and have worked on homelessness and other things in affordable housing. So [ORGANIZATION] is very dense with a population that's someplace to protect people that are currently in a foreign. It's a really dense area.
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"They have a median income 31% higher, even though they've, and if you just compare that to [ORGANIZATION] to our east where there are This is partly due to the amount of home forward housing, integrated affordable housing. There's some low income housing that show where section eight certificates are concentrated. We have a large concentration of non-profit housing units in the alphabet district and if you look at buildings."
11_06_2019,homelessness,"We see 500 a month that was going to be demolished and redeveloped that had 14 units. that rented for $1,500 a month and be a basement unit that's very small. And in my mind, the most affordable unit would be renting at $30,000 and discouraging homelessness."
11_06_2019,homelessness; affordable housing,"That's homelessness in the making. When you just mind as a person who's advocated for affordable housing, it's much more expensive. Thank you."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"Some of the amendments offer form founder obviously I'm most excited about amendment two which will ensure that they did affordable housing as Portlanders for parking were for more homes in the service of storing more cars. There, the building never has to forego space two of a trio of apartments in [ORGANIZATION]. And a number of projects in [LOCATION], a few dozen feet from the transit proximity threshold, proposed building at [ORGANIZATION], which have been just costly exemptions, other workarounds, or build expensive parking."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"And as a result, those developments have had to either pursue with all the problems that those cars bring. With Amendment 2 as part of this meeting that invites more cars into our city to defend their choice to build parking instead of affordable housing package, the onus will now be on the developer for a new project. So thank you."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"Good [TIME]. Good [TIME]. I support Commissioner [PERSON]'s amendment that will section 8 renter in [LOCATION], [PERSON], will protect some of the most affordable housing in key buildings have apartments that are one half, many of LOC2 three to six story historic buildings outside of [PERSON]."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"Thank you, Commissioner, the price per square foot, then in the new low income residents with amendments that help save the frets. For joining [ORGANIZATION] and protect hearing on this topic, I testified that people have the wrong eye on affordable housing. At the last, because it is not a high income area."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"The occurring affordable housing of mid-rise live in [ORGANIZATION] and the naturally been converted into apartments. new apartment buildings, and big old houses that are a heritage center, restore [ORGANIZATION], and [ORGANIZATION] joins the architecture to support Commissioner [PERSON]'s amendments to ORG1 in asking you for [ORGANIZATION] to reduce incentives as the zoning to RM-free historic buildings. to forbid developers to transfer to demolish affordable housing in his national register and to lower heights within a thousand far from when they demolished a building on the [PERSON] and would cause demolitions."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"Increased speed of [ORGANIZATION] stations, which touch part of FAC0 stations, would de-incentivize people wanting to live near building heights for dwellings around [ORGANIZATION] availability. When [ORGANIZATION] asked for these things, public transportation because of loss of living in our neighborhood. We are asking you to protect the most affordable housing."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"We support Commissioner [PERSON]'s amendments, which will help census neighborhoods in all of [ORGANIZATION]. We have [ORGANIZATION] mid-rise historic apartments, which are some of [LOCATION] most affordable housing. And LOC2 is one of the densest neighborhoods in all of [ORGANIZATION]."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"When we ask to right-size the zoning within 1,000 feet of a [ORGANIZATION] station, we are asked to restrict up-zoning on historic district and office spaces. [ORGANIZATION] is looking to protect some of our most affordable apartments and maintain our most affordable housing in [LOCATION]. We've studied predominantly mid-rise apartments that can be parts of [LOCATION]."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"So we support and already have incredibly high-dent, to right size, a very small section of FAC0 that's demolished. Commissioner [PERSON]'s amendment 5 feet in height from RM4 close to RM3 is only a difference of 20 feet by disincentivizing their demolition. But this will protect our most affordable housing, 100-foot allowance within 1,000 feet of the [ORGANIZATION] station."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"This card, they always linger in [ORGANIZATION] and those charming old buildings also hold, this is part of the charm that draws millions for many reasons. [ORGANIZATION] is booming with development. Most affordable housing, so they're worth saving."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"They're soon to build apartments. This new development, we have 1,600 units that recently built from Commissioner [PERSON]'s amendments. We hope you will join more than offsets, a very small reduction in zoning, three amendments to protect the most affordable housing."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,there's no reason to limit or penalize the floor... we should be allowing bonuses for how affordable housing ever is and what council approved I oppose number of freak charities letter development of affordable housing anywhere to quote a capital tool to prevent displacement I thought that was an interesting head of an area having frequent transit can be a value anyway I oppose number five [STREET] to look at it.
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"We could compromise on that, but otherwise. [ORGANIZATION] has said regarding the outdoor and indoor areas, I note that what [PERSON] for number six will result in a decrease in the number of units and a decrease in that for affordable housing, Amendment [PERSON] does. So, keep the proposed regulations oversized in order to fit these things in the buildings, the shared space requirements."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"That's why the affordable housing bonuses are there. That's why the reductions creates more and more affordable housing. FAR, each is going to bring [ORGANIZATION] more desperately needed homes and parking requirements are there."
11_06_2019,housing crisis,That's why we're shifting from unit count. A current housing crisis where landlords are taking advantage of the lower cost in the midst of our And families spend [ORGANIZATION] looking for a home. Our number one of our home shortage to bully tenants and [PERSON].
11_06_2019,affordable housing,It robs us of a home for a car where you could put a home for a family. That's a smart lesson to affordable housing citywide. Potential housing.
11_06_2019,affordable housing,Amendment 2 ensures that we apply. We should stop requiring new parking for any housing. It makes sense to provide more and more affordable housing on [ORGANIZATION].
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"because demolishing just straight in the wrong direction erecting a movement uh through the amendment through with would uh punish future historic building requires a full [ORGANIZATION] vote i'm unfair and unnecessary and makes for less and less affordable housing prospective tenants for the actions of [ORGANIZATION] that's on our city while rewarding the most affluent affluent. Number four would amendments four and five punish the poorest people in transit starved areas simply by virtue of their living in transit starved [STREET], housing, and prospective tenants in transit deserts. Number four, perpetuate exclusion areas would perpetuate a cycle of everybody that lives in historic district is affluent, but they are more affluent than most."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"It's unfair and unnecessary and means less. Homes, families out of reach just look to have it outside of their homes or we can't find a home in the first [STREET]. There is nothing more urgent than less affordable housing."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"There are families being bullied in price preference that even approaches the importance of getting more and more affordable housing. And no personal aesthetic. Please adopt better housing by design with amendments 1A, 1B, and 2 for our families is worthy of consideration."
11_06_2019,housing crisis,"There's a lot of other things I'm more sad about. I'm really sad to imagine the [ORGANIZATION] house I have being replaced with something newer. That is the through line that many of my peer housing crisis that leads to so many people to sleep on the streets and is going to live dealing with landlords, dealing with the tenant crisis that we're just trying to figure out in their lives how they can afford the first [STREET] that they're so eloquently testifying about earlier."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"These buildings, these older buildings, demolish the very buildings that we've gone to the trouble for affordable housing. We're going to talk about the man house in a second. For communities that are very flexible, they're very adaptable."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"And district of which I am the unpaid for [ORGANIZATION] on the board with SROs. And also have some experience with [ORGANIZATION] to support amendments three, four, with real affordable housing. Although the [ORGANIZATION] group didn't vote on M1, M5, and 6. and each one of those amendments as well."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"Why don't you start? [PERSON]. We're a private, non-profit, affordable housing council."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"While the manhouse site will always be covered by [ORGANIZATION]. We would like to add those additional affordable housing units in the future, allowing the additional affordable housing units for manhouses. selecting our project for the [ORGANIZATION]."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"Please oppose Amendments 3 and [DATE], which would limit the amount of affordable [ORGANIZATION] transfers to within 1,[DATE]00 feet. And oppose Amendment 6, which also impacts the viability of housing, which can be built in many closer neighborhoods, a much more context-specific thing. I wanted to spend the next of affordable housing projects, which I think this can be if you've ever heard of [ORGANIZATION] book, The Uninhabitable Earth, little time reading from, I'm not sure, you probably don't want to read this before bed, but, which I think is a really terrifying read."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"And there's a lot of low-income, quite large, with no parking, and there's already a parking. Two other places that are probably going to be targeted units, and we see it developed. And so I think you need to get re... there's any affordable housing in a brand new building."
11_06_2019,affordable housing,I'm interested in carving out discriminatory policy from housing to commercial. We know that small businesses are also kind of concerned about this shift. But I didn't hear anything about we talk businesses are being priced out of the city of [ORGANIZATION] for more affordable housing units.
11_06_2019,affordable housing,But we're basically going to get about affordable housing and creating this opportunity. I don't have any responsibility for making sure that the commercial industry are free ride. And they're not actually providing a business space that's affordable for us if.
11_06_2019,affordable housing,"What I like about SROs, if done properly, is it ends some of the community building that goes with people sharing. So affordable housing. And it enhances."
09_28_2017,affordable housing,"This is a project that's anticipated to bring approximately 700 units of affordable housing to the city, a high-density mix of employment, new city attractions, including expansion of the park blocks, which is very exciting, and signature connections between [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON], and between FAC0 and FAC1. PERSON0, please call up the first people who have signed up on the list. Each person who signs up has [TIME] to testify."

12_07_2017,homeless,"For those of you who don't know what goes on, but [ORGANIZATION] has let us use for [ORGANIZATION] their main ballroom to host the largest [LOCATION] dinner in all of [ORGANIZATION]. We feed 1,500 homeless people in the beautiful ballroom with statues and our guests really love it. Next door to the ballroom basically is the area in question."
12_07_2017,affordable housing,"business owners, people from high-rises, affordable housing units, all of these residents who do not want to lose this easement. I'm a [ORGANIZATION] resident. My [ORGANIZATION] architectural career included working for [ORGANIZATION] in [PERSON] and working with [PERSON], who have advised [ORGANIZATION] on new pedestrianism and urbanism."
10_06_2016,affordable housing,"For [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] has been battered by jaw-dropping rent hikes and the soaring prices of homes. Add to that the dearth of living wage jobs and the destruction of the [ORGANIZATION] corridor, compounded by the crime that accompanied it, and you can imagine why morale is at an all-time low in [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] needs affordable housing, living wage employment opportunities, and a community gathering spot in FAC0."
10_06_2016,affordable housing,"The FAC0 is a lifeline for [ORGANIZATION], the first injection of vitality into [ORGANIZATION]. It will help change the perception of [ORGANIZATION] as a down-and-out battered community. The FAC0 offers some of what [ORGANIZATION] needs, 16 permanently affordable housing at 60% of median family income, employment opportunities as the retail space becomes occupied, and a town center with something shiny and new to attract tourists."
10_06_2016,affordable housing,"Survival comes first. I became involved in [ORGANIZATION] in part to increase civic engagement, especially in this critical period of growth in [ORGANIZATION]. The [DATE] offers affordable housing and opportunities for living wage employment, factors that give hope to move beyond mere survival into stability, which in turn encourages participation in our ORG1."
10_06_2016,affordable housing,"Follow up and follow through. The city knows the need for affordable housing and living wage employment. [ORGANIZATION] is building 54 new housing units, 16 of which will be permanently affordable at 60% of median family income."
10_06_2016,affordable housing,"So as [ORGANIZATION] has mentioned, you may very well see in your process the neighborhood now reacting to our response to that. And those were all with regards to [ORGANIZATION]. And in conclusion, we'd just like to note that these changes strive to ensure that we can accommodate the expected housing and job growth in ways that advance our community goals, specifically,  For more affordable housing for more livable waves wage jobs and to meet our can't climate action plans So thank you for hearing us out."
10_06_2016,affordable housing,My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I'm here on behalf of [ORGANIZATION]. We encourage council to trade parking requirements for more affordable housing by eliminating minimum parking requirements in the mixed-use zones.
10_06_2016,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION]'s current requirements not only make housing more expensive, but also harder to find. Hundreds of homes may not have been built since [ORGANIZATION], as parking thresholds distort the cost-benefit calculations for new apartment buildings. These requirements will undercut the effectiveness of incentives for affordable housing and any eventual inclusionary zoning rules."
10_06_2016,affordable housing,"Furthermore, [ORGANIZATION] modeling revealed that additional required parking may limit utilization of the affordable housing bonus due to high cost of providing structured or underground parking. As most [ORGANIZATION] can testify, off-[STREET] parking minimums also fail in their attempted goal of making curbside parking convenient. We can require developers to build garages, but we cannot require people to pay to park in them."
10_06_2016,affordable housing,"The only [STREET] to make curbside parking more convenient in a busy neighborhood is to charge more for it. If the city prices its permits and meters properly, developers will be forced to provide adequate but not excessive off-[STREET] parking, as the [ORGANIZATION] plan asks, in new buildings without the city having to guess what that level is. Trade parking requirements for more affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]."
10_06_2016,affordable housing,"And I chose a building specifically because it didn't have car parking, because I didn't want to have to pay for the maintenance and maintaining car parking since we didn't own a car. So I'm here to testify against our support eliminating parking minimums in mixed-use zones because I think that it will increase affordable housing and better development around the city and encourage more people to use other means of transportation. Thank you."
10_06_2016,affordable housing,"Our request is supported by Policy 9.58 in the Comprehensive Plan. Parking requirements have exacerbated [ORGANIZATION]'s affordability crisis by adding significant costs to development and limiting housing supply. A recent [ORGANIZATION] report states that parking requirements generally impose an undue burden on housing development, particularly for transit-oriented or affordable housing."
10_06_2016,affordable housing,"We can either build a city that puts housing for people first or a city that puts storage for private automobiles first. Trade parking requirements for more affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION], eliminate minimum parking requirements in mixed-use zones. Thank you."
10_06_2016,affordable housing,"Supposedly, the city wants to create affordable housing, a very laudable goal. In fact, what is happening in our neighborhood where housing,  there is already R25 zoning or they manage to get a zone change or a lot line uh change is that expensive housing is created one unit a perfectly affordable wonderful middle class old DATE0 bungalow is torn down and two behemoths are building its [STREET] and each of those is  sometimes twice as expensive as the one house that was torn down. I have...  many examples of canvas the neighborhood this is what's happening in the real world I hope you can see this it is with my written testimony this is a darling little bungalow on FAC0 it was amazingly sold to a developer for [DATE] [STREET] over market  What was built in its [STREET] is two lovely modern-style homes, taller than the rest of the neighborhood, completely out of character."
10_06_2016,affordable housing,[ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]. good [TIME] mayor [PERSON] and commissioners for the record my name is PERSON3 i'm with [ORGANIZATION] we're a statewide association of affordable housing and community development non-profits also on a personal note i've been a homeowner in [ORGANIZATION] since [ORGANIZATION]. so first off i just want to appreciate the incredibly hard work of staff and the volunteers on ORG1 and everyone involved in this massive and historic project  I'm here [LOCATION] to ask you to support changes that will encourage density and the development of affordable housing wherever possible.
10_06_2016,affordable housing,And this would allow for mixed use projects that could include density bonuses for affordable housing. This would help with avoiding additional displacement of African American residents and businesses. The second piece is asking you to oppose the down zoning of [ORGANIZATION].
10_06_2016,affordable housing,I believe Commissioner [PERSON] alluded to this in his comments earlier. This is a swath of about 27 blocks of [ORGANIZATION] that would be down zoned from the currently allowed 4-1 FAR to 2-1. This would undermine the city's intent to increase the availability of affordable housing and provide equitable access.
10_06_2016,affordable housing,"and i brought to you a proposal that was expensively detailed multi-family housing  We needed a demolition permit, which was not granted by the council, and the conversation [DATE] revolved around two important matters of public policy. One was protection of the historic contributing property there, and the other was the contribution to affordable housing. So with the help of, after that, with the help of [ORGANIZATION], we sat down and worked with [ORGANIZATION], and they are –  they have developed a plan to save that building and to provide 160 units of housing for senior low-income individuals."
10_06_2016,affordable housing,your position in this and and i'm hearing from affordable housing advocates all kinds of people so the question i have is um um timing um assuming the council agree with you what what's what um is northwest housing alternatives under the gun in terms of of the sequencing of of their work on this and development i mean is there is there a is there a time that that  that you and others would prefer we decide this [STREET]? I'm... Let me ask this another [STREET].
10_06_2016,affordable housing,"But that's one part, and the second part is what is the timing issue here? With good luck, that would happen. But we've all been involved in trying to build affordable housing projects."
10_06_2016,affordable housing,"This is an area of [ORGANIZATION] that is proposed to be rezoned from residential to mixed use. In particular, the change includes incentives for developing affordable housing. This can help mitigate the significant displacement that's happened in north and northeast [ORGANIZATION], and it's still happening among historic residents, often lower-income ones of the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood."
10_06_2016,housing crisis,"The neighbors outside my building are also Portlanders. They live in tents, and they sleep on beds of cardboard. We are in a housing crisis."
10_06_2016,affordable housing,"and we obviously have residents who are very concerned about this. We're concerned about this. We think you should be concerned about this, given the importance of affordable housing and the recognition that this is a vital affordable housing resource."
10_06_2016,affordable housing,"In fact, in their own staff report, they quantified that as it would not likely be developed unless the property was redeveloped as a whole. That's different than saying it won't be developed. And secondly, you should be concerned about the idea of proposing something on the anticipation of the redevelopment of an affordable housing resource."
10_06_2016,affordable housing,"So I think that the affordable housing argument is a red herring in this particular case because of the fact that it could never be achieved. So back to the amendment itself, one thing I want to point out is the reason that it's incompatible with, and this is [ORGANIZATION]'s own map, but you'll see that each of these parcels above the green line are the ones that [ORGANIZATION] has recommended changing from 4-1 to 2-1.  Most of them have little black dots in them, you'll see. And those little black dots are historic landmarks."
10_06_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,"We're right near the streetcar, we've got bus routes on FAC0, shopping, restaurants, and a walkability score of 95. Clearly we're in a housing crisis and limiting the ability  to potentially build affordable housing at my location is something that I deem, you know, counterproductive. Um, yeah, I currently am surrounded by, uh, some section eight housing on the, uh, [DATE] and FAC1."
10_06_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,"Now that we have a parking permit system waiting and ready to go, we have a growing housing crisis, and we have [ORGANIZATION] advocating for eliminating parking requirements, this is the time to do that and remove parking requirements for all mixed-use zones projects. We should trade parking requirements for more affordable housing. As a member of ORG1 for the mixed-use zones, I support the CMC 1, 2, and 3 concept, but I'm concerned about the reduced base FARs in those zones."
10_06_2016,affordable housing,"So in some cases, I am affordable housing. I'm able as an individual person to maintain that community and to engage in it. What I'm concerned about is the legislation by headline."
10_06_2016,affordable housing,I think that historic preservation and affordable housing should not be at odds. I think they should work together. They're both important.
10_06_2016,affordable housing,I fully support the affordable housing project that is proposed on the lot across the [STREET] from me that's gotten a lot of media attention. Right. But a development has to comply with applicable zoning requirements and be compatible with the neighborhood.
10_30_2019,homeless,"Preacher, please read the next item. Item 997, request of [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], to address council regarding housing and social services. Good morning."
10_30_2019,homeless,"Okay, so Could you state your name for the record please? [PERSON]. So, um, The contractors, the housing contractors advertise online to the general population and what that does is it makes this home forward flyer that goes to shelters and people who are aging disabled, who are marginalized by gender or race It turns this flyer into fraud because the contractors are allowed through a federal loophole to have their own decide who goes into their housing."
10_30_2019,homeless,"So [PERSON], you know, I think this is charlatanism right here because it takes all of us. He takes this, his campaign manager takes this down to the downtown association. They're not... taking us out to the shelters and saying, hey, you homeless people, come and tell us how it is."
10_30_2019,homeless,"No, they have [ORGANIZATION] go up and give a [TIME] opening address, and then they have a pre-selected homeless person, formerly homeless person, who's going to say how wonderful all the contractors are who are going to present [ORGANIZATION]. Who is the who you're talking about? So that's a finish, and then we can ask questions."
10_30_2019,homeless,"And in the case of safe, no access to laundry or entire bathrooms with disabled access shut down. And the staff have come in with no infectious disease training or CPR training and sometimes they're actually homeless people who have been living in their cars or former heroin addicts or former alcoholics or you know who who are being hired as staff member for disabled people so that leaves a lot of people going out to sleep on the streets because in the shelters there's rampant theft there's bullying on the part of staff and residents and what happened to a guy [TIME] was there's an epidemic of of people stealing stuff while they're sleeping, even though [ORGANIZATION] says it's okay for them to sleep there. And I think that the neighborhood associations have organized an outlaw vigilante thing."
10_30_2019,homelessness,"Yeah, when I first started going to the county board meetings where [ORGANIZATION] is, and I've been to some joint office of homelessness meetings. That's the county. And I'm actually referring to [ORGANIZATION]."
10_30_2019,homelessness,"As you can see on the agenda items, first of all, I guess I should definitely thank... not just the national but especially the local movement called [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] for his testimony, I'd actually thought that there's going to be a huge potential for bridge building. One of the things that [ORGANIZATION] didn't mention is grants that are out there to protect pollinating nature areas and to assure survival for bees, bats, birds that do the essential work of pollination. So I have a feeling we'll be hearing more about that in the future and maybe there's some room for some partnership there as we look at the... the great dearth, the deficit we have in services to help people recover from either homelessness and or addiction."
10_30_2019,affordable housing,"This is cheaper and more environmentally sound. Financial incentives for tiny commercial space along with tiny homes, less square foot, less cost. Space for creativity with nature, encouraging development of green space and permaculture, particularly for right to return as affordable housing policy."
10_30_2019,affordable housing,"Affordable housing and affordable commercial space go hand in hand. Market rate, commercial space is high and the terms often leave the tenant with little to no rights whatsoever. Think of triple net lease terms."
10_30_2019,affordable housing,"Creative space certification. It's important to preserve future use as a resource. Expanding opportunities for rooftop creative spaces, exploring options to incentivize creative space landlords, refine requirements for new live work spaces, establish a creative space definition within the mixed use commercial zone, incorporate creative spaces into the commercial spaces of affordable housing developments, art pod, and investments in retrofits."
10_30_2019,homeless,"DATE0 we have 11 city partnered nonprofits and 10 umbrella organizations and together they represent more than 450 organizations that our employees can donate to through their paychecks. The nice thing about this campaign is they can make a one-time donation or they can spread that donation out over 26 pay periods. The charitable campaign has organizations that span the range of environmental services, help for the homeless, help for veterans, animals."
12_13_2017,homeless; homelessness,"Third, the city and its partners, county and [ORGANIZATION] and others, simply have to do better. No one that I talk to, no one has the least interest in criminalizing homelessness, harassing the homeless, and claiming otherwise really is a distraction from the real issue at hand, which we think is the enabling of a lawless subculture on public property. So the extent there is a tremendous groundswell, obviously, of discontent over the increase in property crime, the health hazards."
12_13_2017,homelessness,"And if you're going to be back [ORGANIZATION] after [ORGANIZATION], let me also tell you what would be helpful for us to hear. because as you know, we are pursuing a comprehensive response around...  homelessness. This administration, along with the county, has never invested more in prevention, rent assistance, emergency shelter, housing strategies, addiction, mental health treatment on that side of the spectrum, nor has there been a more concerted effort in [LOCATION] around what I'm describing as livability issues, enforcing codes, ensuring safety, addressing  uh, uh, public health and public safety concerns, environmental concerns."
12_13_2017,homeless,"So I have goodwill, but there's a lot of serious things going on. My son was killed here by the [ORGANIZATION]. I'm currently homeless."
12_13_2017,homeless,Okay.  spiritual occult behavior and it goes into the homeless scenario as well it I want to mention the Christian institutions like [ORGANIZATION] red ORG1 as well as where I am the [INSTITUTION] light ORG2  run by people hanging skeletons and signs of Satan from their ceiling in their offices? Why is that? And they're supposed to be Christian.
12_13_2017,homelessness,"So what I'd like to say is this homelessness situation. I'd like to be a part of that. As far as [ORGANIZATION] is concerned, again, I'm not saying war against them."
12_13_2017,homeless,"And so what I will say to you [ORGANIZATION] about these two gentlemen that have done such an amazing body of work that has shaped the fabric of our city, whether it is police reform, social justice, housing, feeding the homeless, clothing. Finding people jobs. You know the foundation of the African American church has been the [STREET] where we go, where we have not had, we've had our rights denied."
12_13_2017,affordable housing,"It's more important than ever that [ORGANIZATION] defend and advance its interests. As we've seen from the [PERSON]ional Tax Plan and recent [ORGANIZATION] announcements regarding the prioritization of Superfund sites,  [PERSON] and the current presidential administration are pivotal in our ability to address community priorities like investing in affordable housing and moving forward with the [ORGANIZATION] cleanup. The administration and the leadership in [PERSON] have made it clear."
12_13_2017,affordable housing,"with this tax bill that their priorities are not supporting working middle-class Americans. Additionally, it's clear that local government is going to need to further step up as the federal government retreats from addressing issues like affordable housing and mental health services at the community level. Lastly, as the [ORGANIZATION] has issued a list prioritizing the [ORGANIZATION] site, we'll be working closely with other interested parties to make sure that this process does indeed move forward."
12_13_2017,homeless; affordable housing,"Once again, the top priority is affordable housing, homeless assistance, mental health and support services all kind of packaged in one big omnibus priority. You also have response to the opioid crisis, immigration, investment in urban infrastructure, the Urban Area Security Initiative, which is also known as [ORGANIZATION]. And then tax reform and FAC0 cleanup were two new additions to the priority list from the [ORGANIZATION] agenda because we used that as a baseline."
12_13_2017,affordable housing,"And our focus was primarily on the potential devastating impact on affordable housing development with the loss of private activity bonds and low-income housing tax credits. I don't think I have additional comments on the federal side, so I'll just say aye. I appreciate your ongoing connection of us with our federal delegation when they visit back in [ORGANIZATION] during the sessions and over the course of time too."
10_26_2016,homeless,"Increase ORG0 and [ORGANIZATION] by $150,000 to provide miter repairs to recreational vehicles lived in by the homeless, allowing them to relocate or, at a minimum, make their vehicles safe for habitation.  and to provide resources for dismantling of certain RVs. If approved, those dollars be used to recycle derelict RVs with little or no salvage value that are cost prohibitive for owners to recycle. As a result, these RVs are often sold or auctioned for very minimal amounts and repeatedly cycle through the tow yards and back onto the streets of [ORGANIZATION]."
10_26_2016,homeless,"This position will provide data collection and analysis services for [ORGANIZATION] and was intended to be a limited duration request and update Exhibits 1 through 5 as needed to reflect this change. Yes, sir. Second."
10_26_2016,homelessness,"For those who are really attentive, this discussion comes with a 48-page [ORGANIZATION]. And while we are making strides and we have a joint office with the county working on homelessness, we know that the de facto policy of this city is for 1,000-plus people to lay on our sidewalks and lay under our bridges with almost nothing, sometimes a tarp. They can't get that from any city agency if they don't have a tarp or a blanket."
10_26_2016,homeless; homelessness,"We know that [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] have considered policies based on the [ORGANIZATION] disclosure, and Republican Congressman [PERSON] from [ORGANIZATION] actually authored an amendment designed to prevent ORG1 from subsidizing a GPE3 company that has CEO pay more than 100 times that of its medium worker pay. and [ORGANIZATION] staff from a member of ORG2 which is [ORGANIZATION] called my office to inquire about the surtax proposal before us DATE1 together we can make a difference on this issue before asking mr PERSON1 to come up and explain the mechanics i do have an amendment to propose the ordinance before you has a statement that is somewhat out of date  It says, now, therefore, the council directs item B, the city budget office will increase the ongoing current appropriation level target for ORG3 by $2.5 million starting DATE2, to support the joint office of homeless services efforts to help people move off the [STREET], out of shelters, and back into permanent housing, as well as services that help people avoid homelessness. Thank you."
10_26_2016,homeless,"When I proposed this surtax, there was a $3.5 million gap between the commitment we had made to funding homeless services in [ORGANIZATION] and the amount that we spent in ongoing funds [PERSON] on homeless services. And I proposed that the approximately $2.5 million that we expect this surtax to raise would help to close that gap. In the meantime, in the context of the fall bump, we actually have already raised the [ORGANIZATION] target for [ORGANIZATION] by $3.5 million."
10_26_2016,homeless,"And I know, speaking as the commissioner in charge of [ORGANIZATION], that that bureau could not tolerate a [ADDRESS] about their bureaus. So, although given what we did in the bump on homeless services, the funding funds in this proposal is no longer targeted to a specific service, raising this additional revenue will help us bridge the gap between our revenue and our demands in [ORGANIZATION] so that we will not have to make cuts in critical services."
10_26_2016,homeless,"I would ask you to do one thing, though, and that's to focus this new revenue on those folks who need it most, the jobless, the homeless, those disabled. We stand in support of this measure. Thank you very much."
10_26_2016,affordable housing,"We give tax breaks for creation of affordable housing. There is the home mortgage interest deduction, which Commissioner [PERSON] raises occasionally, which is originally suggested as a [STREET] to promote homeownership. We have a tax deduction for charitable contributions, which is designed to –"
10_26_2016,homelessness,"I do think it looks like a [STREET] to pay for needed services that the city has promised. Originally, you intended it to be paying for the gap in [ORGANIZATION] budget to fund [PERSON], so I applaud that original intent. And now, because we're finding that money [ORGANIZATION] in the budget, I'm sure there will be some other changes  needs of the city that need to be funded."
09_26_2018,homeless,We're drowning in lack of support. Businesses are now getting taxed more on their trash bills to pay for litter cleanup from the homeless camps. Nobody signed up for this.
09_26_2018,homelessness,"And just so you know, this is an issue that I approach with urgency. It's one that I understand is a very complex issue. I have walked around FAC0, and I am familiar with the issues around homelessness, camping, trash, litter, needles, defecation, and graffiti."
09_26_2018,homelessness,"And during that time, I have fought very, very hard to increase public safety, park rangers, police officers. I just announced a trash collection initiative that I will be working with business districts and the neighborhood associations and volunteer organizations like [ORGANIZATION]. on we have significantly increased funding for homelessness prevention, for shelter, for services."
09_26_2018,homeless,"I'll go to an event [TIME], and this will be the issue that's talked about. I'm on a radio show on [ORGANIZATION] where I'm told for [TIME] people are going to yell at me about the homeless crisis. So the question I always have is what should we be doing that we are not doing with the resources, the finite resources we have?"
09_26_2018,homeless,"It was a very controversial decision, as you're well aware, and I agree with you on the staffing. I was just down in [ORGANIZATION] talking to the mayor there, talking about homeless issues, talking about livability issues, which loom large in [ORGANIZATION] as well as here in [PERSON] and up in GPE2 with Mayor [PERSON]. They have...  over twice as many police officers as we have here in the city of [PERSON], but their population is only about a third larger."
09_26_2018,homeless,"PERSON0. Due to untreated mental health issues, [PERSON] was homeless in [ORGANIZATION] off and on [ORGANIZATION]. Since then, he has been both a board member and community organizer at [ORGANIZATION], a board member at [ORGANIZATION], and an advisory council member for the Mental Health Association of [ORGANIZATION]."
09_26_2018,homelessness; housing crisis,"His ongoing interests include public health care, the housing crisis, homelessness, local politics, reading nonfiction books, especially history, and meeting new people. And finally, [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON] is currently an adjunct professor at [ORGANIZATION] and a social worker with [PERSON]."
09_26_2018,housing crisis,"So it's unchartered. It rises from the ashes of a process that failed and left a lot of bad feeling. It addresses one of the two key issues facing our city, which is the housing crisis and public safety."
09_26_2018,homelessness,"And [ORGANIZATION], I came in there and said, my daughter faces homelessness. I can do nothing to help her. And I told the mayor about this."
09_26_2018,homeless,"PERSON0 I wish to announce this, that I consider... The use of FAC0 as a shelter for homeless people as a contribution, a charitable contribution to the city of [ORGANIZATION], the use of resources."
09_26_2018,homeless,"When I was homeless, every feeding center shut down except in [ORGANIZATION]. The [INSTITUTION] near FAC0, which is ran by the synagogue, was the first largest synagogue west of the [ORGANIZATION]. Okay, I've actually been there, and I had an DATE1 Jewish teacher named Mrs. [PERSON] at [ORGANIZATION], and my relatives are all Christian."
09_26_2018,homeless,"So I am now Jewish, whether the Jewish faith accepts it. And I think that's one of the sad things that Commissioner [PERSON], is he has provided the city council for [ORGANIZATION] with,  A Jewish influence. So I'm Jewish, and I will do that because I just heard that, you know, was it [PERSON] or DATE2, FAC0 is a homeless, allows, how much would it cost the city to put 100 people in a [INSTITUTION]?"
09_26_2018,homeless,That is a charitable contribution. How much would it cost for the city of [ORGANIZATION] to have a [ORGANIZATION] party and feed homeless people? That is a charitable contribution with no overhead staff.
09_26_2018,homeless,"I don't think you should sell it. I think you should give it to the library, give it to this new shelter, the [ORGANIZATION] shelter, so that homeless people can have access to the Internet or whatever, if it's capable of doing that. Number two is, I want to tell you, I made a derogatory statement against x-ray therapy in favor of chemotherapy."
09_30_2020,homeless,i i appreciate it and and just a quick footnote here um i have been meeting with different business district associations chambers [ORGANIZATION] i actually visited a number of small business owners and i'm absolutely hearing  the concerns that are being expressed around public safety and around livability. And I am working with the [ORGANIZATION] police borough and social service providers and those who work with homeless populations to find some solutions that will provide some relief in the immediate term.
09_30_2020,affordable housing,"Just to go through a couple of things about [ORGANIZATION]. So again, starting in [ORGANIZATION], any building adding 20 or more units is required to contribute to the city's affordable housing inventory through [ORGANIZATION]. Developers must choose from several options in order to fulfill inclusionary housing requirements, providing affordable units in an otherwise market rate building.  sending units to another building, or paying into the inclusionary housing fund."
09_30_2020,affordable housing,"So I want to commend this developer for building units that are more affordable. And really  challenging the widely held belief that it's too expensive to develop affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]. And yeah, I think I'll leave it at that."
09_30_2020,affordable housing,"And just to kind of add on a couple of comments, you know, this is a, you know, this is a tricky one in front of [ORGANIZATION], so we appreciate the discussion. ORG1 inclusionary housing program doesn't regulate what a developer can build in terms of types of bedrooms or the size of the bedrooms. It simply requires that a portion of those become regulated affordable housing."
09_30_2020,affordable housing,"but if you added to It'd be, you know, 22% where the others are at 18 and 19%. So once again, the larger unit for family friendly affordable housing is the one that gets shortchanged  So just would like us to continue to try to push for larger units for families. And that's a great location for families in terms of access to schools and parks."
09_30_2020,affordable housing,"If our inclusionary housing policy is generating affordable units that are above market rate in  I will support this, but we need to  we need to dig in and figure out how to solve for some of these challenges. The other thing I want to say, it's relevant to the last item, but also to this one, is if we are seeing an overproduction in studios and one bedrooms, and we can't compel developers to offer larger units as their rent-restricted units, then  PERSON0, You know, one of the solutions is we we address our investments accordingly with the with the dollars that we have to build affordable housing and we invest more in those two and three bedroom units. Thank you."
09_30_2020,homeless,"Authorize new construction financing in an amount not to exceed $16,754,923.00.  for [ORGANIZATION] or a [ORGANIZATION] Affiliate. Colleagues, ORG2 is the first [ORGANIZATION] housing bond project that weaves [ORGANIZATION]'s capital funds with much-needed support service dollars from [LOCATION] to provide housing for our most vulnerable residents. We thank the development team of [ORGANIZATION], one of the city's key nonprofits that house many chronic homeless and related [ORGANIZATION] as project manager and bringing forward this project during these uncertain times when permanent supportive housing is needed more than ever before."
09_30_2020,affordable housing,"As you can see on this slide here with the red [STREET], this is where [ORGANIZATION] departments will be located. Next slide, please. It is one of the 12 bond projects that have been identified and it will be the third project to open to welcome new Portlanders to affordable housing."
09_30_2020,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] slide, please. The FAC0 project will be a beautiful new 138 four-story building. Seven of the units will be paired with intensive support services with people who were formerly homeless, for whom wraparound services will be helpful to their long-term success."
09_30_2020,affordable housing,"Each and every [ORGANIZATION] project will contain supportive housing units. And as the mayor indicated, this is through a partnership between ORG1 and ORG2, and we are very grateful to them for providing the funding for the supportive housing. The project will also be part of our city's commitment to providing affordable housing along the FAC0 transit corridor."
09_30_2020,homelessness,"Construction is expected to begin [ORGANIZATION], which is just in a matter of [LOCATION], and be complete in DATE2. Next slide, please. In addition to focused units for those exiting homelessness, the building will also be focused on providing housing for families in [ORGANIZATION]."
09_30_2020,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] slide. [ORGANIZATION] is taking full advantage of the constitutional amendment that state voters passed, allowing us to leverage funds with bond funding for affordable housing. As you can see by this slide, the project will receive just over $16 million in bond funding, but we'll be leveraging an additional $27 million of other funding to make this 138-unit project possible."
09_30_2020,affordable housing,I'm [PERSON] with [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] actually opened their doors [ORGANIZATION] and we have been able to swiftly bring about five affordable housing projects into development for the [ORGANIZATION] metro area. We're really proud about this. This success is largely attributed to the great partnerships with folks like [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] Housing Bureau.
09_30_2020,affordable housing,"issue for families, low-income families and all families, especially now. And this is a first of its kind in this area actually to co-locate FAC0 within affordable housing and we're really excited to shepherd that through. As well, [ORGANIZATION] will be providing  further outreach services for our communities of color and immigrant and refugee families, which are a large population out in the southeast corridor."
09_30_2020,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] And my name is [PERSON] and I'm the Director of Real Estate Development at ORG0. So we are very pleased to partner with [PERSON]  on this important project. As you've heard, it will bring stable, affordable housing for 138 households in outer southeast [ORGANIZATION]."
09_30_2020,affordable housing,"So we look forward to this project's successful construction and eventual opening. And we also welcome this building as our neighbor to [ORGANIZATION] that just broke ground in [ORGANIZATION], and it's just across the [STREET] from this building. So on behalf of [ORGANIZATION], thank you for your support for this project and for all affordable housing to serve [ORGANIZATION]'s residents in need."
09_30_2020,affordable housing,"Thank you, Mayor. And thank you, [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] staff.  for this fabulous partnership. Let me just say, you listened through the last conversation we had about affordable housing and what's affordable and what isn't."
09_30_2020,homeless,"We do not have the city resources to cover this all ourselves, and we can't afford to see tens of thousands of people displaced or a doubling, an estimated doubling of our homeless population if we do nothing. I appreciate the steps we've taken at the city and county level and I'll continue to support and promote needed protections throughout the pandemic. Absolutely has to be a legislative priority for us in [ORGANIZATION] or [LOCATION] too."
09_30_2020,affordable housing,So we can keep [ORGANIZATION] full of those types of housing providers. And they often provide housing for those that really need affordable housing. That's the true affordable housing in our city.
10_19_2016,houseless,"As a case manager, I see the negative impacts that ever-increasing health care costs have on working families. I see it in the fleeting smile of a houseless, single mom doing her best to stay healthy while providing for her kids, affording health care for her family as a luxury far from her reach. I feel the impact on my own family."
10_19_2016,homeless,"Notably, it doesn't extend coverage to immigrants, leaving a large and unconscionable gap in the program. It's made a huge difference to many people, driving down the uninsurance rate in [ORGANIZATION] to just 5%. I recently, Mayor [PERSON] and I went to [PERSON] to view a homeless services campus they have there."
10_19_2016,homeless,"I get school coats for children. I get blankets for homeless people. In here, I've never been nothing but a gadfly."
10_19_2016,homeless,"We're launching a project with [ORGANIZATION] to give advocates the flexibility they need to get in the community and work with people who, for a variety of reasons, are not in a position to seek assistance or identify sexual assault when they're going to different agencies. Advocates will go to schools, urgent care, churches, [ORGANIZATION], and homeless shelters to identify people in crisis. We will work with providers who are already seeing survivors in order to increase capacity throughout the county.  and will learn how to remove barriers to service and remove the conditions in our community that cause sexual assault."
10_19_2016,homeless,"So just as a brief reminder, [ORGANIZATION] you heard a presentation from [ORGANIZATION], the Director of [ORGANIZATION], and also from several community members about this engagement plan. This report is coming back to ORG1 as required in the budget note. Okay."
10_19_2016,homelessness,"I probably won't be able to join you for whatever you're able to piece together [TIME] after we see how things are hopefully getting better in [ORGANIZATION] near the gas explosion. But at [TIME], we may be able to touch base with [ORGANIZATION], who I hope that this open comment realizes that homelessness is such a crisis that it was unfortunate that the [STREET] he was scheduled and Mr. [PERSON] not being able to comment was –  a point of contention for a lot of people. I also, in light of what's just occurred between [ORGANIZATION] and Mr. [PERSON], want to say that it's still unclear, I think, in the eyes of many people, including attorneys at [ORGANIZATION], if what you did [ORGANIZATION] actually is within the confines of the law."
10_19_2016,homeless,"I believe it was [ORGANIZATION], Mayor, you wanted to give the police a raise, and you wanted to raise taxes to do it, and when the taxes, when they decided not to do that, you go, well,  You can't give the police a raise and you're saying that these homeless programs are in jeopardy and stuff like that. Now you just gave the police a big, huge raise on their contracts. My concern is where's all this money coming from?"
10_19_2016,homeless,"This photo is a photo of a solar pilot project, basically, in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], to help  homeless populations with their electricity needs when they don't have a traditional [STREET] to plug in a laptop or a phone or something like that. That's something that [ORGANIZATION] is really interested in exploring. That's one of the  Actually, a few of the actions in the mitigation action plan talk about solar plus battery storage projects, pilot projects in various locations, community centers and in low-income neighborhoods that could really benefit from this technology."
10_24_2018,homeless,"Just say what you have to say. Well, I think that if we're talking about managing the volume and dealing with having the capacity to deal with biosolids, he spoke about...  the ability of digesters to manage biosolids, and I think that these digesters do a good job. And if we have 20,000 homeless people and we house them in tiny houses with...  compostable toilets, very nice expensive compostable toilets that do an excellent job with the bioprocessing of digesting waste, we're helping to reduce the waste of the city and helping to manage the ability and the capacity of the city to deal with their waste."
10_24_2018,homeless,It has reduced capacity. And so this would be an excellent [STREET] to get the homeless into a more healthy environment and deal with the capacity issues that the city has in dealing with its solid waste. Okay.
10_24_2018,homelessness,"please oh i'm sorry PERSON0 um so i would like to talk about this conflict of interest thing as it relates to uh the county PERSON1 works for PERSON2 who's the uh you know [PERSON] and he's the housing policy advisor well  He's an American citizen who is originally from [ORGANIZATION], and when he offered to help me find housing because I was criticizing [PERSON], I asked him to publicly state that he is not connected to [PERSON], and he talked circles around me, and then he disappeared for [ORGANIZATION], and he stopped talking to me. And it seems to me that when you've got [PERSON] who puts people  People who are in wheelchairs outside because they have overstayed their number of emergency nights."
10_24_2018,homelessness,"That's why they're building this new shelter for housing alternatives. But back to [ORGANIZATION], back to this idea that you should not be connected to a contractor who's got horrible human rights abuses in these shelters and then you're advising them  [ORGANIZATION], the head of ORG1 on housing policy. That is not good."
10_24_2018,homeless,"I'm here to speak a little bit for myself, though you'll probably see me more than once and hear my story [ORGANIZATION]. I am fairly well educated, articulate. I'm the widow of a college professor, and yet my family is terrified that I will be homeless."
10_24_2018,homeless,"They've brought me here on an emergency basis. I live in a housing insecure situation with a family member who may at some point go into nursing home or die. And when that happens, I will be homeless."
10_24_2018,homeless,"This is adopted. [DATE]. Amend contract with [ORGANIZATION] to increase the not-to-exceed amount by $375,742 to provide additional treatment readiness services, transitional housing, and follow-up retention support services to chemically dependent homeless adult chronic arrestees."
10_24_2018,homeless,"And I'm all for that. I tried to come and put my money down for [ORGANIZATION] on all these 30 properties with [ORGANIZATION] for the public benefit of housing homeless people. So I had to go across to county and do it at county, and I've got these public records now."
10_24_2018,homeless,"And I would like to have my offer accepted by you guys, and I would like to put homeless people on this offer. on all the properties, actually, but particularly on the three-acre property that is between FAC0 and FAC1 on the east side of the river. That is, there's a bike path, and it's 6631 FAC2."
10_17_2018,homeless,"And it's not like all homeless people have no income. Most of us out there do have an income or have degrees in this or have abilities to do this or that or the other. The thing is that it's about money, and I understand that."
10_17_2018,homeless,"It's located a block south of the newly constructed 80-unit FAC0. All of these units are subject to the city's preference policy. Six of the units will serve households at or below 30% [ORGANIZATION], in other words, very low income, with three serving permanent supporting housing residents and the other three serving homeless families."
10_17_2018,homeless,"And the other units will actually be, the 30% units will be focused on families coming out of the homeless family system of care. So with that, I'd like to turn it over to [ORGANIZATION] to give you a few brief words on the project. Well, I was actually going to talk more about innovative housing because you guys have all the details about the project I'm happy to answer questions."
10_17_2018,affordable housing,"In addition, we will, of course, bring our full range of family services to help residents succeed and make the most of their housing. We really appreciate the city's support and partnership in our efforts to bring more affordable housing to [ORGANIZATION]. I'm happy to answer questions about the project if you have any or also defer them to our technical experts if they're over my head."
10_17_2018,affordable housing,"with all of the projects that we had in the north and northeast strategy area. So we'll be bringing all of those projects to fruition, as we promised to the community, despite the fact that we've been facing tax credit pricing issues as well as rising costs in construction, which is really what has caused the gaps for our projects. But in combination with the great work of our affordable housing providers and  The collaboration with the state and the available funds they've had, we're able to make our commitments to the community and to the preference policy families that we'll be bringing into those units."
10_17_2018,homeless,"I would like to talk about ORG0ORG1 and the housing projects that you're putting up, they're not the numbers of 30% and homeless people that you're planning to house in these housing projects alone. are a drop in the bucket. And you're cherry picking, you're taking people who have the most social security income and are the least disabled, and you're putting them in this housing."
10_17_2018,homelessness,"And I hope that [ORGANIZATION] will be working closely with their tenants to talk about that. you know, what happens when they break through that 60% MFI and that there'll be resources in [STREET] to help those people adapt to the insanity of market rate housing in [ORGANIZATION]. But, you know, when we talk about dealing with people in poverty and dealing with homelessness, we have a whole spectrum of symptom severity."
10_17_2018,homelessness,"The [ORGANIZATION] plan for homelessness died, and it's very rare for us to see in this chamber's actual graphs about how the population for [ORGANIZATION] is trending up and where the stagnation or even the drops in low-income housing were and how we're going to recover from that. Thank you very much. Thank you."
10_17_2018,affordable housing,"And I remind everybody there are two ballot measures. Those who are registered to vote will be able to act on on [ORGANIZATION]. One would provide affordable housing for the metro area, and the other would make government dollars go further."
10_17_2018,affordable housing,"Thank you. And I want to join in what Commissioner [PERSON] said, that for people that think we're not doing enough to boost the supply of affordable housing, Measures 102 and 26-199 squarely address that issue. And if that is very important to you, take a good look at it."
10_17_2018,affordable housing,"Number one, it provides a transition from either the streets or shelter into housing, and that's been a withering need in this community. Number two, it provides affordable housing to people in our community who are currently being priced out.  of our community, and number three, this provides the kind of wraparound services, including close proximity and pathways to job training and economic prosperity that people would naturally need. So I think this is a very, very well thought out and worthy project, and I'm very happy to be supporting it."
10_17_2018,affordable housing,Would you turn that off just for a moment because I'm struggling to find it on the...  hello mayor and commissioners my name is [ORGANIZATION] i'm special projects director for saint [PERSON] of what i've been tasked with for [ORGANIZATION] is the renovation of extremely distressed mobile home parks primarily in [ORGANIZATION] when we were asked to come up here to [PERSON] to take a look at this particular park we welcome the opportunity to share our knowledge and information about this naturally affordable um  reoccurring affordable housing stock. We now have eight parks in which we have done complete renovations for.
10_17_2018,homeless,"That said, at the time, this council was faced with a lot of different members of this mobile home park who do have loans on these homes. So when a park closes, they're essentially left. homeless and even more in debt with their initial coach."
10_17_2018,housing crisis,"It's important to keep in mind we're housing 60 low-income individuals, and this was an anti-displacement effort. And I hope we will get it more right in the future. We've done a really poor job preventing or mitigating displacement during this lengthy and ongoing housing crisis, and this was a well-intentioned effort."
10_17_2018,housing crisis,"This is also the worst kind of profiteering during a housing crisis. It's reprehensible to me that this landlord was not only allowed to raise rents when they were providing dangerous and substandard conditions, but was allowed to charge rents at all. And it just underscores how vital it is that we get our rental registration system up and running, and we start the mandatory rental inspections through [ORGANIZATION], which is one of the efforts that I hoped to begin during my tenure as the commissioner in charge of [ORGANIZATION]."
10_17_2018,affordable housing,and I think what's been documented at the very least is a painful learning curve. We made a commitment. We're trying to use this as a sort of a living laboratory to understand better how we might save this critically important piece of the affordable housing spectrum.
10_17_2018,affordable housing,"Could you read item [DATE], please? Yes. [DATE], amend [ORGANIZATION] renter's protections code to clarify the exemption for affordable housing providers."
10_17_2018,homeless,"Thank you. amend a contract with [ORGANIZATION] to increase the not-to-exceed amount by $375,742 to provide additional treatment readiness services, transitional housing, and follow-up retention support services to chemically dependent homeless adult chronic arrestees. Thank you for being here."
10_17_2018,homeless,"The program is currently a six-bed program, which allows [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], that's the officer-clinician teams, to address those issues.  who they're working with that have perceived mental illness and also homeless to address the housing first. So it's a direct resource for the behavioral health response teams.  to refer to the program, and then ORG2 provides all the wraparound services for next steps, stabilization, connecting to treatment services, and then next steps to appropriate either transitional housing, permanent housing, and again wraparound services. It also includes..."
10_17_2018,homeless,"I'm  within the homeless community. The service coordination team's work is to reach those people who are most getting arrested. So as police commissioner, you're going to help yourself, Mayor, by approving this budget and getting those statistics down."
10_17_2018,homeless,"What frustrates me is we are constantly here at [ORGANIZATION] debating the service coordination team's budget when I personally feel it is the best program the police bureau has to minimize the criminalization of the police. Of the homeless. So I'm appealing to you, actually, Mayor, in your position as police commissioner."
10_17_2018,homeless,"I'd appreciate it. But again, sorry for the subtraction. This is an amazing but horribly underfunded program that will do great work toward the  the goal of decriminalization of the homeless and it will get a lot of people off your back there so i'm appealing a little personal here too thank you thank you"
10_17_2018,homeless,"It moves to second reading. But in response to some of the testimony, I just want to read –  uh... one set of facts as you know [ORGANIZATION] provides the services that support the service coordination teams effort to decrease chronic arrests of homeless adults who are enrolled in the bureau's housing rapid response program the program is proven  there was an based on data from [ORGANIZATION] there was an 82 percent reduction in post program arrests for those who had graduated from the program that is the point of this program is to reduce interactions between the chronically homeless and the police and to do that by providing whatever services people need to get off and stay off the streets including  drug addiction treatment. Is it too small?"
10_17_2018,affordable housing,"And [DATE], approve application under [ORGANIZATION] under [ORGANIZATION]  located at [ADDRESS]. Colleagues, these projects will join 37 other private sector projects in the inclusionary housing permit approval pipeline, totaling a minimum of 342 affordable housing units and otherwise market rate developments. Together, these apartment buildings will provide 208 units of new housing combined, 60 of which will be affordable for [ORGANIZATION] to households earning up to 80% of median family income as part of the inclusionary housing program."
10_17_2018,affordable housing,"Each ORG1-application, as you know, comes before [ORGANIZATION] for approval. In addition to the [ORGANIZATION] tax exemption provided by the ORG1, these projects will receive an exemption of the affordable housing construction excise tax and system development charges that otherwise would have been due on the affordable units. Director [PERSON], welcome back."
10_17_2018,affordable housing,"One is the next hotel, FAC0, the studio and guild theater building window replacement and renovation work next to FAC1 and the vibrant [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION]. And then there have been a few approvals that have been appealed by the neighborhood, the FAC2 building,  [PERSON], [PERSON] in [LOCATION], and FAC5 in LOC2. The one denial from [ORGANIZATION]'s perspective was a case of not all parties bringing the attitude of collaboration that [ORGANIZATION] noted to the process forward."
10_17_2018,housing crisis,"And then the second is that DOSA improvements include greater public outreach, and so there is more public participation in our process, and it's not unreasonable to assume that moving forward there may be more appeals because there is more public participation in the process. Thank you. So given how much time we all spend thinking about [ORGANIZATION]'s housing crisis, we decided to take a look at how housing has been playing out in the hearings room over the course of [ORGANIZATION]."
10_17_2018,affordable housing,"Not all of these will move forward, but for all intents and purposes, there are about 4,800 housing units in the Type 3 pipeline alone. So this is our last slide before we move to the overview of projects, and it's a look at housing proposals that have moved through the design review process since [ORGANIZATION], projects that aren't vested and have an obligation to provide affordable housing units. The Type 2 bar on the left is a standalone, but [ORGANIZATION], and Type 3 bars are cumulative."
10_17_2018,affordable housing,"Their offer was, in order to increase the development capacity for FAC0, was to put affordable housing units in this new housing building on the [ORGANIZATION] blocks. It is our belief that this really does a great job with [PERSON], contribute to a vibrant streetscape, and B5, make plazas, parks, and open spaces successful. FAC1, built in [ORGANIZATION]."
10_17_2018,affordable housing,So it also does a really great job of addressing the [LOCATION] blocks. [DATE] [ORGANIZATION]. This is 240 units of affordable housing that I'm very close to.
10_17_2018,affordable housing,"When it came to [ORGANIZATION], it was subject to the guidelines of [ORGANIZATION], which was affordable housing. So this is a conspicuous win for the community because this could have been just high-end condos, and that's what [PERSON] was working with the developer on. And when the transition occurred, we got a chance to pick up affordable housing in a very high-opportunity area in a very desirable location."
10_17_2018,affordable housing,"We have navigated these processes with a diverse range of project types, from thousands of units of market-rate housing to hundreds of units of affordable housing to community health and cultural centers to tiny commercial storefronts. With this experience, there are two observations we wanted to share with you for future planning. One, discretionary, guideline-based processes are vital to fostering design excellence."
10_17_2018,affordable housing,"And I wonder how many cities at the foot of what is such a marquee entrance, I mean, it is the foot of FAC0, it's our cultural district, has as two knockout buildings one. One building that's for deeply affordable housing for low-income people, and the second a health department building, which together seem to speak to each other in an interesting [STREET]. I wonder what your thoughts are."
10_17_2018,affordable housing,"Thank you. Oh, footnote. [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and [ORGANIZATION] have been selected to design the new affordable housing building that will be going up at Southeast FAC0 and FAC1."
10_17_2018,affordable housing,"And I think we're doing great, but we still need to look for ways to improve the process, and especially for vital projects such as affordable housing. I vote aye. Thank you very much for an excellent presentation."
10_17_2018,housing crisis,"So first of all, thank you for an outstanding presentation to you, to the commission members, and to the staff. Thank you for focusing us on the long-term health and success of our city. When you have a housing crisis, when you have growing pains that we're going through, when you have a fractured narrative about what the future of [ORGANIZATION] is,  It's very easy for people to become critics, and we have our critics about the whole design review process, about the commitment to quality, opportunity, sustainability."
10_17_2018,affordable housing,"So I think that's a fight we have to take on anew. I think design guidelines have been thrown into this narrative that a handful of people have pitched, along with undue delays in the permitting process and a few other things, that essentially urges us to throw the baby out with the bathwater, that in this time where we need lots of development, we've got to streamline the process and potentially compromise on our values. We see it clearly in the affordable housing side."
10_17_2018,affordable housing,"There is a wholesale line of attack on the idea of building affordable housing for the long term. It has quality where people are paid a living wage that's sustainable and that is built in high opportunity areas. And conversely, there's a narrative about moving the housing to the corners of our neighborhood, of our city, where the dirt is the cheapest, building for the short term and worrying about rebuilding later on."
12_14_2017,homelessness,"Just wanted to clarify. And then this last slide may actually be my favourite because really, Mayor [PERSON], it addresses something that you just wrote about, the problem of homelessness. Yes."
12_14_2017,homeless,"homeless youth or kids who are likely to be homeless and introduce soccer to them. We're doing this in [ORGANIZATION] and other places. And this is really to get them into a sport where they feel valued, they develop friendships, and they feel more part of the community."
12_14_2017,homeless,"Number one, you are opportunistic and you see sports as a [STREET]  as an opportunity for economic prosperity for the community. I appreciate that you're always looking at opportunities for access as well. And I think the program that you mentioned that tries to engage people  homeless or potentially homeless youth in sports as an opportunity to bring them in and help them feel appreciated and loved and part of a bigger community, I think speaks volumes not only about the mission of [ORGANIZATION], but about you and your leadership personally."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], my co-chair, and [PERSON], [LOCATION], our veterans representative, and I represent a broad-based group of citizens that include architects, veterans, design community members, preservationists, and other community members. Some of you know me as an architect for affordable housing and involved in schools. So why do I care about FAC0?"
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"We need to focus on building density in close-in districts that are well served by mass transit. The area from FAC0 to the FAC1 site, including FAC2, is one of the best districts for future density. The [PERSON] can be the leverage point, the centerpiece of a transformed FAC2 district, a vibrant and high-density neighborhood that includes offices, retail, hotels, and affordable housing."
10_28_2015,homeless,"This terrified our neighborhood. DATE0, my wife was assaulted by a homeless man a block from our home. She's now constantly afraid and on guard."
10_28_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing; panhandler,"[ORGANIZATION], a visiting friend was spit on and threatened by a panhandler who was displeased with not receiving change. My wife and I, our neighbors and our friends, have had innumerable other experiences with aggressive and criminal behavior from [ORGANIZATION]'s increasing unsheltered populations, and we've all reached our limit. As quoted recently in [ORGANIZATION], the next [ORGANIZATION] article about [ORGANIZATION] isn't going to be about how great our food and wine are.  for [ORGANIZATION] i've watched with great frustration as our city has been allowed to become a destination for lifestyle vagrancy unchecked drug activity limitless [STREET] camping aggressive panhandling and other illegal and disruptive behavior that directly affects the safety and quality of life of residents downtown and citywide sadly [PERSON] is no longer a [STREET] where we can use public spaces without disruption anxiety or fear  Recent efforts to temporarily displace this activity or label it as a byproduct of an affordable housing crisis are short-sighted, misleading, and will not resolve the serious public safety issues we face as a city."
10_28_2015,homeless; affordable housing,"Only after we restore basic rule of law can we then speak about affordable housing and other solutions not related to immediate public safety issues. DATE0, [STREET] kids, drug users, and other lifestyle vagrants flock here in greater numbers to take advantage of the city's hands-off ideology. They inundate our woefully understaffed police force with increasingly brazen and illicit behavior, draw drug and gang activity into the region, and extract dollars, services, and compassion from resident populations of the homeless and mentally ill who really need it."
10_28_2015,homelessness,"It's about behavior, not homelessness. Of course, there are people here in [ORGANIZATION] who desperately need social services and deserve compassion. But compassion that is misdirected helps no one.  to care for those who are legitimately in need we must sort out those who abuse our collective kindness i speak [ORGANIZATION] on behalf of a growing number of portlanders who are very frustrated with the state of our city we implore you to consider the following four solutions one properly staff our police force at [ORGANIZATION] recommended levels and pace staffing with population growth two drastically increase funding exposure for the smart change not spare change campaign to educate portlanders about the dangers of supporting panhandling  Three, commission a neutral third-party study of the true demographics of [ORGANIZATION]'s unsheltered populations."
10_28_2015,homeless,"Then DATE0, please. Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding homeless people's rights and de-partitioned housing. [TIME]."
10_28_2015,homeless,"Morning. I'll begin sharing a story as it helps demonstrate my point [ORGANIZATION]. I came to [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION] to take a DATE2 class that helped me get into [ORGANIZATION] As you recall, I'm sure, back then [ORGANIZATION] was unique in the sense that homeless people had the right to congregate in packs of 100 or more on the streets of downtown."
10_28_2015,homeless,"And that's why people do it, safety in numbers. And secondly, it gives a sense of community and this  This can make all the difference between a livable situation and a very bad one. Lastly, it will reduce the shame of being homeless."
10_28_2015,homelessness,"Now, the ability to make connections and the right to congregate is easily the most overlooked aspect of homelessness. Typically, we think of keeping people fed and warm, but it's been my experience that people will find a [STREET] to keep warm or to feed themselves. But what they can't do by themselves is find connection, find that safety in numbers, that ability to congregate, create community, etc."
10_28_2015,homeless,"Now, underneath that bridge, there was a small group of [STREET] punks off to the side. They had their petty little skirmishes [ORGANIZATION], but they were easily outnumbered by what was a much larger body of peaceful homeless people. And to my eyes, there was a sense of peace, if not community, on the streets of [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]."
10_28_2015,homeless,"And this is a recurrent. Volunteers, they'd come down, and you couldn't tell if they were – I couldn't tell if they were coming down to mark down [TIME] or to just hang out for the fun of it. And this is a recurrent theme you'll find if you go from town to town in homeless situations."
10_28_2015,homelessness,"But yet when we speak of homelessness, the only solution we can think of is to break people up rather than drown it with human nature. But I understand that a select few business leaders' lack of trust for human nature and their interests may take precedent over the very lives of people sleeping on a dirty, pissed-on sidewalk. But if we're going to enact policies that are going to affect people in ways that you can't even begin to understand without getting to know them, we should at least have alternatives in [STREET]."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"Almost done. On that note, and alternatives are not missions that institutionalize and disrespect people. We need, on that note, hopefully [ORGANIZATION] I'll be able to testify and share an idea on affordable housing that could kill two or three birds with one stone and maybe make everybody happy."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"So it is that balance. But, again, I don't want to leave the impression that because our members of the police force don't live in the city of [ORGANIZATION], they're not committed to serve the citizens of [ORGANIZATION]. No, and I think—  One of the things I like about a premium is the data that [ORGANIZATION]'s bureau has been sharing with us recently makes very clear that a police officer is going to have a harder and harder time finding affordable housing in our community."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"I think we can get some clarification on those points. I just wanted to clarify for you that Mr. [PERSON] is not working on any city housing invested projects. He is a developer, and he does develop affordable housing, but there's no current city investments in any of his projects."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"We've been working with [ORGANIZATION] with a group of business owners, property owners, and affordable housing developers in the sort of southeast FAC0 area, and it falls within the area of your pilot project where you've proposed to waive sections of Title 33. And [ORGANIZATION] owns a parking lot there, and they are actually very interested in being part of this pilot. And we previewed this with the group recently that you were working on this, so thank you for your leadership."
10_28_2015,homeless,"Amend contract with [ORGANIZATION] to add $50,000 to house chronically homeless women for a total not to exceed $160,000. PERSON0? Aye. Fish?"
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"Yes. Okay. So if you'd read [DATE] and [DATE], please.  [DATE], direct [ORGANIZATION] to contract for an independent study on the nexus associated with the demand for housing affordable to low and moderate income households created as a result of jobs created by commercial development and an assessment of the extent to which new market rate housing generates additional demand for affordable housing and the economic feasibility of an affordable housing linkage fee."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"[DATE].  [DATE], amend the tax increment financing set aside for affordable housing policy to ensure continued development, preservation, and rehabilitation of housing affordable to households with incomes below 100% medium family income. Thank you. Well, let me begin with a few remarks, and then I'll turn it over to Commissioner [PERSON] and their other council members."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"Thank you, Mayor. DATE0 truly is [LOCATION] for affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]. DATE0 we will take the first steps in creating a new citywide revenue source for the development of new affordable housing, a developer impacts fee."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"And [ORGANIZATION] we will take our urban renewal involvement in affordable housing to new heights.  increasing the set-aside for affordable housing in our urban renewal districts from 30% to 45%. It is painfully obvious that [ORGANIZATION] is experiencing unprecedented growth, and with this growth comes many challenges that all of [ORGANIZATION] is now wrestling with. We must ensure that our communities, especially communities of color, do not face continued displacement."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"We must ensure that our seniors are able to remain in [ORGANIZATION],  close to amenities like transit and social services, as well as their families, we must ensure adequate affordable housing for our most vulnerable populations. We are tackling these challenges in numerous ways, but the biggest part of the solution is funding, specifically targeted towards affordable housing development. The decisions we make [ORGANIZATION] will help ensure that these new funding streams will add and continually add thousands of new affordable units to the city."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"And as everyone in this room knows, [ORGANIZATION] spent a life  fighting for affordable housing in our community, and you could say that she actually built the foundation of this movement. And on [ORGANIZATION], she came before us when we were debating whether to increase funding for affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION], and she sat where Director [PERSON] is sitting, and she said two very powerful things. She said, it is important for you as a council to keep your promises, and I challenge you to do more."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"And as a result of her advocacy and the advocacy of a whole host of groups, including [ORGANIZATION] and affordable housing advocates in [ORGANIZATION] on and a whole chorus of voices, the council made a change in policy and significantly increased funding for affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]. And I felt at the time that that was a turning point for this council. because a lot of familiar faces came back into this building sensing that things were happening in our community, and they demanded that the council take action."
10_28_2015,homelessness; affordable housing,"I'm very proud to be on a council that has said that affordable housing and homelessness is the top concern facing our city. And as [ORGANIZATION] said, we're not done. And under the leadership of this mayor and this housing commissioner, we've taken some big steps, but we are not done."
10_28_2015,homelessness; affordable housing,"And finally, I just want to say that this $67 million is going to be helpful, but as the mayor said...  it's not going to solve the problem [TIME]. And one of the things that I want to work with my colleagues to ensure that as we identify new resources to fight for affordable housing and homelessness, that we target those resources to people with the greatest need. If there ever was a time when we had to target our dollars to people with the greatest need, it is now."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"I would warrant to say that the [ORGANIZATION] will care a great deal about it as well, since they have to market the city as an economic prospect as well. So if there's no further questions on FAC0, I'd like to invite up [ORGANIZATION] Executive Director [PERSON] to join [PERSON] and review the plan for the 45% affordable housing. Slide up another chair there, you guys."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] is honored to have worked with the mayor, Commissioner [PERSON], and [ORGANIZATION] to develop this proposal and make such a significant contribution to address the most pressing problem in [ORGANIZATION], the lack of affordable housing for our residents. As a result of this action, 40% of all urban renewal dollars will have been invested in affordable housing over the [ORGANIZATION] life of the set-aside. And I just want to emphasize that's over the life so that we don't get confused by percentages."
10_28_2015,housing crisis,"Thank you. While some may believe that this proposal took too long to come to council for a vote, the [ORGANIZATION] board and our stakeholders asked for thoughtful consideration of both the tradeoffs and priorities and the impact on [ORGANIZATION]'s long-term sustainability. In the end, we believe this proposal represents a careful balancing of the need for immediate action on our housing crisis and maintaining our commitment to the priorities established with the stakeholders and [ORGANIZATION]s in urban renewal areas."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"We hope the energy and advocacy for more funding for affordable housing continues after the council action, as we all work toward a permanent long-term source for funding for affordable housing. Even with fewer dollars, [ORGANIZATION] remains committed to the strategic plan adopted by this council DATE0 and hopes to engage council in exploring opportunities to solidify [ORGANIZATION]'s financial future. Now I'd like to turn the presentation over to [ORGANIZATION] and PERSON1."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] is status quo at $9.8 million. FAC0 goes from $60 million to $65 million in the aggregate, and [PERSON] goes from $26.5 million  with an increase of $20 million, as I mentioned, with an intertie to the [ORGANIZATION] property, to $46.5 million. So that $66.5 million represents, in total, about a $270 million investment in affordable housing."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"And so it will require us as we come across those opportunities to figure out other funding sources to bring to bear on those projects. But generally speaking, as we go through the other urban renewal areas, again,  these funds were the least programmed. In [ORGANIZATION], we have worked hard to figure out how do we make good on the [ORGANIZATION] action plan and bring forward additional resources to affordable housing."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,This adds $5 million more to the affordable housing pot that was established at that time. And what it's really taking from is the additional resources that we projected could be created from the full build out of the FAC0 property project.  which was in the neighborhood of $25 to $30 million. And there was a range of infrastructure and parks projects that are kind of in that speculative part of our forecast.
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"We discussed increasing the [ORGANIZATION], and we discussed linkage and or inclusionary housing. I understand inclusionary housing is a difficult issue in this state and would require legislative action, so I think you're taking the correct course. by studying linkage, if you will, or charging a per square foot for various developments to generate affordable housing funds."
10_28_2015,homelessness; affordable housing,"As we move through the implementation process, [ORGANIZATION] looks forward to further engagement with officials, community partners, and developers for better effectiveness, transparency, reporting, and accountability. From the local level to the state level, we are excited to forge partnerships to creatively engage and overcome this crisis and secure a safe, healthy, and just community where everyone has a chance to create a life without constant fear of eviction, calamity, and homelessness. From our first proposal,  the [ORGANIZATION]'s DATE0 meeting through our press conference assembly before your [LOCATION] work session we have insisted that crisis requires swift and significant action although the [ORGANIZATION] increase is a small advance in this crisis taking this first step now is critical for [ORGANIZATION]'s and will be life-changing for the hundreds of vulnerable residents who will find the refuge and springboard that affordable housing provides  We understand that reassignment of funds to affordable housing and urban renewal areas may come at a cost to other budgets, but trade-offs are expected in a meaningful response to emergency and there are other costs we want you to bear in mind  the cost of upheaval and even homelessness on the lives of struggling and vulnerable adults and children who find themselves unexpectedly displaced or dispossessed, such as [ORGANIZATION], a resident of the interstate FAC0, who will share her story [DATE], the long-term public cost to parks, transportation, and public safety."
10_28_2015,housing crisis,"These important programs may experience short-term cuts or delays with respect to funding the housing emergency,  but those will be known costs that can be planned for. The longer we take, though, to meaningfully address the burgeoning housing crisis, the greater the unintended costs to local governments for parks, transportation, and safety, spiraling costs in both budget impacts and lost ground on critical goals. Add to those the public costs of damage control from the well-known difficulties with health, education, and chronic poverty suffered by families without stable housing, and we cannot afford not to pass and exceed this new floor."
10_28_2015,housing crisis,"First of all, I just wanted to express appreciation, appreciation for the responsiveness of this leadership to the housing crisis and that some creative process was put in [STREET] to rapidly and tangibly do something of significance to address it. The [ORGANIZATION] set aside being increased to 45% is tremendous in that it is a 50% increase above the present amount. Of course, I think all of us had hoped it would be a 50% increase, but we're glad for a 45%."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"As the chair of [ORGANIZATION], the foresight and intent to develop [ORGANIZATION] with the purpose of keeping accountability and transparency for the city's efforts around affordable housing is proving to be of great value. our primary focus and concern is to ensure that what has been undertaken is under is accomplished with efficiency effectiveness equity and as promised the promises made become the promises kept to that extent um [ORGANIZATION] created a structure to ensure that the funds utilized in the manner the community states uh  that their needs are, that they're met. I would like to ask the council to consider increasing the scope of the oversight committee with additions to membership representing the [ORGANIZATION] area to be included around these additional funds."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"Good [TIME]. You know, as I was looking at the opportunity to testify to you [ORGANIZATION], I reflected back in my life and my career, and I've now worked [LOCATION] in affordable housing and community development in [ORGANIZATION]. And it is clear to me that we are in an unprecedented time."
10_28_2015,homelessness; affordable housing,"We have been challenged with homelessness and affordable housing off and on over [ORGANIZATION] to greater or lesser degrees, but what we're seeing in [LOCATION] or two is really quite stunning. So I also want to applaud the council for the leadership that it is taking to look at this problem in a very comprehensive [STREET] and to look in all corners for the resources that can help contribute to solutions. If we don't solve this, we do risk the health of the overall community."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"We hope that [ORGANIZATION] will support that work. And I know you're looking at other resource-based strategies to support affordable housing. We are at a time where we need those, all the tools, all hands on deck and everyone doing their part."
10_28_2015,housing crisis,"[ORGANIZATION], you said that everybody has a role to play, and you said specifically we're going to talk to the private sector to see what role they'll play. And I just want to underscore, in [ORGANIZATION], 11,000 new market rate apartments, less than 2% of which were affordable. And when I hear developers say that the city has not been generous enough with their subsidies, I say to them, what is your moral obligation to address this housing crisis?"
10_28_2015,housing crisis,"But we're talking about a moral obligation. And to the comment about the impact on families through this housing crisis, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], with a new dynamic principal doing her level best, 50% of the students that she starts [ORGANIZATION] with will not be there on DATE1 of school. And so you want to ask the question, what does it mean not to have stable home for struggling families?"
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"Yes, please, Commissioner [PERSON]. Sorry, I forgot that. Colleagues, this doesn't directly relate to the [ORGANIZATION] set-aside percentage technically, but I think as long as we are talking about committing additional [ORGANIZATION] resources to affordable housing, we should take a look at FAC0."
10_28_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"If it doesn't, we should start actively exploring other alternatives. And finally, we are here [ORGANIZATION] because we know that there is a housing crisis that  And unfortunately, we don't have the tools to address it all at once. But I think that we should be exploring every option to provide for more affordable housing, not just for the poorest people, for middle-income people who are also being squeezed out."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"spokespeople are great so let's call them please the first three or four please come on up are PERSON0 [PERSON] and PERSON3 and they'll be followed by PERSON4 PERSON5 PERSON6 and PERSON7 PERSON8 i think you're on first thank you  Mayor [PERSON] and members of the council, thank you for the chance to talk to you [TIME] in support of raising the [ORGANIZATION] set aside for affordable housing. My name is PERSON10."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"And I hope that that's corrected going forward. On the occasions when the [ORGANIZATION] solicits public input, they consult with only a fairly narrow group of people. The project selection committees are filled with homeowners, property owners, known opponents of affordable housing."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"Renters, housing advocates, and communities of color are rarely at the table for these conversations. So I'll finish there, but I just want to mention that low-income Portlanders –  I've heard the word burden used as far as neighborhoods being burdened with affordable housing, etc. And I just want to push back about that."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"It reads, encourage a range of housing options and supportive environments to enable older adults to remain in their communities as their needs change. To many older adults, retirees, and senior citizens, aging in [STREET] means continuing to live in their owner-occupied single-family homes. While the city offers tax breaks to developers for including affordable housing and multi-unit developments, older adults now retired and living on fixed or semi-fixed incomes who have a lifetime investment in their homes are being taxed out."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"Seniors on fixed incomes who will see their cost of living rise with no corresponding increase in income have been completely left out of the conversation. Where is the dialogue and the mitigation for the financial impacts on these retirees?  It seems only equitable that if 45% or 50% of urban renewal funding is to be dedicated to affordable housing, seniors on fixed or semi-fixed incomes living in their own homes should have a similar percentage reduction from the urban renewal line on their property tax bills. It is simply unjust to expect low-income seniors to subsidize affordable housing for other people."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,I am not in favor of increasing the set-aside in the [ORGANIZATION] area. It is a very small area. It has more than its share of affordable housing.
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"Hi. My name is [ORGANIZATION]. You may remember me from such hearings as raising the minimum wage for city workers alongside 15 Now, the Climate Action Plan, speaking as a local scientist, and now [ORGANIZATION] on affordable housing."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"we're looking at [ADDRESS] within these halls counselors i ask for a volunteer and this is the offer i've secured an affordable housing unit to occupy for a term of [ORGANIZATION]  Amenities include a locking door, heat, running hot and cold water, and 100 square feet of ample living space. We will provide the address along with security codes for the bathrooms and laundry facilities. Mr. [PERSON], would you care to make use of the key for [LOCATION]?"
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"well i don't hear any volunteers so by decree of the people's right to their city remember this you are here by resigning yourself to replacement in the next elections thank you for your service this is your notice good [TIME] uh there's a switch on the button on the base of that there's thank you  I'm PERSON0, CEO of [ORGANIZATION], and on behalf of [ORGANIZATION] and the families we serve, I thank you for your co-sponsors, especially ORG2 and your staff's work on this issue and bringing it quickly through. [ORGANIZATION] encourages your support of increasing the [ORGANIZATION] set aside for affordable housing."
10_28_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"Ownership simultaneously and immediately builds equity while preventing displacement long term. I would also like to recommend, as Commissioner [PERSON] did, that a key focus of these funds be on the development of new affordable housing units that are sized for families with children. A significant part of this housing crisis is that all of the units being added in this building boom are high-end units and that are small."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"The creation of new family-sized affordable housing is critical. That said, I believe an unintended consequence  of the creation of [ORGANIZATION] was the elimination of the city's homeownership development program. Prior to the creation of [ORGANIZATION], the city had a successful PDC program whereby it issued TIP funds [LOCATION] to nonprofits to develop affordable homeownership units for families earning 30-60% MFI."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,Thank you all for coming. Thank you. Thank you for this opportunity to testify on the proposed amendment to the [ORGANIZATION] set aside for affordable housing.
10_28_2015,housing crisis,"We all know that [ORGANIZATION] the citizens of [ORGANIZATION] are experiencing an unparalleled housing crisis that threatens the very heart and future of our city. [ORGANIZATION] and its predecessor, the [ORGANIZATION] Organizing Project, has been training and organizing citizen leaders and taking action on our neighborhoods for [LOCATION]. We have trained over 2,000 new leaders, preparing them to participate in the decision-making process in the public arena, and to give them an opportunity to claim their voice and power, and to bring positive change about in neighborhoods."
10_28_2015,housing crisis; housing insecurity,"We listen to the stories and the pressures that our members are experiencing, and then we organize to take action to relieve those pressures. Over [ORGANIZATION], we have heard hundreds of housing crisis stories from our members who live in every part of the city,  That's why we're here [LOCATION] to support this increase in the tips set aside as the first step in addressing the housing crisis that threatens an ever-increasing number of people who are facing housing insecurity. As our member partners at [ORGANIZATION] remind us, one of the major determinant social factors in family health and well-being is stable housing."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"My name is [ORGANIZATION], representing [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]. These voices were represented to you [TIME] when we presented with  300 postcards of the many people who need a call and need of action for more affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]. I would like to take the time to read some right now."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,And I encourage you to read some as well in your free time. These are really heartfelt stories and personal stories of many people in the community who want more livable and affordable homes. And I encourage you to read them and let this be just the first action in getting more affordable housing within [ORGANIZATION].
10_28_2015,homeless; affordable housing,"One reads, I have worked with families and individuals who are homeless for [ORGANIZATION] and have seen the increase due to the lack of affordable housing. I support an increase in funding for affordable housing using a larger proportion of the tax increment financing. Please remember us, the low-income people of [ORGANIZATION]."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"I've lived here [ORGANIZATION]. Housing is a human right and it is a mark of our civic decency to increase the access to safe, clean, and affordable housing. It is a matter of safety for all and an opportunity to say who we are as a community."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"You know, if you increase the spending that affordable housing set aside, what are we giving up? Give us some say in which part of the budget might, you know, go away. So I'm still thinking that...  even if they weren't [ORGANIZATION] meetings, if we had some sort of [STREET] to reach people."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"Also, I just wanted to say that [ORGANIZATION] and a lot of us who live out in [ORGANIZATION], we are trying to prevent displacement. We haven't gentrified yet. We're trying to put things in [STREET], put affordable housing permanently in [STREET] so that when the prices do start going up in [LOCATION], we retain the affordable housing that we have."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"So we're not against affordable housing. But when you look at [ORGANIZATION], very few households there make more than the median family income. I mean, almost all of the housing that exists in [ORGANIZATION] is affordable housing just by the nature of the fact that it's cheaper there, which is why people are moving there."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"We have a lot of affordable housing. What we need is to put money, instead of building more affordable housing, put money into rehabilitating and converting some of the privately owned properties so that they stay affordable housing when and if the other rents begin to rise. So if you're going to put more money into affordable housing and gateway, I'd say...  prefer to see it go into that [STREET], to rehabilitate, make them better, some of the older housing that we have, and keep it so that it stays affordable housing in the future."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"And one other concern of mine is that the work session that I saw, [ORGANIZATION] said that they would put affordable housing on the property adjacent to the new FAC0, which will be built starting in [ORGANIZATION] or [LOCATION]. Okay. That's not consistent with a master plan that many of us spent a long time developing."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"There are other [ORGANIZATION]-owned properties in [ORGANIZATION]. This is not the [STREET] for affordable housing. We need to put what was planned there so that we can generate more [ORGANIZATION], so that we have more [ORGANIZATION] that you can then put into affordable housing."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"We don't have much of anything that generates [ORGANIZATION], and that project was designed to generate [ORGANIZATION] and should stay that [STREET]. Let me just offer a little bit of reassurance here from my perspective, and that is what each district is...  um contributing to this effort varies widely obviously from district to district the proposal is that there'd be an additional two million dollars we don't have a lot in our fund to start understand that so it's sort of from from each according to their ability um but uh also how we how we address the affordable housing need in each district doesn't have to be the same right so it doesn't have to be a generic project i guarantee it won't be which is why i wanted to you know emphasize that what  our need is and gateway and we've heard much the same concern from [ORGANIZATION] that they have a specific action plan they have certain things that they want to see and so our commitment here is that"
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"yes we're going to raise the total amount of commitment to affordable housing but how we do it in each district  really needs to be involving people from that district, as you've mentioned. That's critical."
10_28_2015,housing crisis,"What about those whose hard work makes our work and our lives possible and comfortable? On our FAC0, the words of [ORGANIZATION] inscribed, Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. so members of [ORGANIZATION] please show fairness compassion vision and love in addition to approving the increased tif set aside continue to work for housing for everyone higher end housing may support our tax base and our attractive public image but housing for everyone supports our humanity we need more than band-aids we need substantive and continuing action and we need it now  Take up that challenge that was alluded to before, the opportunity that the current housing crisis offers."
10_28_2015,homeless,So it's just something that I'm trying to work with on that. And also thank you for the council for working with homeless people also. Thank you.
10_28_2015,homelessness,"it's just i think it is something we would really love to talk to you about because we i think could do a better job of being creative at leveraging all those resources  I spent much of my career, as you know, in the homelessness arena and have a deep commitment to that. It's not to take a cent away from that effort."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"You bet. Mayor, I just wanted, before we move to voting, just to clarify for everybody in the audience exactly what we're voting on [ORGANIZATION]. So we are voting –  DATE1 on the resolution to go ahead with the nexus study, the linkage fee study, that will look at the development's impacts on affordable housing."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"We have this ridiculous situation where taxes are relatively much higher in [ORGANIZATION] than they are in expensive, recently gentrified areas of [LOCATION]. If we had the full tax benefit of that gentrification, we could devote more resources to affordable housing. So absent those tools, we have to look for other tools."
10_28_2015,homeless,"And she was homeless, and she had a bruise on her face. And when she came up to me, she had alcohol on her breath, and she asked me for a dollar. And I hesitated for a second because I instinctively want to help everyone that needs help, but I also want to make sure the money goes to the right person."
10_28_2015,homeless,"And that's why I generally give through trusted nonprofits who then provide the service so that I know that the dollar is being well spent. But she was standing there wet and cold and homeless and alcohol in her breath, and she asked for a dollar, so I, of course, gave her a dollar. And when she left, one of my friends in the table said, you know, shame on the city for not providing a shelter or a home for her.  and instead spending money on, and he rattled off a number of things, as people often do, that they're sort of acting in denial about the fact we don't have enough resources."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"Well, I very much appreciate the council's support for increasing the tax increment set aside from 30% to 45% and generating some $63, $64 million of additional investment in affordable housing. And I do pledge to [ORGANIZATION],  and to the [ORGANIZATION] neighbors, that much like as [ORGANIZATION] suggested, that perhaps we take [PERSON], expand its membership, and use it to provide us  on how we spend those additional housing dollars in a [STREET] that's conducive with the hopes and aspirations of those geographic areas, which includes not only things like homeownership, but also issues around acquisition and rehabilitation versus new construction. And to have all those things factored in before we make the final decision,  budget allocations under this new amount of money that's being dedicated by ORG2 DATE0."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"So I appreciate, again, everybody's support, and this is a significant increase in the amount of money dedicated to affordable housing, and I pledge on behalf of myself and [ORGANIZATION] that we will spend it wisely and effectively. Thank you. Hi."
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"I want to thank all of you who are advocates for this. And I want to second some of the comments that my colleagues have made, starting with taking off Commissioner [PERSON] on one of your points about  and that is it's important to remember that the federal government, when I first arrived at this dais, most of what we were spending on housing was community development block grant money coming from the federal government where that no longer amounts to much. And the city wasn't dedicating property tax dollars to affordable housing like we are."
10_28_2015,homeless; homelessness,"I think all of us have in [ORGANIZATION] just met people. individual neighbors of ours who are victimized by this huge economic change and who are being left behind and who are scared, and in some cases who are homeless or facing homelessness. So this is real and it's personal for those folks, and I hope that it's personal for all of us."
11_21_2018,homelessness,"Item [DATE], request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding homelessness in northwest [ORGANIZATION]. Good morning. Thank you for the opportunity to speak [ORGANIZATION]."
11_21_2018,homeless,"My name's [ORGANIZATION]. I live on FAC0 across from FAC1, which is the home of [ORGANIZATION]. In [ORGANIZATION], we've gone from having one or two homeless people camping in the park to where we have a regular encampment of four to six, sometimes eight, sleeping in the park."
11_21_2018,homeless,"Item [DATE], request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding homeless camps. Welcome. Thank you for being here."
11_21_2018,homeless,"So we're long-term residents of [ORGANIZATION]. And [ORGANIZATION], we started contacting city council because the homeless people were  all over our neighborhood, peeing in our trash cans, sleeping on our front lawn, and nothing was done. We called the police."
11_21_2018,homelessness,"I've reported the homelessness around that property for [ORGANIZATION], and pretty intensely for [LOCATION]. I've been reporting them DATE2, two, three times a week sometimes, for [ORGANIZATION] solid. And this camp of 5 to 15 to 20 tents have been there the entire time."
11_21_2018,homeless,"It's a beautiful parkour gym. We have parents that come here with their kids, trying to be healthy and doing the right thing. A block away, we have homeless camp."
11_21_2018,homeless,I've actually called a broker. We're going to sell our property over there as well because we're done with this. And this final picture is right in front of our gym where some homeless guy decided to use the storm drain as a public toilet.
11_21_2018,homelessness,"I've been very clear in my public statements. I've been very clear in press conferences, online. I give myriads of speeches on what is our strategy around homelessness."
11_21_2018,homeless,"And we've actually got some good –  relationships now with the nonprofit, the faith sector, the business sector, and we're working on basic things, more public restrooms, more porta-potties, more shower facilities.  helping to keep the community clean. We have people in homeless camps who are actually working with us. We hand out trash bags."
11_21_2018,homeless,"Commissioner [PERSON]. Thank you, Mayor. I just want to make sure that people saw the article in [ORGANIZATION] about the decrease in the number of homeless students in [ORGANIZATION] public schools over [LOCATION]."
11_21_2018,homeless,"They're not being a jet plane. They can just go somehow get across the border. I believe this, and this has to do with domestic violence, that [ORGANIZATION] needs to have a center where if immigrants come here and –  People, vigilante types will beat them up if they're homeless."
11_21_2018,homeless,"I think they should go to a central [STREET]. Women of domestic violence need to get their children out of their home and go someplace in the center. I believe the center should be FAC0 for homeless people, for immigrants who are sleeping and they don't have a [STREET] to stay."
11_21_2018,homeless,"So that seems to be the least resistance to, and I'm tired of this fact that people have talked about the [ORGANIZATION] shelter. It hasn't been made yet. So that area is a perfect [STREET] to start some sort of, when I was homeless in [ORGANIZATION], they had a big, giant health care event there."
11_21_2018,homeless,"Name it after [ORGANIZATION] or something, you know, who was in [ORGANIZATION] was Commissioner [PERSON] mentions PERSON2. [ORGANIZATION] and Senator PERSON3 in [ORGANIZATION] did a homeless event near [ORGANIZATION]. And so I believe it's the best use of veterans' property."
12_03_2015,affordable housing,"There's no going back. In a [ORGANIZATION] survey, the residents of that area expressed their discontent with parking, traffic congestion, lack of affordable housing, and boxy modern buildings that seem to rise up from the [STREET]. We can't allow that to happen in the village."
12_03_2015,affordable housing,"These would include townhouses and row houses, three-story apartments and condos with ground floor retail, pocket neighborhood development with duplexes, small single-family homes, and walk-ups on smaller lots with a network of open spaces and buildings oriented to the [STREET]. I think we can accommodate a population increase in a contextually sensitive manner, and I would point to FAC0 as a great example of affordable housing density and community that contributes positively to the neighborhood. Thank you."
12_03_2015,affordable housing,"With narrow [STREET], there are 35 four parking spots in the immediate village and approximately 140 parking spots. Policies need to be created which promote an outcome that mandate developers to create housing which is in the context of the neighborhood  promote affordable housing, and moderate the density which does not degrade the livability of the neighborhood. Other metropolitan areas within the country have addressed this."
12_03_2015,affordable housing,"There's a significant lack of services and quality housing up on [ORGANIZATION] for students and employees of [ORGANIZATION], where 3,000 new students arrive [ORGANIZATION] and need modern, affordable housing on the [PERSON]. The apartments built on the [PERSON] were constructed in [LOCATION] and DATE2. Many of the [ORGANIZATION] single-family homes have been converted to multiple rental units."
12_03_2015,affordable housing,"But it's also clear that to be successful in this, we cannot back away from our principal urban form policy, providing more intensely developed centers and corridors and strategic areas throughout the city. More density is the only [STREET] to accommodate more affordable housing and transportation choices, though it may take different forms in different neighborhoods, the development of intense mixed-use pedestrian-friendly corridors and centers with good transit service while preserving most of the nearby single-family housing is absolutely essential to the creation of a healthy, vibrant [ORGANIZATION] for all. Sorry."
12_03_2015,affordable housing,"and I know you've had a lot of testimony on anti-displacement provisions I just want to take this opportunity to ask you to just say yes to keep the 28 or so provisions that you put in and to thank you for the public involvement anti-displacement and affordable housing work that's been done on this comp plan and I'm just going to ask  I think that neighborhoods have a great opportunity to learn during the process and then to follow through with you as it as it unfolds in the sense that  Every time a project comes before a neighborhood association, there's a robust discussion. And I think the best thing we all can do is familiarize ourselves in advance. [TIME], the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood spent about [ADDRESS] that didn't see us losing those things we love about the neighborhood."
10_02_2019,homeless,"I commend the city of [ORGANIZATION] for adopting [PERSON]'s public safety system by gaining momentum with the new service [ORGANIZATION], a medical and mental public health service. You will be, by default, offer much needed relief to the other two groups of persons on the streets, addicted and homeless. Once you find a solution for addiction crisis, these sufferers will be off the [STREET] and into caring rehabilitation facilities."
10_02_2019,homeless,"We can address the remainder of the homeless by [STREET] of, yes, [ORGANIZATION], the homeless cure. The reason this plan will succeed while others have failed is in part due to its all-inclusive nature. All organizations, public and private, in one [STREET]."
10_02_2019,homeless,"Once evaluated, each person will either be placed in a hospital for physical care, a care facility for the mentally ill, a rehabilitation center for addiction, or the village revitalization community for a home, job, and life skills programs. Only by separating the groups can we go forward with a revitalization plan for [ORGANIZATION]. Homeless by choice, mental health sufferers, and addicted."
10_02_2019,homelessness,"First, mental health and addiction has been and still is [ORGANIZATION] the main reason why homelessness has not been dealt with and must be dealt with separately. If you ask every person who has ever lost a friend or family member to suicide, their comments are nearly all the same. We wished we would have done something sooner."
10_02_2019,homelessness,"But it also had the effect of displacing all the other issues that we as a council need to hear from the public about. We need to hear about housing and homelessness and transportation and equity and police accountability. Unfortunately, the [STREET] things unfolded [ORGANIZATION] was all about the FAC0 budget cuts."
10_02_2019,homelessness,"And these effects include economic impacts that can trap victims in abusive relationships and can continue long after the physical violence has ended, resulting in loss of jobs and housing. In the most recent point in time count for [ORGANIZATION] of people experiencing homelessness, more than one-third of those who responded to the question said that they had experienced and were fleeing domestic violence. Supporting the victims of domestic violence requires resources, partnerships, and collaborations across jurisdictions and systems, including the city, the county, law enforcement agencies, and nonprofit partners."
10_02_2019,homelessness,"Finally, recently I've been thinking a great deal about how to participate in wider movements for social change and social justice. For Domestic Violence Awareness [DATE], I would encourage you to do the same with a focus on the following three truths. First, domestic violence is the number one driver of homelessness for those who identify as women."
10_02_2019,homelessness,"If we want to end homelessness, we must end domestic violence. Second, Second, domestic violence mirrors institutional violence, and our collective work to end systemic oppressions like racism are deeply linked to the prevention of domestic violence. Third, institutional violence rests on a culture of dominance."
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"The agency, of course, develops, owns, and operates a broad range of affordable housing throughout the region. [ORGANIZATION] is the primary oversight body for the agency and is responsible for establishing policy and approving its [ORGANIZATION] budget. [ORGANIZATION] commissioners must have the knowledge and skills to take a comprehensive approach to housing policy and strategy to support the unmet housing needs of Portlanders and families across the county."
10_02_2019,homeless,"And is there any, are there any homeless people on the board? No. I don't know."
10_02_2019,houseless,"And I also have to acknowledge the fact that if 58% of the arrests are of people who are houseless, We really need to change our priorities as far as a police force and actually focus on solving crime and actually not make people criminals who are suffering because they can't afford to live in our city. And so I vote aye, and I look forward to working with the chief to make this report better and to have it really reflect what's happening on the ground in our community. PERSON0."
10_02_2019,affordable housing,We thank them. I commend the bureau's work in gathering feedback from our community in order to develop and update this important proposal. The proposals help accelerate the construction of more affordable housing by offering incentives and bonuses so that different housing options are available for more Portlanders at all income levels.
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"Fourth, to increase through bonuses the supply of affordable housing produced with new development. And lastly, to the best of our ability, to manage the risk of displacement from new development and growth by developing proactive strategies to support people staying in their neighborhoods. [ORGANIZATION] does this for multifamily housing, and this is where we will see most of our growth now through [ORGANIZATION]."
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"I'm not going to get into a whole lot of detail about income issues. I provided a handout that has some more information, but we wanted to give people some sense as to what we mean when we talk about affordable housing or what's affordable to people at various incomes. On the screen, we have a number of income ranges from very low income, up to 30 percent of the area median income."
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"We throw around this term affordable housing as if affordable housing is the same for everybody, right? So thank you, thank you, thank you. This is a clear picture that helps me decide what's affordable for me."
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"I want to make sure that we're going to have family housing in [ORGANIZATION] as well as affordable housing. I don't think the two should be exclusive. The key thing about the proposals to bear in mind is you would still be able to do these smaller numbers of attached housing development, but we would be opening up allowances so you could do other types as well."
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"And the primary [STREET] you get to a bigger scale is providing affordable units. We're increasing... inclusionary housing, bonuses for affordable housing, which is, which provides housing affordable at 60 to 80 percent of area median income, but the greatest bonuses, the biggest priority bonuses are really aiming at that 60 percent of area median income. So these are things that more directly get beyond just what the private sector might do, but but link to ensuring that affordable units are included when you go bigger with development."
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"We also have an allowance where if you commit to preserving existing affordable housing, sometimes what people call naturally occurring housing, you could transfer development rights to another site, go bigger elsewhere. So there's a linkage to preserving affordable housing. Another thing that we have is a bonus through which if you're providing accessible units and of course helping to meet the needs of our our aging population, our disabled population, you would get some bonus to help encourage that."
10_02_2019,affordable housing,Most of our permits and our multi-dwelling zones don't require accessibility. So we're looking at some tools that can increase the physical accessibility. But the biggest priority is getting affordable housing in.
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"Just a little heads up, I'm feeling a little under the weather, so if you hear some sniffles, I apologize. [ORGANIZATION] is pleased to forward our [ORGANIZATION] recommended draft. The [ORGANIZATION] zoning code amendments make fundamental changes to [ORGANIZATION]'s multi-dwelling zones that will help our city meet its future housing needs, including new incentives that prioritize affordable housing."
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] works together with [PERSON] as part of a broader housing opportunities initiative to update the zoning code to expand housing options and address housing affordability while developing strategies to minimize displacement. We at ORG2 believe that development in multi-dwelling zones is important for allowing more people to live close to services and transit. And the proposals included, excuse me, and the proposals include appropriate mitigation measures that will help address [ORGANIZATION]'s need for affordable housing."
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"These amendments provide new regulatory tools that will help expand our housing options, facilitate the development of affordable housing, foster design in outdoor spaces that support quality living environments for residents, and provide new tools for creating needed [STREET] connections in areas that lack them, such as [ORGANIZATION]. Thank you for the opportunity to participate as part of the review of this project and for considering our recommendations. Thank you, Commissioner."
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"This is actually the frame as to why we're doing all the stuff that we're doing. So I think it may be a missed opportunity for those who are here [ORGANIZATION] that we're not setting the context for why are we doing this. Yes, well we certainly through [ORGANIZATION], we are addressing some of the inequities that we're seeing in the city from this history, particularly looking at affordable housing option and providing more opportunities and different additional units and developments in the multifamily zones."
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"As affordable housing is a major goal of this plan, it's important that low income residents enjoy the health and heat island reduction benefits trees provide at home, as do [ORGANIZATION]'s wealthier residents, many of whom live in tree rich neighborhoods. We can have both affordable housing and large trees in our city. Please do not approve additional exemptions from tree planting and preservation requirements for affordable housing reasons."
10_02_2019,affordable housing,Title 11 exempts affordable housing projects from the tree preservation and planning standards that most other development projects must meet. These exemptions further exacerbate the inequities associated with tree deficient neighborhoods. This really is an issue of equity.
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"And so our first point is really that changing terms that are currently maximums in the code to by right or base makes that even less clear for applicants. And so I think what we're asking for is that in historic districts that there be more alerts or or more kind of provisions in the code that actually specifically mention that you have to meet those compatibility standards. Next, that extra FAR, which is the bulk of a building, earned by affordable housing projects, right?"
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"I would say that this is not the right incentive to use within historic districts for that very reason, that sometimes it's hard for a project even to meet the maximums, let alone extra that's earned for a project. And so what I would suggest and what [ORGANIZATION] would suggest, that if we have to say no to some incentive extra earned area of bulk that at least that developer could then incentivize it and transfer it out of the district. I don't want to see us in the position of having to say no to a developer of an affordable housing project and leave them with nothing."
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"I am representing [ORGANIZATION]. I'm a project manager at [ORGANIZATION] and am a developer of affordable housing. As [ORGANIZATION] explained in his presentation, the multi-dwelling zones are well connected to schools, parks, job centers, commercial centers, and multimodal transit."
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"As a result, they are great locations for households of all sizes, all incomes, all phases of life, and And [ORGANIZATION] is a game changer for affordable housing developers. To illustrate the significance of the impacts of [ORGANIZATION], I analyzed the before and after capacity of a five-acre parcel that [ORGANIZATION] owns in northeast [ORGANIZATION]. And five acres is a lot of land."
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"Deeply affordable units serve households at or below 60% of area median income. These are units that are largely financed with low-income housing tax credits, and they are the bread and butter of [ORGANIZATION]'s affordable housing development community. [ORGANIZATION] would be able to increase density on this site by a further 50% to 440 units if we were to redevelop it."
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"The shift to an FAR based system allows greater flexibility in the type and number of housing units developed, which will allow for a greater variety of the housing options in these zones while maintaining an appropriate scale. The properties we have studied would be more likely to be developed and would include more housing units, including regulated affordable units if the proposal is adopted. We support the restructured bonuses, which prioritize affordable housing and family-sized units."
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"But I'm here representing, it looks like this, I'm here representing [ORGANIZATION], which is a community group embracing change to promote livability and inclusivity, sustainability, and climate projection, and we also support housing affordability. Better housing by design, will increase the number of units that can be built near jobs, transit and shopping, which will result in less driving, less carbon emissions. As reached, [ORGANIZATION] said it will promote affordable housing and better housing across the city."
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"We support all the changes proposed, especially the change from unit count to FAR and calculations. This will allow more units and there's also inclusionary zoning and additionally the deep affordability bonus in [LOCATION] that [ORGANIZATION] told you about. We do support FAR transfers to preserve affordable housing and to preserve trees."
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"I think that in a historic district, you look at [ORGANIZATION], they build new big buildings right next to [ORGANIZATION] buildings. But as [ORGANIZATION] testimony, the ORG1 strongly opposes opportunity to earn more bulk in these areas, in other words, get more FAR for having affordable housing, even for deeply needed affordable housing. That's their words."
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"that makes parking that you do have to build more expensive. So if we are requiring parking on some lots, even a small amount, but we're making them more expensive, we're kind of at cross purposes to our goals. We want affordable housing and green development."
10_02_2019,affordable housing,Our neighborhood association has worked to make sure that our board members represent our diverse demographics. Half of our neighborhood association boards are renters and half are low income. All of our low income board members live in [ORGANIZATION] in the naturally occurring affordable housing of mid-rise apartment buildings and big old houses that have been converted to apartments.
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"20% of our board are people of color, We joined [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] in asking you to right-size the zoning to RM free for [ORGANIZATION] and to lower height limits within 1,000 feet of [ORGANIZATION], which touches part of [ORGANIZATION] and would cause demolitions. When we ask for these things, we are asking you to protect the most affordable housing in our neighborhood. Thanks very much."
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"I'm on the board of [ORGANIZATION], but I'm here as the president of [ORGANIZATION]. And we represent [ORGANIZATION]. It's predominantly mid-rise apartments that have our most affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]."
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"We've done a [ORGANIZATION] rental search, and we found that... The apartments in [ORGANIZATION] are half the price per square foot of outside of [ORGANIZATION]. So it is a dramatically affordable area with naturally occurring affordable housing."
09_30_2015,homelessness,Okay.  [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding the city's plan for dealing with homelessness and stable housing. Good morning. Welcome.
09_30_2015,homeless,"And I will say that I signed up to do this ahead of time, so this [ORGANIZATION]'s news and all that's happening may have changed how I wrote this, but I'm going to move forward. I'm concerned about the apparent growing homeless population in our city. I spend a lot of time driving through the industrial east side for my children's various sports practices."
09_30_2015,homeless; affordable housing,"It's just –  you know, sad. DATE0, Mayor, you suggested that the city declare a state of emergency in regard to the homeless crisis. Before this announcement, I was curious what the city's end game was regarding safe and affordable housing for all in [ORGANIZATION]."
09_30_2015,homelessness,"I recognize that homelessness is a multi-pronged problem, or we recognize, involving possible, but not exclusively mental health, as well as physical health issues, possible drug addiction, and lack of employment opportunities. It is hard to imagine addressing those separate issues when folks don't have access to stable housing. With the state of emergency declaration, and then I know we listened to your announcements downstairs."
09_30_2015,homeless,"It seems that shelter beds are only a short-term fix. Rather, radical ideas may be the only [STREET] to influence systematic change in the [STREET] our city reverses the homeless trend. I'm not sure what these ideas might be, but there must be model programs in other cities that have successfully tackled this complex issue."
09_30_2015,homeless,"Great questions, and actually we want to solicit your ideas and also students' ideas because when the council takes up this proposal for declaring an emergency, we're really looking for what tools do people suggest that we use. You've got a city council that's committed to working collaboratively on this issue among ourselves and with the county and with [ORGANIZATION], but we also depend on volunteers a lot, and there are churches and other groups that want to do more in terms of  helping the homeless. So your students' ideas, your ideas over [ORGANIZATION] in particular would be very helpful."
09_30_2015,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] is our staff person who leads this combined effort between the city and the county, so he's going to have a specific plan and proposal for us. But it's basically...  upping our game by a $30 million increment of how much the city and the county are investing into housing and homeless services. Mayor, before we lose this group, could we ask the kids to come out and stand with us and get a picture?"
09_30_2015,homeless,"It is this second group that I would like to focus on [ORGANIZATION]. The problem lies with behaviors, persons choosing to commit crime instead of focusing on specific populations. It's not illegal to be homeless, and I am a homeless rights advocate, but committing crimes is what is illegal, and I think that is what we should enforce."
09_30_2015,homeless,"And so you can see on the handout, I'm advocating for increased foot patrol in [ORGANIZATION], more consistent enforcement of existing laws regarding camping, school zone drug use, etc., reaching out to other cities such as [ORGANIZATION] that has put together some great plans and has had really effective outcomes from their housing the homeless with long-term housing, more aggressive officer recruitment.  and also creating an urgent plan and solution for indoor housing. Thank you. Thanks very much."
09_30_2015,homeless,"Okay. $9.92, please. Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding her backyard homeless transitional camp."
09_30_2015,homeless,"They finally figured out they have homeless in [ORGANIZATION]. So it was packed. We had 150 people there, standing room only."
09_30_2015,homeless; homelessness,"We cannot confuse, which I applaud the gentleman over here, criminality with homelessness. They're not synonymous. The homeless people that I represent do not want the criminals there anymore."
09_30_2015,homeless,"Sometimes their lives involve criminal activity such as drug use. So what I'm saying is we need to be progressive here, and I want to really applaud Mayor [PERSON] over this declaration of emergency for homeless. that is very progressive."
09_30_2015,homeless,Because homeless people provided the intel to get them. They don't want the drug dealers out there. They don't want any of these people out there.
09_30_2015,homeless,People have got to stop confusing criminals with homeless. They are not the same. Thank you.
09_30_2015,affordable housing,"I'm sorry, in [ORGANIZATION]. And we are here [ORGANIZATION] to present an update, which the first report drew on current market data  to provide city council with its first real-time look at the state of [ORGANIZATION]'s housing market. In the second and final phase of the report, we continue to assess the market, but we also look inward and provide an honest self-evaluation of the progress towards the city's affordable housing goals that were established in various planning documents going back to [LOCATION]."
09_30_2015,affordable housing,"A detailed look at [ORGANIZATION] production shows more than 1,100 new units of affordable housing currently in development, including more than 170 targeted towards extremely low-income households. And these 1,100 units represent when they're built, and occupied represent an 8.4% increase in the city's affordable housing supply. But overall, I think as everybody realizes, the picture painted by this report calls for urgency around resource generation solutions."
09_30_2015,affordable housing,"[TIME], I announced that we will shortly be issuing a [ORGANIZATION], or RFP, upwards of $60 million DATE0.  for affordable housing production, which we estimate will fund and construct about 600 more units of affordable housing. And the city and the county have made significant commitments of general fund resources, as well as setting aside our urban renewal dollars. And to reach the goals that represent the values that [ORGANIZATION]ers have for our city, which is to achieve true income diversity in all of our neighborhoods,  to ensure the families that work in [ORGANIZATION] can afford to live in [ORGANIZATION], and to ensure that long-term residents who are living on fixed incomes will have a [STREET], a comfortable, safe and comfortable [STREET] to live when they retire."
09_30_2015,affordable housing,"To achieve these visions that all Portlanders share, we do need more income sources for affordable housing. And towards that end, as I mentioned, we talked about the $60 million we're releasing for investment shortly. We're also in the final stages of crafting an incentive zoning proposal, which will go before council [ORGANIZATION], which could produce upwards of $10 million a year for affordable housing."
09_30_2015,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] will have a chance to increase the amount of urban renewal dollars that is dedicated to affordable housing. And I will be asking the council for a hefty increase in the percentage that we devote because this city needs it. And I'll also be asking to move forward with a linkage fee for affordable housing, which measures a linkage fee study would measure the impact that new developments create on the need for affordable housing."
09_30_2015,affordable housing,"And we would be able, if according to the study goes well, be able to charge developers an assessment based on that impact. And we will reintroduce, late breaking news, the proposal to dedicate the short-term lodging rental tax to affordable housing. We will be bringing that back."
09_30_2015,homelessness,"The, um,  Income disparities are widening significantly. And as mentioned [TIME], homelessness is intractable. Statistically, not increasing, but not diminishing at the level that we would like to see."
09_30_2015,affordable housing,"And while there's a lot of information here I'm not going to cover at all, I wanted to hit the high points first. And I could say that with respect to [ORGANIZATION], the DATE0 Comprehensive Plan and [ORGANIZATION], we're generally meeting targets as it relates to the distribution of affordable housing, the opportunities for racial equity, and accommodating a diversity of household incomes and household types. There are many measures called for in those plans, and we've achieved about half of those measures [LOCATION]."
09_30_2015,affordable housing,"However, on the flip side, the other half of those measures we did not accomplish. The city was preempted in the legislature from enacting excise tax for affordable housing. It has been further stymied in its efforts to –  to link growth and development to affordable housing programs and availability."
09_30_2015,affordable housing,"The financial resources have generally fallen short, and programming outside of the urban renewal areas has fallen short. I want to highlight the central city no net loss policy because I think it really is perhaps the biggest shortcoming to report to you. and that is that there was a very strong aspirational goal to ensure that there was no net loss of affordable housing in the central city."
09_30_2015,affordable housing,"The dedicated affordable units that we're short of. We're seeing growth in [ORGANIZATION], but we're not seeing dedicated affordable units in [ORGANIZATION] to the same proportion that the policy called for. Well, I think that someone in the [ORGANIZATION] area would say that's a good thing, that previously they had more than their share of affordable housing."
09_30_2015,affordable housing,"Just because it's affordable [ORGANIZATION] doesn't mean there's anything in [STREET] to keep it affordable in the future, and that's what the sad story is of the downtown no-net-loss policy. So we could lose those units to the market in [LOCATION] quite easily. So it sounds like you're proposing to build our [STREET] out of losing affordable housing, that the only [STREET] we can keep the housing affordable is for us."
09_30_2015,affordable housing,"I last worked in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], which for [ORGANIZATION] has been doing inclusionary housing for both ownership and rental ownership. there's about 2,700 units of affordable housing on the ground that were developed under their affordable 20-unit ordinance. There's another 4,500 in the pipeline, mostly in the [ORGANIZATION] corridor, which is the metro rail corridor between GPE2 and GPE3"
09_30_2015,affordable housing,"So there's nothing we can do. Can we add additional fees if there isn't affordable housing? Well, the current fee structure, I think, has to be related to actual impacts."
09_30_2015,affordable housing,"Yeah, that's it. Yeah. So we'll continue to track those separately because, you know, sometimes the most affordable housing is the housing you already have, right?"
09_30_2015,homelessness,"A question about homelessness. You used the figure 3,800. What's your citation for that number?"
09_30_2015,homelessness,"You said 3,800 has remained fairly static. It's intractable. And here's the challenge that I think we have talking about homelessness."
09_30_2015,homelessness,"Let's take the period of time on the [ORGANIZATION] plan that we surveyed. If you look at the beginning of the [ORGANIZATION] plan and at the end of the [ORGANIZATION] plan, you look at the data, it's very easy to say there's still homelessness, therefore it's an intractable problem, or if you're predisposed ideologically, you say it was a failure. But during that time, 13,000 people went from the streets to homes."
09_30_2015,homelessness,"And the thing that our vocabulary or our discussion never accounts for is supply. If in the middle of a [ORGANIZATION] plan you have the greatest recession in [LOCATION] and people are being thrown out of their homes and falling into poverty and collapse the mental health system, how do we account for the fact that unlike a lot of other cities where per capita the number has gone up, [ORGANIZATION], record numbers, [PERSON], federal judge saying 50,000 unsheltered, numbers exploding. How do we account for the fact that our programs have created some stability while also acknowledging that any homelessness is still unacceptable?"
09_30_2015,homelessness,"It might even become a federal concern someday. I guess the point I'm saying is that I think the mistake that sometimes happens, not by the advocacy community but by the people that judge us, is that somehow homelessness is static. Therefore, if it starts at a number and ends at a number, we can make a judgment."
09_30_2015,homeless; homelessness,"And I realize it's not even fashionable to say it, but I would be very demoralized if I was an advocate in the homeless movement and I'd move thousands and thousands of people to safe [INSTITUTION], but people keep saying, well, you're failing because there's still homelessness.  because you're not accounting for the fact that you don't control the supply, and you're not really accounting for the fact that you've moved thousands more than the static numbers show. And my analogy is, if you're going to be consistent, then we ought to just say, you know, that because [ORGANIZATION] is a sinner, [ORGANIZATION] has failed, because... Who says [ORGANIZATION] is a sinner?"
09_30_2015,homelessness,But it doesn't mean that we haven't had success with our systems getting people off the [STREET]. It just may mean that we don't control all the factors that push people into homelessness. We don't send people to war.
09_30_2015,homeless,"Any further questions? Just to answer your question on the 3800, it is the [ORGANIZATION] homeless definition from [ORGANIZATION] point in time. Just typically when we produce the data, we're talking about literally individuals on the [STREET] and in shelter."
09_30_2015,affordable housing,"I can say that we will come back to you on a [ORGANIZATION] basis with reports, and we are going to start producing case studies for every one of our funded projects that you have a –  a growing compendium of successful examples of how affordable housing can fit into neighborhoods and how it can help serve our housing needs. So thank you very much for the opportunity to be here. And there are some of those case studies in the back of this report."
09_30_2015,homeless; homelessness,"My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I'm a member of [ORGANIZATION], on whose behalf I speak [ORGANIZATION]. First, I'd like to thank you for producing this informative report. I'd like to return to the topic of homelessness, specifically as it relates to a homeless camp that Mayor [PERSON] has endorsed near the intersection of FAC0 and FAC1 in [ORGANIZATION]."
09_30_2015,homeless,"Safety of people who live in a homeless camp is paramount, but the problems do not end with just their well-being. This is an area that is frequented by pedestrians and bicyclists. We already have heard reports of people harassed and concerned about their safety when passing the campers."
09_30_2015,homeless,"Homeless camp, which almost certainly will host people with substance abuse problems, is not a compatible neighbor for a park. When local organizers first proposed placing a [INSTITUTION] on the site [ORGANIZATION], they assured [ORGANIZATION] that they would not use this as a starting point to develop a homeless camp. They now break that promise with the mayor's approval and help."
09_30_2015,homeless,"City supports neighborhood associations precisely so that they can serve as conduits for information under circumstances like these. [ORGANIZATION] urges you to seek better suited sites to provide services to our homeless population and to support ORG1 in clearing the unsafe homeless camps along FAC0 as soon as possible. We invite you all to attend our next ORG2 board meeting, which will take [STREET] on [ORGANIZATION] at [TIME] in FAC1 to further discuss the issue with the neighborhood."
09_30_2015,homeless,"We're looking for ways to actually help them. We understand the side effects that homeless camps  particularly ones that have no services or sanitation cause for adjacent neighbors. So it would be probably helpful if we cut out the middle people of news media, even the ones that are doing a really good and accurate job, and if you would talk to [ORGANIZATION], I think we could get to some shared understanding."
09_30_2015,homeless,"My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I'm a physician that I live in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood, and I work in [LOCATION] at [ORGANIZATION]. I routinely take care of homeless patients and see the complications that they have, both from their health care that they are not able to care for prior to coming in, as well as when they have to be discharged and go home to the streets where there is unacceptable level of care for them."
09_30_2015,homeless,"I thank you for taking steps moving towards more meaningful long-term solutions for these individuals, but now I'd like to address the immediate concerns specifically of this homeless camp at the [ORGANIZATION] and FAC0 location. As addressed by my colleague here, there's a number of safety issues that I cannot  strongly enough reiterate. The traffic issues there in terms of incidences that can happen between the high flow of traffic, the high speed of traffic, and these pedestrians that result in patients coming to my trauma hospital unable to care for themselves prior to or after discharge is extremely unfair to these individuals."
09_30_2015,homeless,"The completely unsanitary conditions where these individuals have no running water, no toilet facilities, no [STREET] to take care of basic sanitation such as washing their face and brushing their teeth, much less caring for a wound after they've left the hospital, is completely unacceptable. The smoking issues that occur in homeless camps and out in the public, with this very dry ground vegetation that occurs near the risk of a fire across the bluff that would spread far up north [ORGANIZATION] is unacceptable. concerning to all of us that live in the neighborhood."
09_30_2015,homeless,"And the trash is extremely unsightly and unclean, and quite frankly, it's an inhumane [STREET] to encourage people to live. The dignity of all of our fellow citizens who find themselves homeless for whatever reasons, they need a secure [STREET] to live. They need a roof over their heads."
09_30_2015,houseless,"and this whole report is about how are we going to not only provide places for people to live who are currently  experiencing houselessness but also stop the rents from rising so much that even more people get there in the meantime [ORGANIZATION] we're going to have 3,[ADDRESS] in [ORGANIZATION] that could accommodate a dozen or so folks that could be a houseless part of the neighborhood and be a group that would you could perhaps look after and help to endure DATE1 until this adequate shelter for them  I don't think encouraging people from our public officials, encouraging anyone to live outside in an unsafe [STREET] is acceptable. We're not encouraging."
09_30_2015,houseless,"Is there a [STREET] in every one of our 95 neighborhoods? Because I'll tell you, there are people living outside in every one of our 95 neighborhoods now. And so are there ways that we can embrace those folks and help provide some services to them, whether it's porta-potties or garbage cans or whatever it might be, while they are having to be houseless?"
09_30_2015,homeless,I just don't think that we should be endorsing any effort in continuing this. I don't know where this endorse-approve language came from. We have a number of unregulated homeless camps around the city.
09_30_2015,homelessness,So we want to work with you. So don't take our short-term...  emergency efforts or worse are simple enforcement efforts when a property owner wants to clear their property for endorsement or contrary wise for opposition to homelessness it is there it is real it is present we have to act on it
09_30_2015,affordable housing,"It gives us a lot of much-needed information to continue to work with as advocates to continue to call for the action that we need in our community on affordable housing. The missing hole in our community's infrastructure for affordable housing is very clearly here. By our estimates at FAC0, we're missing 23,000 affordable homes for Portlanders."
09_30_2015,affordable housing,"Again, on the report, it gives a great overview of the situation. I thought it was very well done. One of the concerns I have is that I'd like to also see an affordable housing bond."
09_30_2015,affordable housing,"put out their plans. If it's anything to do with affordable housing being built, we need to really focus on that and push for that.  and to get more land for these developers. And the only problem I have with these developers in [ORGANIZATION] is why can't you build your units fast enough?"
09_30_2015,affordable housing,"What is the median income? Median income is what affordable housing is based upon. Now, what is your median income?"
09_30_2015,affordable housing,"And also you have a definition of terms here. You got affordable housing, you got low-income housing, and you got extremely low-income housing. Let me ask you a question."
09_30_2015,homeless,Where does the homeless population fit into any of those definitions? Okay. It's not defined.
09_30_2015,homeless,"So extremely low, it would be below that. So it would be very, just say zero income for people that don't get a check, don't have work. Maybe they're looking for work and maybe they're being disrupted by people that don't like homeless folks."
09_30_2015,homeless,"There's a bill in the state that we may want to consider...  [LOCATION] zone, 3,800 homeless folks. That number can vary. I would say that's a rather conservative number based on what I see out there."
09_30_2015,homeless,"And I've talked to people that, the homeless folks that are at FAC0 as well. And they do have some concerns that I spoke with a couple of them on their concerns. And one of them is the visibility and the [STREET] that the [STREET] and the trails and everything go."
09_30_2015,affordable housing,"Commissioner [PERSON] recently proposed an FAR bonus to incent private developers to build more affordable housing. We also recently have on the table an expansion of the multi-program, raising the cap to $3 million, making it non-competitive. Those are things that are certainly going to help with this effort."
09_30_2015,houseless,"I would like to also talk about the houseless situation, specifically with FAC0. I got the opportunity to take a look at that site and wasn't necessarily really happy with it at all. I understand that a lot of people go through a lot of things, but it definitely was trashed."
09_30_2015,houseless,And how do we make sure that people who were born and raised in [ORGANIZATION] and maybe are now houseless in [ORGANIZATION] have a [STREET] to live for the rest of their lives? I appreciate this conversation. I appreciate the work and the dedication that's going into it.
09_30_2015,homelessness,And this happens all the time. And we find out in those conversations that there are some commonalities around the country. [ORGANIZATION] is struggling with homelessness.
09_30_2015,homelessness; housing crisis,"And the whole room erupted with, we are in a housing crisis. Affordability is going through the roof. And our [STREET] homelessness issue is exploding."
09_30_2015,houseless,"And, yeah, they're going to want to study streetcars and light rail and green roofs and bioswales like all the ones that come here now do. But I also want them to come study how we really move the needle. on housing availability and affordability in a red-hot real estate market and how we really moved the needle on getting houseless people inside and people with mental illness into services and the other things that we're working on."
12_04_2019,affordable housing,"Because I do not meet the criteria of low income or affordable housing, I fall into the market rate units that can only be costly and still not meet my needs. I am not the only one that faces these obstacles. I work on the [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION], and [ORGANIZATION] we get people calling who are medium income and cannot afford a [STREET] to go or need accessible housing."
12_04_2019,affordable housing,"She lived it. I hope that you understand that displacing people from their homes and neighborhoods can leave them without any housing or housing that does not accommodate their needs in order for them to live independently. We now have a low-income and affordable housing that was built on land that was not developed in that area, and this is good."
12_04_2019,affordable housing,"Most importantly, it is a neighborhood of rental units in the missing middle affordable housing category, crucial for the city and most especially for the central city. DATE0, it is a lovely thriving neighborhood. A little history."
12_04_2019,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION].  amend affordable housing code to establish a manufactured dwelling park affordable housing bonus density program. Colleagues, when [PERSON] approved code changes to establish new zoning for residential manufactured dwelling parks, the changes included an option for park owners to pursue a density bonus. The voluntary density bonus is available to parks where at least half of the dwelling units have restricted affordability levels at no more than 60% of median income."
12_04_2019,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] is here before us to establish a new section of Title 30, the Affordable Housing Code section, in order to implement the Density Bonus Program. Welcome. [TIME], Mayor [PERSON], commissioners."
12_04_2019,affordable housing,"It's [ORGANIZATION]. We're referring to as the [ORGANIZATION] program. And as Mayor [PERSON] mentioned, this was implemented into zoning code and allows for a density bonus in exchange for affordable housing with a goal of preserving lower housing cost options that are provided for within manufactured dwelling parks across the city."
12_04_2019,affordable housing,"This is a really, I think, smart and creative approach to generate more affordable housing. I'm really pleased with the work that we've done around protecting residents of manufactured dwelling parks, which come with a unique set of needs and challenges. I vote aye."
12_04_2019,homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION]. Commissioner [PERSON], I think [PERSON] took me on the same tour and some of those manufactured homes on the [ORGANIZATION] were really spectacular and affordable. And let's be clear, this is part of our comprehensive approach to helping people stay in their homes  avoid being displaced in their homes, which often leads to a spiral, including homelessness and other things."
12_04_2019,affordable housing,Next up is [DATE]. Establish standards for bicycle parking for certain city funded affordable housing projects They designed but not yet permitted colleagues. This is also a second reading.
12_04_2019,homelessness,"I happen to wear rose-colored glasses, so I think in terms of if we get them right, some of the really pressing issues in our community around being a leading green city is  addressing homelessness, on and on and on, cleaning up our river. If we get them right, I think we become a singular city of our size. And what's exciting is we're making this history as we go along."
12_04_2019,homeless,"Next item, [DATE].  amend [ORGANIZATION] with [ORGANIZATION] to authorize [ORGANIZATION] revised budget allocation to [ORGANIZATION]. Colleagues, [PERSON] through [ORGANIZATION] has a strong relationship with [ORGANIZATION] in funding [ORGANIZATION]. This partnership is formalized through an intergovernmental agreement between both the city and the county and it was first formed in [LOCATION]."
12_04_2019,homeless,"This amendment to the [ORGANIZATION] revises [ORGANIZATION] annual budget allocation to ORG2, which entails $214,318 in federal carryover funds from the fall bump process and $180,000 in recreational cannabis funds to provide supportive housing capacity and services. We have  The housing program, well, actually we don't. And we have two great people here."
12_04_2019,homeless,"I'm [PERSON], the Deputy Director of [ORGANIZATION]. Thanks, [PERSON]. And I'm joined by [ORGANIZATION] with [ORGANIZATION]."
12_04_2019,homeless,"We are looking to use cannabis resources to expand our supportive housing menu of services delivered by...  addiction and mental health practitioners. That is actually being managed through [ORGANIZATION], and they contract that work out to join a nonprofit that hires a multidisciplinary team of folks who can work with our residents who are living in permanent supportive housing, of city-financed housing.  who need those additional services to deal with whatever issues that arise that may impact their housing stability. In particular, the recreational cannabis tax funds are intended to be used to serve people of color."
12_04_2019,homelessness,"And the other thing I just want to mention is there are a lot of people who are new to this conversation about how we address homelessness, and all of us get emails from people saying, why aren't you doing anything? What's the city doing? And I think one of the answers is to point people to [ORGANIZATION] and say, we have a plan."
12_04_2019,homelessness,"And Mayor, you know, you have a lot of responsibilities. Very little power under our charter, but you have a lot of responsibilities and a lot of relationships that are important. I think this relationship between the city and the county, between the mayor and the county chair, over how we're addressing homelessness is...  is a paramount relationship."
12_04_2019,homelessness,"And it is very important to our city that the county chair and the mayor continue to collaborate at a very high level in addressing our number one problem, which is [STREET] homelessness. So thank you for your work and the presentation. I'm pleased to vote aye."
12_04_2019,homeless,"Many, many other people who worked in [ORGANIZATION] and in the county's infrastructure and elsewhere  to make sure that the joint office would work. And while there definitely have been some growing pains and bumps along the [STREET] and an evolution in thinking, as we better understood what worked to address the homeless situation, this is still a nationally regarded model. I mean, I cannot go to a meeting of national mayors where people do not ask about this model and how it's working, how it was created, how it is evolving with time to meet the needs in our community."
12_04_2019,homelessness,"And in large measure, because of the success of this model, I am very confident that we will end homelessness in our community. It won't be easy. And it won't be quick, but I am confident that through [ORGANIZATION], we have established the right practices around prevention, around shelter, around how to best transition people into housing, and how to keep people successful in housing by creating the support services they need to be successful in that housing, whether it's addiction treatment or mental health services or job training, domestic violence survivor services, whatever."
11_04_2015,affordable housing,"So [ORGANIZATION] decided to jointly undertake this plan for the [ORGANIZATION] area to bring together creative solutions and create a tailored strategy for dealing with access and stormwater in the context of [LOCATION]. So we started by developing a public involvement plan  uh looking to the examples of cully and division midway as models the public involvement plan identified community stakeholders and outreach activities based on demographic data for the study area we translated key materials based on portland public schools data into spanish and somali we formed a diverse stakeholder working group that  included representatives from neighborhood associations and business associations, and then also from groups such as [ORGANIZATION], ORG2, and resident of [ORGANIZATION], which is one of the home-forward affordable housing communities in the plan area. The project was kicked off of the booth and a walking tour at [LOCATION] Sunday Parkways."
11_04_2015,homelessness,"It's a moment where instead of reacting to crises, we get to look upstream and figure out how we prevent them. The city faces many challenges, and among those challenges certainly is the challenge of homelessness, challenges of food insecurity, challenges of behavioral health care. The [ORGANIZATION] initiative, which is a partnership with [ORGANIZATION], ORG2, and [PERSON],  is one of those upstream solutions."
11_04_2015,housing crisis,"So as bad as it is, there is the possibility of it becoming worse. So again, [ORGANIZATION] will speak to that, but I just wanted to –  take the opportunity to say that commissioner [PERSON] and his staff and the [ORGANIZATION] staff have been really tremendous partners in helping us look at this issue and the investment request before you  is one of a number of ways that we are working to address this issue both sort of programmatically and at policy levels. So know that we are working hard in all of the ways that we are partnered together around working through this housing crisis that we face."
11_04_2015,homeless,"These are the folks that would be homeless without our help. And unfortunately, even those with vouchers are struggling as they're being asked to move due to an increase of affordability issues in utilizing that voucher. I wanted to provide you with a few current data points that are effective right now [ORGANIZATION] to help put this in perspective for you."
11_04_2015,homelessness,"And it's more important than homelessness because –  [ORGANIZATION] of homelessness can hopefully end in [LOCATION]. It's more important than income inequality because we proved from DATE2 that spectacular income inequality, horrible as it is, can change in [LOCATION]. What we're doing to the planet, if we continue doing it, cannot be changed in [LOCATION] or two or ten or a hundred."
11_04_2015,homeless; affordable housing,"I think it's problematic. I do believe that...  in the other resolution that Mayor [PERSON] has put forward that I believe that when you say that they'll be actively opposed and you're looking at codes to actually change the [STREET] [ORGANIZATION] does business, I think, and I've sat in these rooms and I've heard from all of you folks about the needs of [ORGANIZATION], of we need affordable housing, we have a homeless issue, we have a [STREET] and infrastructure issue, and I think that's a very poor steward of the taxpayers' money to [STREET] a special interest  Fight on the burden of the taxpayers because basically what [ORGANIZATION] is doing is taking on the fight of special interests I believe that these resolutions are bad for jobs. They're bad for business"
09_28_2016,houseless,"We don't want the same old, same old. We don't want the robocops on our [STREET]. What we want are police officers who have cultural competency, that know the community they police, that are respectful of all people, regardless of whether they are houseless, whether they are people of color, whether they are children in our communities."
09_28_2016,homeless,"And actually, the [STREET] to cut down crime would be to send some drug addicts out of town to...  [ORGANIZATION] or [PERSON] to go to an Ibogaine treatment center and deal with their addiction. And then that would reduce crime alone. Actually dealing with addiction and crime in a meaningful, progressive [STREET] that is actually there to heal things.  instead of putting people in jail over stupid, low-level offenses, and then using them as inmate slave labor to clean up homeless camps and stuff like that, which goes on all the time, you know?"
09_28_2016,homeless,"As [ORGANIZATION] has progressed, I realized that stopping this contract is the most important thing that we can do if we are really talking about saving lives in this city. When we talk about [ORGANIZATION], when we talk about [ORGANIZATION], this is a direct intersectional effort. opportunity for us to really show that it does matter."
09_28_2016,houseless,"But [ORGANIZATION] has given you the chance to create your legacy, [PERSON]. You know, he also has a 10-point plan for the houseless. But he hasn't come in."
09_28_2016,affordable housing,"okay thank you all very much good work let's move on to the polled item which was [DATE] Authorize the city attorney to take action, including but not limited to initiating legal proceedings against [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] for breach of affordable housing property development contracts, recovering unpaid cash flow loan payments, and compelling contractual reporting requirements. PERSON2's not here to talk about this item."
11_07_2019,homeless,So we appreciate what you've done and the work that goes on here. We'd like to see the homeless people taken care of. And I know you've had a great deal of experience and work in trying to figure out the solution.
11_20_2019,homeless,That their homeless burned down [ORGANIZATION]. They're won eight million dollars But I'd like to get your thoughts and making a canoe and [ORGANIZATION] on that site It's a wonderful site for facilities for lower income kids that need a facility versus the facility down there by FAC0 and the LCI 713 restored [ORGANIZATION] ship is also a [ORGANIZATION] that would like to be at that site.
11_20_2019,homeless,"Thank you. Next individual please, [ORGANIZATION]. Item [DATE], request of PERSON1 to address [ORGANIZATION] regarding business owner homeless situations."
11_20_2019,homeless,"The [ORGANIZATION] uses its taxpayer money to fund board members private business, social enterprises, and pet projects $2,000 at a time. Since our inception in [ORGANIZATION], we have been accused of being nimby and violent towards the homeless population. We are just the opposite."
11_20_2019,homeless,"We have helped people by taking them to emergency rooms, talked to them as people, and recently assisted a homeless person navigate the registration process and got him into services. Our first cleanup was around the [ORGANIZATION] grade school. Our first and last city grant was for a neighborhood cleanup, which took us [ORGANIZATION] to get reimbursed for."
11_20_2019,homeless,"We built entry stairs for another couple, helped do yard work and interior painting for [ORGANIZATION], spent [ORGANIZATION] clearing the brush and weeds from FAC0, helped paint one woman's house who could not afford to hire a professional painter. We regularly partner with the local church's Neighbor to Neighbor program. Many of their care receivers are referred to them by ORG1 due to code violations."
11_20_2019,homeless,"Sometime we should talk, just the two of us. Fair enough. [ORGANIZATION] Mayor on misconduct by homeless people."
11_20_2019,homelessness,"Laws will be enforced. And...  This is the recent survey. According to respondents, homelessness is perceived as the top challenge facing [ORGANIZATION]."
11_20_2019,homeless,"In your announcement to run for mayor, you can't claim to be progressive if you're not making progress on helping homeless to get off the streets. And this surprised me. This is [ORGANIZATION] right now, [ORGANIZATION], and it says [ORGANIZATION] ranks 49th for access to drug and alcohol treatment."
11_20_2019,homeless; homelessness,"It also continues and increases the dollars available to attract major conventions to our city by increasing support for [ORGANIZATION]. And made possible by the hard work and success of the travel and tourism industry in our city, this amendment reflects that the ORG1 is now able to dramatically increase the tourism-generated dollars that go towards services and programs that support our most vulnerable populations, those that are either experiencing or at the risk of experiencing homelessness. In other words, to provide services to the most chronically homeless to help them get off  and stay off the streets."
11_20_2019,homeless; homelessness,"So first, consistent with the community livability and safety priority, two allocations are dedicated as new funding for the provision of services and programs for people experiencing homelessness or who are at risk of becoming homeless and to address community livability and safety concerns often associated with homelessness. The first renames an existing allocation in the agreement called [ORGANIZATION] to [ORGANIZATION] base amount. This allocation in [ORGANIZATION] is $1,775,000 and that amount is escalated by [ORGANIZATION]."
11_20_2019,homelessness,"And more than quadruples the funds available from this source available to support services and programs related to homelessness needs. Second, consistent with the healthy facilities priority in the letter of agreement, several changes are included in the amendments. The first, this agreement includes new bond support for capital renovation projects at key city-owned venues."
11_20_2019,homeless; affordable housing,"With this visitor fund [ORGANIZATION] agreement before you [ORGANIZATION], we want to renew and update our long-standing partnership to bolster that tourist economy and also fund programs that will move  hard to serve homeless individuals into permanent housing. With two affordable housing bond measures approved over [LOCATION] by the voters in [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], we are working hard to acquire and build more affordable homes. I'm here to report that we have approved on an initial basis about 10% of what the voters had said that they wanted to build the 3,900 units for 12,000 people."
11_20_2019,homelessness,"So by hopefully [ORGANIZATION] we will start to see some shovels in the ground on about 345 units to start towards that goal. So that's an exciting start to this program. A critical part of succeeding in the fight against chronic homelessness is identifying funding for permanent supportive housing, providing services and support once someone is housed."
11_20_2019,homelessness; affordable housing,These new funds from taxes on tourists will be a welcome infusion of resources to match the city and metro affordable housing bond resources. We are at our best when we work in partnership to tackle tough issues. The investment of resources from tourism will not solve the homelessness challenge by itself.
11_20_2019,homeless; houseless,"For the record, I'm [PERSON] with [ORGANIZATION]. Accessibility is really the focus of the project. And so the public restroom was an idea that came out of the mayor's office and the idea there is really making that site accessible for the homeless and houseless population in the community."
11_20_2019,homeless; houseless,"So I agree with everything you said about, except when you talked about ride shares. Do we have any data that shows that houseless people who don't own automobiles actually use [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] and those kind of... Oh, I was thinking more about, I wasn't thinking about the homeless and houseless community there."
11_20_2019,houseless,I was thinking about the low-income community who are using public transit to get around and who come into [ORGANIZATION] perhaps for work or for tourism. I don't think we have data. I certainly don't have data on whether the houseless community uses [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] to get around.
11_20_2019,unhoused,I appreciate also that the ordinance directs [ORGANIZATION] to work with development services and transportation to see what's needed to update the code as Commissioner [PERSON] just alluded to. Thank you also for a lot of the thinking about how to make sure that the [INSTITUTION]-a-party is attended 24-7 to make sure that the zoning code is addressed. um address some of the issues that we've seen on [DATE] water corridor and elsewhere where probably housed people are unkind to people who are unhoused and vandalize the [INSTITUTION]-a-potties which is so sad um i appreciate also that you thought about um having a needle disposal and decided ultimately with the county's um approval to not do that but again this is a pilot so we can look at it and thanks also for working with [PERSON] and the park rangers and to  learn from them about some of the challenges that we've had in these kinds of spaces.
11_20_2019,houseless,"This is a great step forward, thank you, aye. [PERSON]?  I also look forward to seeing how usable this pilot project will be for all the needs in the [ORGANIZATION] area where this pilot will take [STREET]. I'm hopeful that there will be opportunities to hire houseless people."
11_20_2019,homeless,"I'm looking forward to a time, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] homeless down well, I'm looking forward to a time when pedestrians have more clout and more power to Have some greater say I'm looking for a reduction in cars. I'm looking for a time when [ORGANIZATION] riders will come in and feel they're being discriminated against because they have to watch out for pedestrians and"
11_20_2019,affordable housing,"I wanna thank you for supporting initiatives like [ORGANIZATION] so that people of color entrepreneurs have a best chance to be successful in creating small businesses and thriving. And I want to thank you for supporting initiatives in the J district, roughly 25% of [ORGANIZATION]'s Asian American community lives in this one neighborhood. So thank you for the investments in affordable housing, community health clinics, safety improvements, and economic empowerment."
11_20_2019,affordable housing,"Could you read those together, please, [ORGANIZATION]?  update bicycle parking regulations and amend fee schedule for land use services. [DATE], establish standards for bicycle parking for certain city funded affordable housing projects designed but not yet permitted. Alright, so we're here [ORGANIZATION] to follow up on the bicycle parking code update project."
11_20_2019,affordable housing,"This amendment listed number one on the amendment list. It inserts language to exempt a defined list of affordable housing projects that are currently in the development pipeline. This amendment is supported by the second ordinance we heard [ORGANIZATION], which establishes alternative bicycle parking standards for the exempted projects."
11_20_2019,affordable housing,"As mentioned [ORGANIZATION], this solution acknowledges a unique budget and timeline of these pipeline projects that have developed their financing packages based on current bicycle parking standards while still ensuring that these affordable housing projects include bicycle parking. Very good. Any question or discussion on Commissioner [PERSON]'s Amendment No. 1? Anything else from staff on that?"
11_20_2019,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]. You know, I've been to [PERSON] and it pains me to say that I can go to a country that doesn't have the budget that [ORGANIZATION] has and find out they have better public transportation. And I'm sure you all have been to other countries as well where you discovered, hmm, they have a smaller budget and a more faster maneuverable responsive transportation bureau."
11_03_2016,affordable housing,"I hope the council will show leadership in adopting the final version of this proposal, trusting that if our community doesn't agree, voters will pursue the referral option. Now, some say that this is not the most urgent challenge we're managing compared with funding shelters and permanent affordable housing, building community trust in the police bureau and other difficult problems. And I agree."
11_03_2016,affordable housing,"Whether or not that's true in every instance, I think it is a problem because it means that we're not only not addressing that credibility, but we're making it more difficult and putting up barriers for people who would like to run for office or even for ourselves. Because which of us really enjoys dialing for dollars during election time and spending half of our time doing that as opposed to the work that we're elected to do? Whether it's solving affordable housing or transportation or any of the true challenges that we all ran for office to be able to address."
11_03_2016,affordable housing,"The struggles and the success of many families are imprinted in the history of [ORGANIZATION]. [DATE], we face many obstacles such as affordable housing, equal opportunity and employment, and moving towards breaking the cycles of generational poverty. The immediate focus on these issues have kept many members of our community distant from engaging in the political process and the development of policies."
11_03_2016,homeless,"Teachers and students, middle class homemakers and homeless veterans, high school students, blue collar workers, millennials and seasoned activists. It has been an eye-opening experience to say the least. and an amazing one, but so many of these people, literally thousands, had either never engaged in the political process or had gone [ORGANIZATION] since they had been involved."
11_03_2016,homelessness,"Thank you for having me and listening to us [TIME]. I'm here on behalf of [ORGANIZATION]. I'm a staff at [ORGANIZATION], and I also come before you with my experience as a woman who was born and raised in the [ORGANIZATION] metro area, as a former city employee who worked to help complete [ORGANIZATION]'s largest citywide community visioning process, ORG2, as a volunteer who has contributed [TIME] of service on community and city commissions and boards,  And as a leader who has helped ensure communities of color and people experiencing homelessness, houselessness, had and have a say in the [ORGANIZATION] [INSTITUTION] Superfund cleanup process."
11_03_2016,homeless,"Right near here, you probably heard about it. But that's basically what we were trying to say, is that we really need to get big money out of politics, especially right here where we live, because that's where the homeless people live. That's where we live."
11_03_2016,homeless,"That's where we need to work really hard. So this is personal to me, having worked in the homeless field, volunteered in the homeless field, because I've seen it firsthand, and we talk about it often,  it all the time when we look at our city leaders and we look at everybody's [ORGANIZATION] accounts and we talk about recall elections. That's the first thing we're going to do is say how many developers has been participating with them politically and is there pay for play here?"
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"Hello there, my name is [ORGANIZATION] and I'm an affordable housing developer at [ORGANIZATION]. DATE0, I am testifying on behalf of ORG1 ORG2."
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] is made up of a diverse set of affordable housing organizations. We are largely supportive of the [ORGANIZATION] recommended draft with suggestions described in our submitted testimony of how [ORGANIZATION] can better support affordable housing. Specifically, we recommend an amendment to allow all affordable housing, defined as 100% of units up to 60% [ORGANIZATION], to utilize a Type 2 review process, and importantly, be entitled to full height and FAR from the base zone."
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"The affordable housing process is markedly different from and less flexible than that of market developments. Decreases in review time and removing risk of high impact, costly changes, which could derail a project late in the review process, helps public dollars go further and opens the door for providing affordable housing where it previously been considered too risky or infeasible. all while providing thoughtfully designed additions to historic areas and increasing opportunities for adaptive reuse of historic buildings"
11_03_2021,affordable housing,". However, to ensure that [ORGANIZATION] is as effective as possible to aid the development of affordable housing, we support funding future work to update design guidelines in historic districts. Unless that occurs, unnecessary ambiguity and uncertainty will remain in the process."
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] amendments and funding requests would first explicitly give ORG1 the ability to consider past racial exclusion as a criterion for resizing, demoting, or removing a district's historic or conservation status. Second, help developers, especially affordable housing developers, secure financing for new housing projects by limiting uncertainty in the approval process. Third, expand the idea of the city's built history to include sites important to a wide array of marginalized groups rather than just the craftsman bungalows of the wealthy."
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"This certainty is especially important for financing affordable housing. Amendment number three, change all historic resource type three reviews to type two staff reviews. This is both faster, less expensive, while preserving discretion of [ORGANIZATION] should a project be appealed."
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"All right, great. To those who've literally said, burn it down, there are many inclusive ways we can add more affordable housing here in [ORGANIZATION] and other historic districts without demolishing the oldest homes. For example, adaptive reuse."
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"Otherwise, the only housing added will be market rate, which defeats the stated aims. Notice the lot on FAC0 added a duplex with each unit now listed for $800,000. We can look to FAC1 for a shining example, adding to a historic building site more than 100 units of affordable housing because the city is giving $20 million in subsidies."
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"We were pleased to know that our newly adopted city, like [ORGANIZATION] we had just left, had an appreciation for preserving and protecting its history and celebrating its craftsmen and artisans. [ORGANIZATION] has had a strong history of providing affordable housing, which is apparent in the 2200  multi-family units in the historic district. We have many examples of adaptive reuse, such as duplexes and triplexes carved out of original single family houses."
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"We all want that we want affordable housing, but at the expense of people who work very hard like a few homeowners have spoken before me have said,  to get to the pinnacle of a beautiful city, a beautiful home, work hard. This is where your kids go to school. And then for that to suddenly be endangered by a few houses around us that could be razed and turned into condos  with the attended parking issues and really just the loss of character."
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"They're highlighted in aqua. These neighborhoods are close to jobs, transit and amenities and have complete streets and sidewalks. But historic district rules make it very difficult to build affordable housing or any mobile family housing whatsoever."
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"According to [ORGANIZATION] report, these areas should encourage infill development and higher density housing opportunities, especially affordable housing. And this is a large amount of area in [ORGANIZATION] to be almost entirely to make it very difficult to build any new higher density housing or affordable housing. So this is our First Amendment, which is to include a history of racial covenants as a reason to-  I apologize."
11_03_2021,homelessness,"Through our current challenges, our protests, the homelessness, the [PERSON] pandemic, there's been a gratifying renewal of everyday life all over the city's neighborhoods. In many ways, our neighborhoods have served as an anchor to [ORGANIZATION] in these challenging times. DATE0 may have shown us that we take too many things for granted, including the value all around us in our diverse and wonderful neighborhoods."
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"I encourage you to welcome new neighbors to your community. As an affordable housing policy professional, I know that the only [STREET] to build housing that is truly affordable to households earning less than 80% of the area median income in a major [ORGANIZATION] city like [PERSON] is to publicly subsidize it. Preserving exclusionary communities in a [STREET] that prevents new market rate and subsidized development will increase median rents."
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"The recently approved [ORGANIZATION] project clarified that [ORGANIZATION] cannot reduce the height or FAR of a new development below what is allowed in the zoning code. ORG2 plays the same role as [ORGANIZATION] does when a new building is proposed in a historic district, and yet this code package has no parallel language. In my professional work, I've worked with developers of both market rate and affordable housing, and one thing that they have in common is that in order to move forward, they need certainty."
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"So in order to diversify our neighborhood, we need to have more affordable housing here. And I really appreciate you considering doing that here in [ORGANIZATION] and specifically in these historic neighborhoods. Thank you so much."
11_03_2021,housing crisis,"Wealthy neighborhoods such as [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] have already stated their intent to use the historic preservation process to exempt themselves from the residential infill project [ORGANIZATION] adopted [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]'s housing crisis affects each and every one of us, and it is the responsibility of every neighborhood to do its part in solving this. No neighborhood should be allowed to say, not our problem, and pass the buck to the rest of the city."
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"We need affordable housing, we need market rate housing, and it has to be in the rich neighborhoods and the poor ones and everything in between. Okay. What I'm concerned about is that if we don't change our historic codes, it could be used as a loophole by the most privileged neighborhoods in the city to basically circumvent this admirable policy that council passed [ORGANIZATION]."
11_03_2021,housing crisis; affordable housing,"Recent experiences in allowing subdivisions and apartment buildings have not lowered housing prices as the resulting properties just created more high-rent townhomes and apartments. Let's take the two new townhomes built on the corner of FAC0 and FAC1. They were touted as a solution to the affordable housing crisis, putting two structures where there was previously one single family home  Those two townhomes just went on the market for $849,000 and $799,000 respectively."
11_03_2021,housing crisis,"These houses and neighborhoods are what give [ORGANIZATION] its character and make it a [STREET] people want to live. Once destroyed, it cannot be replaced. If [ORGANIZATION] is serious about solving the housing crisis, rezoning [PERSON] is not the [STREET] to go about it."
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"We can tell you that it did not result in more or better access to affordable housing, but it did make a lot of developers a lot of money as they took down old modest homes and replaced them with very expensive new developments. These changes did not make housing any more accessible or affordable, but it did dramatically and negatively impact the character of our neighborhood. And once that is gone, it's gone forever."
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"The inner east side is already overburdened by air pollution and suffers the heat island effect. Further reducing the tree canopy will only worsen pollution and climate impacts on our communities. Second, and more importantly, the proposal will not accomplish the goal of increasing affordable housing."
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"There are no provisions that require any new housing to be built that is more affordable than the housing it is replacing. All over the city, particularly the east side, I see existing affordable housing being torn down, renters evicted, and new luxury homes being built. This is only furthering gentrification of our neighborhoods."
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"I haven't seen any convincing data that [ORGANIZATION] has improved the affordable housing situation in [ORGANIZATION]. On the contrary, housing costs have continued to rise unabated. If the goal is more affordable housing and increased equity, this proposal is not the [STREET] to make that happen, and it doesn't reflect the economic reality."
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"First include a history of racial covenants as the reason for council to resize, demote, or remove a district's historic [STREET]  historic or conservation status. Do not allow communities to exclude building of more affordable housing if they have a history of segregation or exclusion. Second, allow historic resource review to reduce a building's height, FAR, or envelope by no more than 10%."
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"Staff reviews allow for more predictability and thus allow more affordable housing to be financed in areas that would be perfect for dense housing along corridors and transit routes. Fourth, expand approval criteria for demolition review in [ORGANIZATION] districts to the maximum allowed by state law. Protect genuine historic assets while following a review process that will allow for...  and affordable housing density if a building is to be demolished."
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"By learning about each other, we build bridges. We must protect against pressures of demolition for profit. Older building stock is also a rich source of affordable housing."
11_03_2021,housing crisis,"Many [ORGANIZATION] residents don't have that. We have a lot of problems in [ORGANIZATION] right now, including a housing crisis. I don't think we should be giving more protection, more time and energy to protecting the wealthiest, most exclusive neighborhoods."
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"We need to be concerned about getting people out of their carbon emitting cars and encourage them to walk more and preserving existing pedestrian friendly neighborhoods and insisting that new development be more pedestrian friendly are two things that the city should do. Finally, although we need more and more affordable housing, it's not necessary to trash one community asset to create another. I'd just like one example of a preservation housing collaboration, and that's the historic manhouse in [ORGANIZATION], which is being renovated and converted into 129 units of affordable housing."
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I fully support adoption of the [ORGANIZATION]. I would like to offer three points in response to some of the amendments advocated for [ORGANIZATION]. First, entitling height at FAR as a matter of right for affordable housing is a bad idea because [ORGANIZATION] must have the ability to sculpt by providing setbacks or step backs on buildings."
11_03_2021,unhoused,"And having lost the battle in zoning reform, they're turning to historic preservation as their tool for exclusion. Historic preservation abused is a theft from the unhoused. This council is right to consider reforming it, but to ensure that exclusionary neighborhoods cannot use the historic preservation process to opt out of [ORGANIZATION] and other reforms, the council must act to strengthen the proposal."
11_03_2021,housing crisis; affordable housing,"So our landlord could build two apartments without going through extra hoops and spending extra money to conform to historic code. Thanks to that ability to build reasonably priced, gentle density, my partner, myself, and our cat live in an affordable apartment in a walkable, bikeable, and transit-friendly neighborhood, a rare thing in [ORGANIZATION]. With the current affordable housing crisis in [ORGANIZATION], I wholeheartedly support the amendments from [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and [ORGANIZATION]."
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"They would allow thoughtful historic preservation while making it harder for historic districts to become obstacles to lower cost and affordable housing. Again, thank you for your time. Next up is [ORGANIZATION]."
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"They're not getting in the [STREET] of affordable housing, particularly. Not every site needs to be the same. Affordable housing needs to be a priority but can be provided without trashing existing lower cost housing units."
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"Those of us who have struggled to find and afford homes in close-in neighborhoods in [ORGANIZATION], who are starting families, compared to the perspective of those who bought their homes [LOCATION], we simply need more housing. We need more affordable housing. We need more middle income housing."
11_03_2021,homeless,"And you know, that where my children can grow up and afford to live. You know, I see the homeless encampments that we saw in circling the playground block at [ORGANIZATION] as connected to this question. Instead of adapting to a growing population, too many people are looking for ways to keep people out."
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"The solar panel changes should actually be enacted immediately because the climate emergency outweighs all these discussions for [TIME]. And while we're already quite dense compared to other neighborhoods, we welcome even more density through the [ORGANIZATION] changes, which contrary to testimony, we are not trying to avoid. However, making it easier to demolish homes will not result in any additional affordable housing."
11_03_2021,housing crisis,"When my guests see ugly, when my guests see ugly, super expensive new properties cropping up right near me and my neighborhood and beyond, in [STREET] of the historic treasures that had just been there, but are now gone forever, that hurts the most. We keep being told that [ORGANIZATION] has a housing crisis,  But are people who can afford to pay for housing, sleeping in tents all around town? No, we have a income and cost of living crisis."
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"Eight, preservation attracts investment in unstable and declining neighborhoods  [PERSON] is an expression of appreciation and provides soul to every [STREET] where it's practiced. And finally, and very importantly, all historic preservation districts comprise less than 3% of [ORGANIZATION]'s buildable land area. They contribute to housing affordability by preserving existing housing stock, which is often the most affordable housing,  curbing speculative upmarket redevelopment, and discouraging demolition and displacement."
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"In fact, we all want beauty and we should strive to make it available to everyone everywhere. It's also important to clearly state what our long-term goals are. If we have a goal of affordable housing closer into the city center, that's good."
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"Good [TIME]. I'm [PERSON], a nonprofit affordable housing developer at [ORGANIZATION]. As a member of [ORGANIZATION] and its ORG2, [ORGANIZATION] wants to reiterate our support of their submitted testimony."
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"I also want to sincerely thank our affordable housing colleagues who have thoughtfully collaborated on these requests. Among other things detailed in the housing organ letters, the emphasize need for predictable and efficient review processes and criteria in order to reduce unnecessary risk to affordable housing developments and to increase the efficient provision of affordable homes. The reality is currently affordable housing developers often preemptively reduce the number of homes they propose in these areas to minimize risk, while many others don't even consider developments in these areas due to the disproportionate uncertainty of the current process."
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"With that in mind, we echo the amendment request for affordable housing to have the option of a type two review process with entitled heightened [PERSON]  I also want to emphasize the high importance of near-term future funding to update historic district guidelines. Without this, many of the well-intentioned updates could be watered down. We want to provide affordable homes that are responsive to and respectful of the surrounding context."
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"Help us do that by clearly defining what those expectations are and refining the scope of the guidelines. As we look to the future of historic designations, we want to emphasize that not only will the recommendations noted provide affordable housing in currently designated areas and structures, but it also helps ensure affordable housing can be provided in future historic resources to help prevent future displacement and vulnerable residents, taking [ORGANIZATION]'s preservation efforts in a direction that is much more equitable and responsive to the needs of all [ORGANIZATION]ers. And I just want to briefly touch on the comments that repurposing historic buildings is a more cost effective [STREET] to provide affordable housing."
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"I know everybody's getting tired, myself included. You know, I'd like to just say, I think everybody at this meeting is passionate about creating more affordable housing. And as a residential real estate agent in [ORGANIZATION], I can tell you that a lot of the affordable housing stock in [ORGANIZATION] does actually reside in the older buildings and not in the new apartment complexes."
11_03_2021,homelessness; affordable housing,And a brief comparison of rent reveals that a lot of the new apartment buildings are significantly more expensive than the older homes and apartments and a lot of the new luxury buildings.  and market rate buildings that are being built are not filling the gap for affordable housing. And a lot of the demolitions that building these new buildings  has created a lot of displacement and it contributed to the homelessness situation in the city.
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"But I've also seen how anti-housing homeowners in affluent neighborhoods like [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] have used the historic preservation process to fight affordable housing in these neighborhoods. I urge the council to reject these attempts by the wealthy, whether they view themselves as wealthy or not. If you live in a neighborhood with million dollar homes, you and you own one, you are wealthy.  to reject these attempts to subvert [ORGANIZATION] and take this step towards a more equitable and affordable city."
11_03_2021,homelessness,"I'm here [ORGANIZATION] to express support for the goals of the [ORGANIZATION] and to urge you to go further  to ensure that historic preservation cannot be used to exempt certain neighborhoods from those recent pro-housing, pro-tenant reforms by adopting the positive amendments proposed by [ORGANIZATION]. I also want to endorse the testimony of many great folks from [ORGANIZATION], as well as [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION], [LOCATION], PERSON3, and others. From housing affordability and homelessness to climate change to mass transit effectiveness, adding density, especially in close-in neighborhoods near and those near major transit corridors, will go a long [STREET] towards helping us meet the challenges our city faces [ORGANIZATION]."
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"Good [TIME], Mayor and Commissioners. My name is [ORGANIZATION]. Currently, if inclusionary housing is triggered in historic districts that do not have a design overlay zone designation, no extra height is granted to offset the requirement for affordable housing."
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"This generally makes the increased FAR unusable and is stopping the development of affordable housing on non-historic sites within many historic districts. Historic districts that happen to have a design overlay zone are getting both height and FAR, but those without an overlay do not, even though both receive design review from [ORGANIZATION]. Therefore, I'm requesting an amendment in the mixed-use zones chapter that will allow the 10-foot bonus height in historic districts if there is no contributing building on the site."
11_30_2017,affordable housing,"We need to look at all of our equity goals. And we need to make sure that there are effective, for example, transit connections between where people of lower income are living and where they need to go for their housing, I mean, for their jobs. And we need to provide sufficient affordable housing close to job centers."
11_30_2017,affordable housing,That's why we've had 350 people contact you and sign our letter and to bring this issue [ORGANIZATION] to rain on the parade of what otherwise is a really awesome initiative moving forward with congestion pricing. Lord knows we have other infrastructural needs like affordable housing that we should be thinking about how we allocate money towards. Being here and patting ourselves on the back that we're supporting congestion pricing but still allowing this freeway expansion to happen is like patting ourselves on the back that we passed an energy consumption initiative while also voting for a $450 million coal plant.
11_14_2018,homelessness,"You know, maybe it'd be a good idea to expand their mission to include humans. I would think they would do a little bit better job with homelessness. Well, congratulations."
11_14_2018,housing crisis,"It's not true. Well, you may be a good landlord, but we have thousands of landlords taking advantage of a housing crisis  raising rents. Okay, [ORGANIZATION], I hear what you're saying."
11_14_2018,homelessness,"Now you doesn't sound like you were one of those landlords and I'm sorry that it negatively impacted you, but we had to take action to protect hundreds of thousands of renters who are at risk of Displacement and homelessness and that's all I want to say. I'm sorry."
11_14_2018,homeless,"Consent agenda is adopted. First time certain item [DATE].  authorize the purchase of certain real property known as [ORGANIZATION], located at [ADDRESS], for purchase price and closing cost in an amount not to exceed $3,052,056. Colleagues, we regularly hear during communications  that we are either not addressing the homeless crisis or we are not sufficiently addressing the homeless crisis."
11_14_2018,homelessness,"Thank you. Currently, [ORGANIZATION] provides 70 low-cost, low-barrier, single-room occupancy units. This acquisition will preserve a scarce type of housing that's vital to our efforts to tackling homelessness in the central city for our most vulnerable neighbors and moves us closer towards our goal of 2,000 units in [ORGANIZATION] with regard to supportive housing."
11_14_2018,homeless,"Future plans to replace the existing building will create new units that are safe, high quality, and permanently affordable homes with services for very low-income individuals, including permanent supportive housing units. And so with that, I'll turn it over to our presenters' panel. We have [ORGANIZATION], of course, from [ORGANIZATION], PERSON1 from [ORGANIZATION]."
11_14_2018,homeless,"Thank you, Mayor, Commissioners, [ORGANIZATION], the Director of [ORGANIZATION]. And I just want to take [TIME] to celebrate the partnership that this project represents amongst all of us who you'll hear from [ORGANIZATION], but in particular the city and the county. At the time that [PERSON] was sold [LOCATION], the county commissioned in a resolution brought forward by Commissioner [PERSON], directed an exploration of the best uses of the proceeds from that sale."
11_14_2018,homeless,"Thank you. There was quickly agreement that the most critical need was to expand permanent supportive housing. We reached out to [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], asking where there might be an opportunity to co-invest the funds in a project with the city that would add supportive housing capacity, in particular for people who are chronically homeless and struggling with serious mental and physical health challenges."
11_14_2018,homeless,"And given that some people are so vulnerable and isolated that they won't seek out services themselves, we have a whole team of outreach workers who are in the community conducting supportive housing assessments on the streets and in people's camps. Right now, we have about 1,300 chronically homeless people who have been assessed through coordinated access and are waiting to be matched for an appropriate supportive housing unit. FAC0 will be a critical addition to the inventory of units available to these extremely vulnerable people in our community, many of whom are living unsheltered."
11_14_2018,homelessness,"Lastly, I also want to talk a little bit about [ORGANIZATION] experience operating and managing low barrier housing for very low income individuals. [ORGANIZATION], I think [ORGANIZATION], there was a study in [PERSON] that came out that talked about the correlation between the loss of [ORGANIZATION] housing to the rise of homelessness in that city. And I think since [LOCATION]...  about 14,000 units of [ORGANIZATION] housing, they started losing about 75% of their 14,000 [ORGANIZATION] units."
11_14_2018,homelessness,"And concurrently, they saw a rise in homelessness. I think the city's acquisition of the [ORGANIZATION] is a great step forward to reversing trends like that in our city. [TIME], I was just there and just seeing kind of how neglected the property is."
11_14_2018,affordable housing,"There was  following the kind of plaster and I think a lot of people, there were hoarding activities and very filthy conditions. And so the city's acquisition of [ORGANIZATION] is really critical in not only reversing the role of providing more affordable housing, but really kind of helping those who have been most marginalized to get connected to services. In terms of assets, as you know, [PERSON], the three arms, four arms of our organization is health services, behavioral health, employment services, and housing, supportive housing services."
11_14_2018,homeless,"And that was a line of argument used at editorial board meetings and some public meetings Well, clearly the public rejected that scare, that fear-mongering that happened during the campaign. But I think it is fair to ask you, from your position, what's the most persistent myth that we have to sort of address about why it is nationally it's become a best practice to provide a deeply affordable rental apartment with services to help chronically homeless people get back on their feet?"
11_14_2018,homeless,I don't know. I don't know. I really don't know certainly one of the myths around the homeless is that the homeless want to be on the streets that they don't want to be in housing
11_14_2018,homelessness,"and I guess that's a myth about homelessness that I see as being perpetuated yes And I can also kind of speak to that. I think [ORGANIZATION]'s approach is to provide comprehensive services, employment, housing, supportive housing, and mental health and primary care."
11_14_2018,homelessness,"And I think what we've seen is, you know, people who come through our housing, they are desperately want to –  want to have safety and security, employment. And within our organization, what I see my staff is, who have kind of come through the ladder from homelessness to voluntary through our community volunteer corps to getting employment,  What I see is some of our best employees are actually people who have come from homelessness through recovery. So I think the myth that by providing more housing and intensive services is going to create more ghettos, I simply don't see that."
11_14_2018,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] is proud to partner with the city to help acquire, build, and asset manage housing funded by [ORGANIZATION]'s affordable housing bond. We enthusiastically endorse the acquisition and redevelopment of [ORGANIZATION]. In connection with the passing of the housing bond, [ORGANIZATION] utilized the flexibility of our special moving to work designation to ensure we could commit to pairing up to 400 project-based vouchers with bond funds."
11_14_2018,homelessness,"And because of the vouchers, the property will serve people living with very low incomes and help people transition from homelessness. Beyond the voucher commitment, [ORGANIZATION] will provide asset management services for the property. We have [DATE] of experience in asset management and managing properties like [ORGANIZATION]."
11_14_2018,homelessness,"It's not fun to be the bearer of bad tidings to have to... So, just to be clear, this project...  does nothing to address homelessness. It's a [STREET] that has 50 people living in it now, and when you're done, it'll have 50 people living in it."
11_14_2018,homelessness,"So it's a zero net on homelessness. It is changing the status of those units from slumlord-operated $500 per month paid by people who only have $700 a month of income to...  those people will now be paying 30% of their income and will live in a clean, hygienic building. But it's actually zero gain in the struggle to end homelessness, period."
11_14_2018,homeless,"And I'm a former [ORGANIZATION] champion and a former homeless. Well, actually, I'm still homeless. I live in a [STREET] that is called housing."
11_14_2018,homeless,"You know, a lot of people don't even go into the shower. And then I'm supposed to bring folks over to, you know, homeless folks to try to help them bring them in off the [STREET], right? And then I got to...  be embarrassed to show them what kind of shower that we have to live in."
11_14_2018,homelessness,It's wrong. [PERSON] is going to increase. You think the president is going to do anything to help homelessness?
11_14_2018,homelessness,"What politician have you heard anything talk about homelessness at all? In fact, in [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION], none. That's the problem."
11_14_2018,homelessness,"It is our most effective tool in addressing chronic homelessness. I am pleased that we continue to make progress, and this is difficult because this is deeply affordable, subsidized housing with services, and we haven't figured out all of the ins and outs of how we're going to cover the costs of the services, but we're making steady progress. And I'm also pleased that we are acquiring this particular building, and in time we'll make sure that it's a community resource for [ORGANIZATION]."
11_14_2018,homelessness,"and I've got my family back and I've, more importantly than anything else, I've got my sense of dignity and my sense of pride back. These kinds of projects are what it is going to take for this community to be able to make progress against the scourge of homelessness."
11_14_2018,homeless,That's okay. But this is what you asked me to do. This is the kind of leadership I told you that I would provide as your leader to address the homeless situation in our community.
11_14_2018,affordable housing,It helps us promote improvements within our own bureau and within the larger housing system. I am honored that each of the appointees [ORGANIZATION] are willing to devote their time and expertise to advise us. They are each respected experts in their field and represent different facets of the work involving affordable housing.
11_14_2018,affordable housing,"I'm joined [ORGANIZATION] by [ORGANIZATION] who is the Director of [ORGANIZATION] and Housing Policy at [ORGANIZATION]. She brings to us best practice expertise in successfully managing and operating buildings with appropriate services. And also joining me [ORGANIZATION] is [ORGANIZATION], the Executive Director of [ORGANIZATION], a committed nonprofit developer, owner, and operator of more than 1,300 units of affordable housing with an emphasis on wraparound services."
11_14_2018,homeless,"Welcome. Thank you. So I'm [PERSON], and I began working with homeless men and women in [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION]."
11_14_2018,affordable housing,"For [ORGANIZATION], I've dedicated my professional life to creating safe, accessible, and affordable housing for low-income people. I've done this in [ORGANIZATION], in [PERSON], and in [ORGANIZATION], where I was born and raised. I feel very strongly that home is the foundation upon which we build our lives and that everyone deserves a safe [STREET] to live."
11_14_2018,housing crisis; affordable housing,"I would be honored to join [ORGANIZATION] to contribute my passion and my expertise to this city that I love as we work together to find a path out of our housing crisis. If [ORGANIZATION] has taught me anything, it is that affordable housing is not easy or fast. But I do know that you all share my commitment to this work and that we can do better."
11_14_2018,affordable housing,"As [ORGANIZATION] said, I'm [PERSON]. I'm the Director of [ORGANIZATION] and Housing Policy at [ORGANIZATION], the housing authority serving [ORGANIZATION]. I've been working in affordable housing development, implementation, and policymaking in [PERSON] for [ORGANIZATION], and prior to that in GPE2 and [PERSON]."
11_14_2018,homelessness; affordable housing,"Thank you. Over this time, I've had the honor to work on ending homelessness initiatives, permanent supportive housing policy and implementation, asset management, capacity building, fair housing, streamlining compliance, turnaround strategies for affordable housing assets, and long-term housing sustainability. I am currently the co-chair of ORG0 ORG1,  [ORGANIZATION] and member of [ORGANIZATION]."
11_14_2018,homelessness; affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], and PERSON2 are big-time community leaders around affordable housing and addressing homelessness. And I have one special request. So Mayor [PERSON] and I worked on creating [ORGANIZATION], and when we created [ORGANIZATION], I worked with Director [PERSON]  to create the ORG1, ORG2."
12_11_2019,homeless,My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I am a homeowner homeowner on FAC0 and FAC1 I am here [ORGANIZATION] to talk about the livability and safety issues We have in connection with [ORGANIZATION] and the lack of sidewalks and streetlights on our [STREET] I have passed out a map showing the location we are talking about and the pictures highlighting issues with homeless campsites these pictures were taken over [LOCATION] span and sometimes these sites took over DATE2 to clear and  We have [TIME] parking signs that are not enforced regularly. The problem has been chronic on this [STREET].
12_11_2019,homeless,"We have requested sidewalks and streetlights to be put in for [ORGANIZATION] now. They will deter homeless camping, and with the influx of crime and drugs on our [STREET], we also are asking for streetlights to be put in so this area is not so ideal for drug use and sales. We recommend that [ORGANIZATION] secure their parking lot after [TIME] for the safety of our neighbors."
12_11_2019,houseless,"Hi, I'm [PERSON], and I rent a house about five blocks away from FAC0, and I represent myself in the interest of the homeowner. There's been an uptick in property damage, theft, and waste over [ORGANIZATION], and the cause is...  drug use and drug epidemic in general. And we know that's a problem the country faces, and [ORGANIZATION] in particular with the number of houseless, which we have an immense amount of compassion for."
12_11_2019,homeless,Thank you. So obviously the number one issue facing this city is the homeless crisis. And it's not just [ORGANIZATION].
12_11_2019,homeless,"No pun intended. My piece of this, I will raise these issues with [ORGANIZATION] directly and through the [ORGANIZATION] Office of Homeless Services, and we'll have that conversation. But I appreciate your being here [ORGANIZATION] and expressing your concerns directly."
12_11_2019,homeless,"So it is legitimately a thoroughfare. We have [ORGANIZATION] right there and I think that we are unique in that [STREET] that we have a [ORGANIZATION], you know, a homeless services [STREET]  right next to our actual homes."
12_11_2019,homeless,"Next individual, [ORGANIZATION], on a slightly different subject, I believe. Item [DATE], request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel regarding, yes, [ORGANIZATION], the homeless cure. Good morning."
12_11_2019,homeless,"Today I would like to present a summary of my previous four visits to this council. On [ORGANIZATION], I covered homeless issues and the need for 400 acres to create a rehabilitation community, village, and farmland. The message was how we plan to graduate 500 job-ready individuals [LOCATION] through mentoring interaction along with job and personal community skills."
12_11_2019,homeless,"To begin, we could use a portion of the city-owned golf courses or set aside 10 acres of the proposed FAC0 and allow YES to build a 50-acre apartment to house 100 rehabilitated, job-ready employees to build and maintain this treatment plant. and all of the above are people that we are gathering off the [STREET] and offering them a better [STREET] to live with advancement opportunities like education, clean food and water. On [ORGANIZATION], besides all the crying that went on in here on [ORGANIZATION], I covered homeless and foster children."
12_11_2019,homelessness,"On [ORGANIZATION], I covered mental health and suicide and the demanding need for better care and equipped to help bring meaning and peace to [LOCATION]. DATE2, undereducated students that go on to be more prone to homelessness, low-paying jobs, and addiction. The YES Campus will follow these kids through a successful graduation with job-ready skills."
12_11_2019,homeless,"The reason for the YES Plan is to add a much-needed feature that no other plan before has offered –  Safe, caring, education, on-the-job training, self-esteem building, purpose, and successful interaction. With these skills, their chance of becoming homeless is less than 20%. The present situation, we will see more than 80% back on the [STREET]."
12_11_2019,homeless,"Yes, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] is a middleman between all agencies that deal with systems that are presently not sufficiently communicating. First, the evaluation center, a chosen panel of experts, will conduct an intensive evaluation of each individual and choose their destination. This eval center will take over the present shelter locations and be used for temporary housing until the evaluations are complete."
12_11_2019,affordable housing,"an opportunity we have in [ORGANIZATION] to do something really big and to get it right. And when I say get it right, I mean the inclusiveness, I mean the actual density that needs to be in that particular area to kind of deal with what we need in affordable housing. And it just reminds me of when you try to be excited about something that's really hard to be excited about."
12_11_2019,housing crisis,"Yes, it's an extra expense, but it creates so much more livable of a neighborhood. And I think another thing that's very different now is there is a housing crisis. There is a climate crisis."
12_11_2019,affordable housing,"These are envisioned to be primarily ownership, but they could be a variety, and we've had some discussions with even affordable housing providers that might be interested in a component of this. And this is a rendering of what that might look like as it interfaces the existing FAC0, although I would mention that the edge of the park here currently was not designed  with anticipation of housing development on that side. So there might be some opportunity for future work with parks to kind of rethink how that park interfaces."
12_11_2019,affordable housing,"Well, this site is full of such exciting potential for density, for affordable housing. I'm also a big fan of the repurposed barn. Please don't tear that barn down."
12_11_2019,homeless,"Mr. [PERSON] first began his work at [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION], managing an innovative homeless housing program known as [ORGANIZATION]. It had a major employment component. And during that time, as a total of Mr. [PERSON]'s service with [ORGANIZATION], a total of [LOCATION], he's had several different jobs."
12_11_2019,homeless,"Some of the certificates that he has gotten, with the certificate in moral recognition therapy and basic training, he added MRT, which is an advanced training, freedom [STREET] cognitive training, brain-based mentoring certification, habilitation empowerment accountability certification,  certification. He's also a certified [ORGANIZATION] volunteer as well. In [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] entered a partnership with ORG2 to develop an effort to assist homeless people to stabilize their lives and train for and keep living wage jobs."
12_11_2019,homeless,"I'm really happy to be here. I haven't been at this desk for quite a while, and so it's good to be back in front of [ORGANIZATION], and particularly for [ORGANIZATION], because...  Of the many employees at [ORGANIZATION], I've known him for a long time and worked directly with him and have some clear idea of the kinds of things and the impact he's had on the homeless people and people who are in recovery and people who are coming out of the prisons and the criminal justice system. So..."
12_11_2019,homeless,"So we were talking about, I was talking with him about the,  the intensive building trades training program that was a grant from the city. And it was intended to help homeless people regain real employment, living wages, and to change the direction of their lives. And it was targeted to people who were been in addiction and now are in recovery and now we're working on getting good jobs."
12_11_2019,affordable housing,"Could you please read our one and only quick item [TIME], item number [DATE]. amend the comprehensive plan comprehensive plan map zoning map title through the 33 planning and zoning Title 18 noise control title 30 affordable housing title 32 signs and related regulations to revise the multi-dwelling [ORGANIZATION] designations and base zones very good. Well, we're back to continue our work on the better housing by design recommended draft  To help reorient everyone to the proposals, the intent of [ORGANIZATION] amendments is to expand housing options, address affordability, and improve design in [ORGANIZATION]'s multi-dwelling zones."
12_11_2019,affordable housing,"They've changed from being the recommended draft to being as amended by city council drafts. You don't have to read all this. And we also have for the record, the maps that reflect the map amendments you made and a new Title 30 affordable housing section  What we are coming to you for are to amend other documents that are part of [ORGANIZATION] package to be consistent with the decisions you made."
11_25_2015,houseless,"There are the rules and our structures, but we as human beings have to take courage and treat each other and deal with our relationships to each other and our planet. Thank you. And our houseless folks are our neighbors, and everybody knows that."
11_25_2015,houseless,"Thank you. Okay, [DATE], please. [DATE], request of [ORGANIZATION] to address [ORGANIZATION] regarding houseless issues."
11_25_2015,houseless,I'm here to talk about some issues like needing more showers and laundry facilities for the houseless. You know there's tons of soap that I've received  but no water or [STREET] to bathe. Public bathhouses or bathtubs wouldn't be a bad idea.
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"as mixed-use buildings, and fewer abandoned houses, though that's another issue that we need to take on. But I'm, like a lot of people in [ORGANIZATION], less happy with what's happening to our existing housing stock in neighborhoods and the demolition of great old houses being replaced by much larger, more expensive houses is a problem not just for one house at a time but for the very character of our neighborhoods. the average difference between a house that was purchased and demolished and the house that replaced it is nearly $300,000 so this is not the provision of new affordable housing by any stretch"
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"Okay, in the paragraph above. Okay, so now that section would read, Subsequent housing development following demolition that qualifies as affordable housing is determined—  by [ORGANIZATION] applying the criteria established in [DATE] may apply for and obtain rebates of up to $25,000, subject to guidelines developed by [ORGANIZATION]. So that's the affordable housing rebate that remains, but the rebate for tearing down one house and building two would go away if we approve this amendment."
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"Got that right. So I guess I'm now confused. No, this is just the affordable housing one."
11_25_2015,affordable housing,Is it [PERSON] who's going to develop the guidelines or ORG1? The amendment...  Mayor that Commissioner [PERSON] is calling Mayor 1 doesn't touch that first paragraph. I think Commissioner [PERSON] is suggesting we treat that as a third or as a separate amendment to amend the language regarding a rebate for affordable housing.
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"Okay. Now, Commissioner [PERSON], I think you wanted to also amend the – you talked about another amendment. I think there may be up to three competing amendments on the affordable housing exemptions."
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"Family member, the developer. I mean, someone does a proxy purchase to get the rebate, and then [ORGANIZATION] determines that the house wants to put the market on the house, so sells it at below market value.  to a proxy person to get the rebate and then puts it on at whatever the full market is? Well, my understanding is that for the existing [ORGANIZATION] affordable housing ORG1 waiver, that I made my staff ask [PERSON] whether there's any guard against that sort of insider dealing for the ORG1 waiver."
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"Okay, [ORGANIZATION], are you ready? Yeah. So my amendment is I think we're all operating in the same spirit here, and that is an exemption for...  uh affordable housing and what i'm proposing is we simply follow the the guidelines the housing bureau already sets for the home ownership limited tax exemption program where we determine [ORGANIZATION] or the [ORGANIZATION] determines [ORGANIZATION] a price a sales cap price in order to qualify that a home must sell for or less in order to qualify for stc waivers and property tax exemption for the purchaser and so it simply ties  the rebate to that sales price cap that ORG1 sets [LOCATION]."
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"I mean, the point you make about a waiver versus a rebate is a good point. I think it applies to everything we're talking about here, though. We've had some folks in the affordable housing community just argue that a waiver is cleaner, and they have a track, particularly when it's a [ORGANIZATION] or [PERSON] or someone that we know has a track record of  doing this kind of housing, but if you do it as a rebate, they have to finance the cost up front and then apply for the rebate."
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"I think that is possible, and I think that's something that could be worked out with administrative rules. PERSON0 on Commissioner [PERSON]'s staff indicated one of her objectives in referencing the [ORGANIZATION] program is that it is a program that  affordable housing developers apply for prior to actually developing and starting construction. So we would have those commitments in [STREET] quite early in the development process, and it would at least, I think, give us the opportunity to shorten a period of  where the $25,000 might have to be carried."
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"And I'd like to find a mechanism that treats it as a lien or some other [STREET], suspends an actual cash payment where we have that affordable housing commitment. So it's your preference. We haven't seen Commissioner [PERSON]'s amendments."
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"The most affordable home is the one that is already standing. And once these homes are demolished, they are gone forever, taken out of service forevermore. By charging developers $25,000 for each home they demolish for the  purpose of helping fund affordable housing efforts, this at least creates a revenue source to help families stay in [ORGANIZATION] who are otherwise being priced out from both rental housing and homeownership, and addresses the cost of the loss of affordable housing to our rapidly changing community."
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"The [ORGANIZATION] editorial also cites aesthetic objections of neighbors as a primary justification for this tax. While the building of a house that is three times the size of the house demolished certainly runs counter to the comprehensive plan stated objective of preserving neighborhood character, the primary target of this disincentive tax is not the size of the replacement houses,  but to preserve the existing houses. And where the tax is not successful in deterring demolition, the tax revenue will be used to help fund affordable housing programs, which is only fair since every demolition is, in effect, a cost to the neighborhood in terms of livability and health."
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"In conclusion, this is more than just a vote to impose a tax. It's an opportunity to send the message that,  that willy-nilly demolitions in our neighborhoods for the purpose of building million-dollar replacement homes with little or no regard to existing residences or the need for affordable housing is not what [ORGANIZATION] is all about. Thank you."
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"I live in northeast [ORGANIZATION], and I work with [ORGANIZATION], or [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION], whose work is endorsed by 43 neighborhood associations, supports the demolition tax as a [STREET] to maintain and fund viable, affordable housing while also better distributing the costs of trash and build development. The loss of housing is real, exacerbated by developers now eliminating homes to merely put the lots on the market, this during a declared housing emergency."
11_25_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"I'm here [ORGANIZATION] representing [ORGANIZATION], which is an organization of 115 area organizations working to increase dedicated funding in the [ORGANIZATION] [LOCATION] region to build, preserve, and support affordable housing. And we're here to strongly support the proposed demolition tax. Obviously, this new tax alone cannot fix our affordable housing crisis, but it is one more tool in our toolbox of revenue and policy solutions toward an equitable [ORGANIZATION] where everyone can find a [STREET] to call home."
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"If I may comment in regard to some of the many amendments that are on the table, obviously we strongly support the exemption for nonprofit housing. I really appreciate that being put forward, and we're sure that our city staff can capably work through the complexities of figuring out how to make that work, but we really appreciate the intent to not add to the already high costs of providing affordable housing. We need to reduce those costs wherever possible in that burden."
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"And we also would love it if the currently existing loophole for partial demolition, where you tear down almost, but not entirely, the whole building, if there's a [STREET] to close that loophole, that would be an even better policy. So on the whole, we're very happy to support this new policy and really appreciate your leadership to seek new and dedicated revenue streams to permanently close the gap on our affordable housing shortfall. It's a great first step for [ORGANIZATION] and a good step forward for housing equity in [ORGANIZATION]."
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"Houses are being demolished. And a lot of us have a lot of concerns about the direction of the city, and I think that the demolition tax would really address a lot of these issues. My two biggest concerns are that we have an extreme lack of affordable housing and that we're allowing too many of our historic structures to be torn down."
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"So, I think that we really do need stricter controls for demolishing houses. We need affordable housing. Rents are going crazy."
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"And if we don't do something, then quickly, people are not going to be able to afford to live in the city that they've lived in. So, affordable housing definitely needs attention. And this, to me, seems like a very neat, tidy [STREET] to address these two issues."
11_25_2015,affordable housing,I'm a home builder. I've spent my whole career since DATE0 building primarily affordable housing. It's what I do.
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"Of course, to affordable housing is the main priority. Another concern I have is people selling the houses in the neighborhoods. Why don't the neighborhood associations get together with them and say, why don't you put something in a covenant or something in an agreement that states you don't want this to be demolished and only will sell it to somebody that wants to rehab the property?"
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"I'll try to be even [TIME] because I think I'm here to suggest that you're going in the right direction with this tax. It really could be, as [ORGANIZATION] said from [ORGANIZATION] on, I join her voice in... This effort to create yet another source, another tool in our extraordinary effort to deal with this crisis we have here in our wonderful city around affordable housing."
11_25_2015,affordable housing,I appreciate Commissioner [PERSON]'s effort to expand our choices. Thank you. We do need to talk about establishing permanently affordable housing.
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"We think the money raised from the demolition tax will not of itself solve our affordability housing issues, but even if only half of the current 400 homes that are demolished end up paying that tax, that is $5 million towards this very important goal of affordable housing. And, of course, we hope some of that affordable housing will be created in historic buildings. Thank you."
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I represent [ORGANIZATION], which is a collaborative effort of four community development organizations in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood, [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, and [PERSON]. Our first major concern, which we relayed to you in written communication you've already taken care of, which was to add an exemption, an upfront exemption for demolitions that will result in affordable housing."
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"So it's a wonderful exception, but it's an exception. And so I guess it goes to the point, though, because we have – and I have my share of qualms with this proposal. I'm not trying to mislead you here, but –  It does seem that we use a very elastic definition of what's affordable housing sometimes in these debates."
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"And I guess I'll put it to you as I'm interested just from a policy point of view. Does imposing an additional $25,000 on a transaction where the house is going to be sold for between $700,000 and $1 million, does that work against any definition of affordable housing goals in our city? Okay."
11_25_2015,affordable housing,You may disagree with the policy. You may disagree with the tool. But is there any conceivable affordable housing goal of the city that that offends?
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"But our hands are tied because they have more influence in [ORGANIZATION] than we do. So on this one, does it offend an affordable housing goal to add $25,000 if it truly is a pass-through to someone buying a house between $700,000 and $1 million? Well, you know, I would suggest, Commissioner [PERSON], that the issue can be looked at in two lenses."
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"You're talking about housing affordability and affordable housing. And so if it's an affordable housing goal and does $25,000 offend the notion, I apologize, I'm not quite understanding. One of your members –  who's thinking about tearing down a house and building a bigger house, has to add $25,000, decides to add $25,000, see if they can collect an additional $25,000, in other words, pass this cost through."
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"And in my neighborhood, by the [STREET], people are strategically listing prices at a ridiculous number, and then there's a bidding war that goes above that. So we're in an uncharted territory in terms of what people are willing to pay, apparently, at this high end. Does it offend any affordable housing goals that I know the [ORGANIZATION] cares about and we work on?"
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"take that density piece out, and that's clear. Well, at some point, because the home builders have worked with us on lots of affordable housing initiatives, your foundation does amazing work, I'd be interested in continuing this discussion around things we can support together. And I appreciate that this is a tool that you don't support."
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"And I'd be interested in what tools we could support. And again, most of them seem to be preempted.  by the state legislature. And I'd love to find something that you and I could together go to [ORGANIZATION] and agree as a tool that we should use for affordable housing."
11_25_2015,homeless,"So I know [ORGANIZATION] will, in the right context, question the market, even if it's just real estate, because the real estate market is seen in [ORGANIZATION], and it's seen when you walk down FAC0. FAC0 in [ORGANIZATION],  and now FAC0, FAC1, and [PERSON] look the same. They're full of buildings that have homeless people sleeping in front of them."
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"That's a small part of the affordable housing thing. I know we have some things coming online, hopefully [TIME] and [ORGANIZATION] night, to start addressing that problem. But I'm not sure how much honesty and candor has been in some of this testimony."
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"May we could start with having [ORGANIZATION] address Commissioner [PERSON] Desire for the view of the planning girls [ORGANIZATION] ORG2 Bureau planning and sustainability I think What you face is a balancing of two values the density  exemption within the single-family zones and the added lots that we get from that are actually a Small part of our future growth that we're planning on it's probably less than 10% of the 120,000 new units in [ORGANIZATION] and you offset that with the affordable housing fund revenue that you're generating and so in terms of how we meet our future growth projections and  You know, I think that ORG1 can go a long [STREET] towards helping us meet and create that affordable housing that offsets anything that we would lose because of the deterrent of a few infill lot splits. This might be a question better addressed to your co-ORG2, but I'm curious about the carbon emission impact."
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"Following the issuance of the demolition permit, the owner may apply for and obtain a temporary abeyance of the demolition tax assessment on the basis of subsequent development of affordable housing at the property. [ORGANIZATION] shall adopt administrative rules for qualifying, in this first instance of the word exempt, I would strike from this amendment. Okay."
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"So it would read, [ORGANIZATION] shall adopt administrative rules for qualifying affordable housing as exempt from demolition tax using criteria under either  Section 30.01.095 or [ORGANIZATION], because I understand there were two proposals here. So that's a choice we have to make. A choice the council needs to make, correct."
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"And then continuing, if the subsequent housing development qualifies as affordable housing under [ORGANIZATION] administrative rules, the director, that would be the revenue director, shall determine that the demolition tax  But no demolition tax is due. So this is, in effect, a rewritten version of Commissioner [PERSON]'s. Exactly."
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"And then there's another final piece of this is that subsequent housing development does not qualify as affordable housing. The director shall determine that the demolition tax assessment is due and payable. PERSON0, the virtue of Commissioner [PERSON]'s amendment was it's very straightforward and clear."
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"Yeah, because they're going to do administrative rules, which we'll look at to review. Oh. So then the modified language would be [ORGANIZATION] shall adopt administrative rules for qualifying affordable housing as exempt from the demolition excise tax, period."
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"but i think we need to read into the record numbers one and two because i don't know that [ORGANIZATION] did that already right so numbers one and two below b that we just modified says if the subsequent housing development qualifies as affordable housing under  [ORGANIZATION] administrative rules, the director shall determine that no demolition tax is due. And two, if the subsequent housing development does not qualify as affordable housing, the director shall determine that the demolition tax assessment is due and payable."
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"Sorry. PERSON0. This really gets at the crux of, is this proposal for reducing demolitions, or is it for providing money for affordable housing?"
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"What's the primary purpose of it? I think the most persuasive purpose is that it's for providing money for affordable housing. $375,000 is not affordable to a lot of Portlanders."
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"For the median family income, $375,000 is not affordable. So the thought of giving a 50% rebate to properties that sell for 150% of median income  or medium sales price just doesn't meet my definition of what's affordable housing. And so I would like to have something like this."
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"Now, if the council wants to respond to the testimony we heard that it ought to be assessing a tax for every residential unit, that would capture duplexes, nonconforming multifamily development, single-family homes where there's an interior accessory dwelling unit,  you know we would write it that [STREET] but as staff really understands it now a duplex would only require one permit and only one $25,000 tax would be applied  Or a clarification. I think if the goal is to reduce demolitions and to get more money for affordable housing, both, we want to make it apply to as much as possible. So to my mind, yes, you would charge $50,000 for a duplex being demolished."
11_25_2015,homeless,"This includes home ownership, home repair, fair housing programs, and homeless service programs. this is also being used by both the county and the city and it's increasingly being accepted and used in [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]"
11_25_2015,homelessness,"Aye. Okay, [ORGANIZATION], amend subrecipient contract with [ORGANIZATION], to add $924,[ADDRESS] engagement program for people experiencing homelessness."
11_25_2015,homelessness,"PERSON0? Yes, thank you for this work, and thank you to the Mayor and Commissioner [PERSON] for putting this contract together. I know [PERSON] was here earlier, and he wanted to make the point that not everybody who's experiencing homelessness or houselessness is somebody who's also experiencing mental illnesses, right?"
09_23_2015,homelessness,"Good morning, everyone, and welcome. We'll get to the council's regular calendar in a moment. I just wanted to make an announcement of something that's going to be coming to council because of the rising concern highlighted once again on the cover of [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] about housing affordability in the city and about homelessness."
09_23_2015,homeless; homelessness,"The county chair and I have been working together in a wonderful partnership with [ORGANIZATION] to address the issue of veterans' homelessness. We started with about 690 homeless veterans in our city, and we're down to about 230. So by a concerted effort on something of an emergency basis, we've proved that we can actually move the needle."
09_23_2015,homelessness,"So I believe that the [ORGANIZATION] cities that are dealing with housing affordability problems, with rising rents, and with intractable homelessness need to work together, and that's why I've invited those mayors along with the other [ORGANIZATION] mayors to a [ORGANIZATION] Mayors Conference here in [ORGANIZATION], and we'll continue our discussions together of those issues. But in the meantime, I think it's time for [ORGANIZATION] to act  and I believe [PERSON] is when we'll bring the ordinance forward for community discussion and for council action. So because that's going to be an important item for the council and an important item for the community, I just wanted to announce that it's coming."
09_23_2015,homeless; affordable housing,"yes my name is [ORGANIZATION] i represent [ORGANIZATION] watchdog [PERSON] as you know in the past i  I've done speeches on the different foundations, and of course I support the foundations and hope they do very well. One of the issues I have on this whole situation here, again, is that when we're talking authorized to use the payroll deduction system, is that, as Mayor [PERSON] stated [ORGANIZATION], is that we are in a state of emergency pertaining to the homeless, to affordable housing issues. And until we start putting that at the top of the list, and as Commissioner PERSON3 has created the housing fund, which I don't see on this list, and number one, I'd like to know if payroll deductions can go toward the housing fund, which I thought was originally set up to do."
09_23_2015,homeless,"I'd also like to have this at the top of the list due to that's a state of emergency. I'd like all the employees of the city of [ORGANIZATION] to understand that. that when you have homeless people scattered around on the sidewalks and the doorways, that is also your responsibility to make sure that there is a solution for that."
09_23_2015,homeless; affordable housing,"that when we are in a state of emergency and other foundations can look to other areas to obtain their funding, the city and [ORGANIZATION]'s employees' first responsibility should be the homeless, should be to affordable housing. And that is my position. Thank you for your time."
09_23_2015,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]'s not here to respond, so I'll do so on his behalf. The fund you're referring to is [ORGANIZATION]. and it is an entity into which [PERSON] has proposed putting general fund and other resources to build and preserve affordable housing."
09_23_2015,homeless,"the [ORGANIZATION] twice at FAC0 where there were officers, both fare inspectors and police officers, rushing onto the train, obviously targeting folks who may appear to be young or homeless. Frankly, it was a very frightening experience. I don't think that's a good...  [STREET] for us to get trust in our police officers when that's happening on our public transportation?"
09_23_2015,homeless,"The people understand the city want more oversight and regulation, and we can agree on a city fee for a business permit, but it should not include more stringent guidelines that already are outlined by state laws. I also urge you to review these fees so that they are fair to business owners rather than the noted fees listed at greater than 10% higher or [ADDRESS] state laws i again note that conflict will rise when already licensed state businesses and invested business owners  potentially fail to receive a new city permit under this more stringent guideline outlined in this ordinance."
11_01_2017,affordable housing,"direct [ORGANIZATION] to formally adopt asset management policies and guidelines to help borrowers and sponsors with roles and responsibilities as recipients of funding. Colleagues, over [ORGANIZATION], the city has invested in excess of $300 million into affordable housing. That investment has resulted in over 13,000 units of affordable housing."
11_01_2017,affordable housing,"And it really is to outline the expectations and responsibilities of the borrowers and the sponsors as it relates to the [ORGANIZATION] funding that we provide for affordable housing. We conduct it to be sure that the property is performing as projected, that we are actually serving. It's benefiting the intended populations that we're providing the funds for so that the property itself can achieve long-term sustainability."
11_01_2017,homelessness,"Okay. So it's people being squeezed in this market, but it's unlikely that these are people also we're seeing on the sidewalks. And so my question to you, Director [PERSON], is given the council's renewed focus on meeting [STREET] homelessness and permanent supportive housing units, are we going to be changing the pipeline prospectively so that we are –  capturing the units we're going to need to meet our commitment to permanent supportive housing goals?"
11_01_2017,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] is not tracking the services, but we will be doing a deep dive with [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION] to get to a sustainable package. And as you know, within the bond framework plan that you adopted as a council, there are some 2,000 – excuse me, 300 units of 0 to 30 units set aside for supportive housing. That will make a difference."
11_01_2017,affordable housing,"So one of the things that's been mentioned by other people testifying on affordable housing is that – PERSON0, could you get a little closer just so we can hear you? I'm always afraid I'm getting too close. Is that just right?"
11_01_2017,affordable housing,"Okay. The affordable housing, the people that are sleeping on the sidewalks in tents have zero income. And how are they going to qualify for affordable housing when they have zero income?"
11_01_2017,affordable housing,"They are going to continue to be on the streets. They're going to fall through the cracks until we figure out a [STREET] to reach out and help them. And so this is just one idea that came to my mind, and I'd like to see, you know, [ORGANIZATION] kind of think outside of the box and think how can we –  qualify these people to take advantage of affordable housing."
11_01_2017,affordable housing,"And I also want to say I really appreciate the conversation about the people whose incomes go up and the people who are burdened. In my particular situation, almost 60% of my [ORGANIZATION] goes to my rent in affordable housing. I could move into a smaller unit, but it would be [ORGANIZATION] before one would be available."
11_01_2017,housing crisis,"I think the program's called Benefit. so that once we have someone in the system, we're certainly helping them access [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], food stamps, but it's incredibly challenging in the kind of situation that you mentioned. And I am actually curious, Director [PERSON], you mentioned that there's a federal policy of not evicting people once they...  disqualify income-wise, and I completely support not wanting to displace people during a housing crisis, even if their income is 100% of MFI, because we know they still can't afford market rate rents."
11_01_2017,affordable housing,"But I am concerned that there could be people earning more than 100% of MFI who certainly could qualify, and they are taking up  precious spots in our affordable housing. And perhaps that's something we can't do anything about because of federal law. Well, since that's a question, I'd be happy to respond."
11_01_2017,homeless,"I won't say we cut corners, but I would just say that when you put a lot of talented people together, you fix problems. He ended up getting kind of a golden ticket, which is he got a very nice apartment in a nice building in the neighborhood in which he had been chronically homeless forever. And I wish I could tell you that the story had a happy ending."
11_01_2017,homeless,"Yeah. But because he had been chronically homeless for so long, he really found it impossible to be a successful tenant. And ultimately, he took a trip, did not pay attention to any of the lease obligations, lost his apartment, and was back on the [STREET]."
11_01_2017,homeless,"And with that in mind, we need to really start addressing the manager on site, more specialized training in drug addictions, mental illness, and understanding on how to deal with, like was stated, a  that has been chronic homeless for [ORGANIZATION] and is adapting to living indoors again. And it's the same concept which I've been trying to push, is that in my belief, every person that's chronically homeless should be set up on the plan of receiving a certain amount of income per month at a certain point. And I've talked to you on that, and why that is is that  The trauma suffered over [LOCATION] is that we can't all just have that mindset is that just go out and get a job, everything will be fine."
11_01_2017,affordable housing,"And I understand and agree with concerns about equity. There are reports, I think, that the public can access through the city that show how we're spending. And we are deeply investing in [ORGANIZATION] and parks and roads and affordable housing."
11_01_2017,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] says this about CDBG. The CDBG program works to ensure decent, affordable housing to provide services to the most vulnerable in our communities and to create jobs through the expansion and retention of businesses. CDBG is an important tool for helping local government tackle serious challenges facing the community."
11_01_2017,homeless,I've noticed that...  We're having a serious homeless and housing problem. And I'm glad that we were talking about this very subject just now. It's not just African Americans that are being displaced.
11_23_2016,homeless,"With that, we will start with item number [DATE], which is our first communications item.  [DATE], request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel regarding [ORGANIZATION] project of care packages for the homeless. Welcome back, [PERSON]. It's nice to have you here."
11_23_2016,homeless,"Thank you very much. So...  Last time we saw each other, I informed you that I was going to be doing a care – sorry about that – project, which involved making care packages for the homeless. And let me just say it was a complete success."
11_23_2016,homeless,"Also, it was kind of nice seeing the reaction of homeless people upon learning that they would be receiving a care package. They felt that there was hope and there were some people caring for the homeless out there. Yeah."
11_23_2016,homeless,"Well, and what else have you learned about [ORGANIZATION]'s homeless community? You've obviously met a lot of homeless people in this project. What advice do you have for us as a city council and for us as a city based on what you've learned by all this firsthand relationship?"
11_23_2016,homeless,"Okay. Well, what I'd say is that everybody can contribute in one [STREET], shape, or form, in one [STREET]. If we all work together, we can all help this homeless problem come to an end at last."
11_23_2016,homeless,"Well, not just by making care packages, but by doing something for the homeless community, by having your [STREET] be open for the homeless people during [ORGANIZATION] so that they can have a nice good meal to eat. That's great. Well, you'll be happy to know that we're opening yet another shelter [LOCATION]."
11_23_2016,homeless,"Let's hear from Mr. [PERSON], [DATE]. Item [DATE], request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel regarding criminal activity at homeless camp and law enforcement. Thank you for coming."
11_23_2016,homeless,"Before you sigh and think, oh, another complaint about the homeless, please understand that this is not a homeless issue. There are many homeless living in [ORGANIZATION], living in cars, tents, and sometimes just under a tarp. We as a community feel for these people, have gotten to know many of them by name, and we do what we can for them."
11_23_2016,homelessness,"This is not about them. This is about criminals using the disguise of homelessness to wreak havoc on our neighborhood. We as a community learned that the city of [ORGANIZATION], for all practical purposes, does not distinguish nor recognize that there are two distinct groups of people living on our streets, one that deserves our compassion, our help and support, and one that deserves our vigilance and strict enforcement of our laws."
11_23_2016,homeless,"By not recognizing these two distinct groups, we allow the genuinely homeless to be stereotyped as criminals and also allow them to be victims of crime themselves by the same people. It took over [ORGANIZATION] for our community through constant phone calls to multiple agencies, media outlets, and outreach organizations to remove this criminal enterprise from our streets. It should not be that difficult."
11_23_2016,homeless,"The police responded half a dozen times, the [INSTITUTION] twice for two fires that were burning there, [ORGANIZATION] more, all this money that can be spent elsewhere helping the genuinely homeless. What can be done? I propose that the city recognize that there are two camps of homeless that, when identified, need to be held accountable for their actions through timely enforcement of current laws."
11_23_2016,homeless,"I propose that criminal camps, once identified, be given a single reference number that can be used by the police, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and ORG2, and other city offices involved in these issues to make it easier for communities to more effectively engage the city to deal with their criminal activity. Again, we all understand that there's a homeless problem, and this is not about them. These people need protection from the criminal part of this as well."
11_23_2016,affordable housing,"In your impact statement for the council, it lists public involvement, has a public involvement statement, and it says that you reached out to organizations representing communities of color and tenants, organizations,  organizations representing homeowners with low, moderate, or fixed incomes, and affordable housing advocates and program implementers. I would say, in light of the [ORGANIZATION] testimony, could you just tell us in writing which groups you reached out to that qualify for that, that are covered by those categories? And second, we had one or two people testify that this could alter the underwriting."
11_23_2016,affordable housing,"This is a view looking at the southwest corner of the site from [ORGANIZATION]. To the right is the [ORGANIZATION], and beyond is the [ORGANIZATION], both of which contain affordable housing. So to provide some context on the small site plan, the red indicates the proposed site."
11_23_2016,affordable housing,The yellow indicates the location of the building in the photo. So across the [STREET] to the south is the FAC0. It's a six-story brick affordable housing project built in [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION].
11_23_2016,affordable housing,"One block to the east lies the [ORGANIZATION], a six-story brick and metal panel affordable housing project built for bridge housing in [ORGANIZATION]. One block to the southeast lies the FAC1, a six-story brick multifamily housing project  built in [LOCATION], and diagonally across the intersection will soon be the recently approved seven-story brick and metal clad mixed-use proposal, [ORGANIZATION]. These six to seven-story brick and metal clad buildings create the emerging urban warehouse context that this proposal will reside in."
11_23_2016,affordable housing,"The design and program at the ground level evolved to better activate the [STREET] frontages than the initial schemes. While typical quarter block proposals in the central city typically have greater ground floor activation than this proposal does, the applicant felt that this amount of parking was critical to their particular affordable housing program. Above the ground, the commission still had concerns about the contextual response and the response to the coherency guidelines, especially at the important and prominent corner element, and in particular the oversized rotated aerial windows."
11_23_2016,affordable housing,"We are here to appeal two conditions imposed by [ORGANIZATION] on a 93-unit affordable housing project that you've heard we're developing in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood. I'd like to preface our presentation by recognizing the important role that design commission and design standards play in our city. As a longtime developer in [ORGANIZATION], we know the value that they add to our city's landscape, and we're familiar with the process that is required to obtain design approval."
11_23_2016,affordable housing,"Indeed, we began working with design commission in [ORGANIZATION] in an effort to use the new type 2X design review process that was made available to affordable housing. We incorporated many design changes as a result of the guidance that they gave us at the two different design advice hearings. We were simultaneously working with [ORGANIZATION]."
11_23_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,Okay. [ORGANIZATION] is in the midst of an affordable housing crisis. This project will create 93 units of affordable housing.
11_23_2016,homelessness,[DATE] of those will have project-based rental subsidy and be set aside for families experiencing homelessness. These families need housing now. Redesigning the exterior of the building and its structural plans to accommodate the changes that [ORGANIZATION] has requested will take additional time and money.
11_23_2016,homeless; affordable housing,"This is why we cannot afford any more design changes that increase cost. We've made several of them early on, including increasing the size of the lobby, increasing storefront glass, and adding commercial space. we estimate that the changes we made in response to requests from the design commission planning staff and the neighborhood association resulted in [DATE] of cost to the project they were good changes and we are glad we made them but at this point the project is not able to absorb any more costs related to design redesigning to meet design commission's conditions will add 160 000 in known costs to our budget we just don't have it  What we have is a design that has the support of [ORGANIZATION], honors the site's industrial and cultural history in both its design and materials, demonstrates a diversity of design and creative energy that will speak to our new residents and create a welcoming space for them to call home, strongly relates to its current surroundings without mirroring the design of adjacent affordable housing, and is desperately needed by low-income and homeless families struggling to house their children."
11_23_2016,affordable housing,"I'm principal of [ORGANIZATION], a small [ORGANIZATION]-based [ORGANIZATION]-certified firm specialized in the design of affordable housing. We mostly work with low-income communities of color. Besides practice, I also occasionally teach architectural design at [ORGANIZATION] State University and have previously taught at [ORGANIZATION]."
11_23_2016,affordable housing,"What I love about affordable housing is that residents come from diverse backgrounds. As in my own family, they often have one or two immigrant parents who bring with them a diversity of design sensibilities. In all these communities, there are artistic traditions in architecture, painting, and textiles that use repetitive patterns and bright colors and strong forms."
11_23_2016,affordable housing,"Similarly, what is fascinating about [ORGANIZATION] history is that there's immigrants who settled near the rail yards, not just Europeans, but African Americans, Chinese, and Japanese workers and families. Our two-bay corner design is a nod to this more diverse history of the [PERSON]. We want to use strong forms to create a sense of excitement and inspiration in the urban streetscape as a [STREET] to symbolically connect families of affordable housing to the history of the [PERSON]."
11_23_2016,affordable housing,"And so from our team's point of view, having two bays is the central feature of the design. It responds to the urban context, [DATE] or [TIME], while symbolically connecting folks living in affordable housing to [ORGANIZATION] more diverse history. Thank you."
11_23_2016,affordable housing,"One of the options presents a real increase in cost to an affordable housing development that is struggling to stay on budget. We're appealing to you, our [ORGANIZATION], to ask that you prioritize affordable housing over aesthetic nuance and let us move forward with a project that will provide crucial affordable housing for families who need it in [ORGANIZATION]. Please approve our design without the additional conditions imposed by [ORGANIZATION]."
11_23_2016,affordable housing,"Welcome. Mayor, Commissioners, my name is [ORGANIZATION], and I am here to read a letter to you that was composed by [ORGANIZATION] [TIME]. [ORGANIZATION] approved the Type 3 proposal for an affordable housing development at the intersection of FAC0 and FAC1 on DATE0."
11_23_2016,affordable housing,"Residents of publicly supported affordable housing buildings deserve the same benefits all other [ORGANIZATION] residents receive, to live in a building that doesn't stigmatize its residents and that is part of a vibrant, thoughtful, and deliberate urban infrastructure. Thank you. Actually, could you go into the design guidelines that the commission felt was not met?"
11_23_2016,affordable housing,"LAUGHTER  On this particular one, there's partly the issue it's an affordable housing project and that if it's just close... I mean, if it was an absolutely awful design, I would certainly support [ORGANIZATION]. But on this one, I do think that there's merit in both of them"
11_23_2016,affordable housing,councilman i appreciate the letter from [ORGANIZATION] i appreciate [ORGANIZATION]'s efforts uh renewed efforts to go to great lengths to get projects uh done quickly particularly affordable housing projects as it is very critical as we all know and i do find you know just as a lay person and i look at these two alternative designs like i don't know they both look nice to me
11_19_2015,homeless,"But anyways...  There's a path that leads the homeless problem. I mean, we have a homeless problem here, and there's a path down there that leads, and there's not secured. They can go down there, and the pictures I've seen, it's contaminated right now."
11_19_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"You all know that the demand for housing currently is outstripped. The demand for housing has outstripped supply. We need more multifamily and more single-family housing, and this plan provides a [STREET] to meet that demand, though it absolutely does not in and of itself solve the affordable housing crisis."
11_19_2015,houseless,"We represent over 30 organizations from community to labor to faith to immigrant to people of color to middle class to lower economic status, houseless and so forth, etc. When we talk about displacement for the black community, the negative effects of displacement have been there for a very long time. The history cannot be untied from the realities we see [ORGANIZATION]."
11_19_2015,homelessness,"This is what happened when we took the wrong path. Displacement of more than 10,000 people of color in [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]east in [ORGANIZATION]. Homelessness as bad as it's been in my lifetime."
11_19_2015,houseless,"And I think they've shown this really urgent and historic reasons for why we're really in this affordability crisis right now. We must act now, lest we go down an even more disastrous path in a future where people of color, those of low incomes, and the houseless are really segregated out of [ORGANIZATION] completely. Is this the legacy you want this council to have?"
11_19_2015,houseless,"We are houseless, we are renters, people of color, those of low incomes, those of middle incomes, homeowners, advocates, all here united to urge you that displacement and gentrification, displacement, you can end displacement and make gentrification a thing of the past. You have this opportunity to do what no one has ever done in [ORGANIZATION].  which is to tie our forward-thinking and progressive land use system to the values, true values of livability for all. Please, just say yes."
11_19_2015,affordable housing,"The mixed-use proposal will reduce the capacity of the commercial zones. but except when a developer takes advantage of the bonuses and gets additional FAR and a partial fifth floor by providing affordable housing, among others, but mostly it's affordable housing. Unfortunately, I've discovered that this bonus is only available in inner neighborhoods."
11_19_2015,affordable housing,"In addition, we've been talking with [ORGANIZATION] regarding urban renewal zones and planning and sustainability regarding affordable housing and student growth. As you know, [ORGANIZATION] consists of 12 square miles in [PERSON]. We have nine elementary schools, three middle schools, the largest high school in the state, and we also serve all of the children birth to five that have special needs throughout GPE2."
11_19_2015,housing crisis,"and i was at a  school and centennial recently where in part because of unstable housing in the community, 50 percent of the children who started on [ORGANIZATION] did not finish [LOCATION]. So if we want to put the housing crisis in stark relief, that's about as compelling a statistic as I can think of. The second is we're about to go into our budget."
11_19_2015,affordable housing,"During DATE0, we have participated and listened to the interests of the [ORGANIZATION] organization and the [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] community. I'm commencing DATE1 on the SWBA [ORGANIZATION]-Westmoreland Business Alliance as a board member, and I sit on ORG2. We've observed the [ORGANIZATION] interests and new developments in the area of concern to them in a recent survey that was conducted, as well as our [ORGANIZATION] meetings expressed, affordable housing and affordable commercial space, common area plazas, building curb appeal and setbacks, as well as parking."
11_19_2015,affordable housing,"We believe that our request for a 35-foot height on buildings, neighborhood corridor designation, one-on-one parking, and land use language that prevents the demolition of affordable housing is reasonable and doable in [ORGANIZATION] that we loved [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION], and hopefully DATE2. Thank you very much. Welcome."
11_19_2015,affordable housing,"Certainly there is room in the city the size of [ORGANIZATION] to keep such a historic neighborhood intact. Third, [PERSON] has some of the more affordable housing available in the city, such as small rental homes and older apartment buildings. New rentals will almost certainly be market rates, which are unaffordable for many."
11_19_2015,affordable housing,Increasing rental rates in the neighborhood will push older rentals to remodel and increase their rents. We'll lose affordable housing stock. Thank you.
11_19_2015,affordable housing,And now is the time to go for the bond. People know that we need affordable housing. People know we need the resources.
11_19_2015,affordable housing,"I want more of the corporations to begin to understand that we need you to start funding development projects for affordable housing. It is imperative that you do. If you want the skilled labor force to come into [ORGANIZATION], you also have to fund affordable housing."
11_19_2015,affordable housing,"And it's just on a voluntary basis and see if they can work with certain developers and fund them money on certain projects that are proposed to the larger corporation. It needs to be set up in that understanding if we want to have that skilled labor force involved. the family wage jobs, and the affordable housing, they have to step up also and offer that type of funding to these developers, which will be loans paid back to them, but the benefits throughout the community and to their corporations will be tremendous."
11_19_2015,homeless,"Mayor and commissioners, good evening. My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I've lived in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood for [ORGANIZATION] now. And first, Mayor, I'd like to thank you for opening the armory in [ORGANIZATION] to a [INSTITUTION]."
11_19_2015,affordable housing,"As you may know, it's the largest manufactured home park in the city of [ORGANIZATION]. It's a vital affordable housing resource, which is,  You've heard plenty of not only in this hearing and others is an important issue before the city. We're here with along with our written comments to make two comments or requests."
11_19_2015,affordable housing,"Okay. So two issues, one that I did submit a letter to all of you about and that we did to [ORGANIZATION] that the [ORGANIZATION] unanimously raised a big red flag concern about the proposed upzoning of the area on southeast...  [ORGANIZATION] and southeast LOC0 DATE0 That's an area that's a mix of [LOCATION] homes, many of which are used for affordable housing, as well as some nonconforming use, which are underlining zoning of R1."
12_20_2018,affordable housing,"I am pleased to be here [ORGANIZATION] with the fifth new affordable development under the [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]east Neighborhood Strategy, which prioritizes families and individuals with generational ties to [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]east [ORGANIZATION] for new affordable housing opportunities. The particular project we're here to talk about [TIME] is FAC0. It will be a new development on the corner of FAC1 and FAC2 in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood."
12_20_2018,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and ORG2 partnered on the solicitation in [ORGANIZATION], and [PERSON] was selected for the project. [PERSON] will be developing a four-story, 189-unit development, which will house over 380 people. Ten units will provide deeply affordable housing."
12_20_2018,affordable housing,"I am certainly pleased to see another 189 units of affordable housing come to the market. As Commissioner [PERSON] noted, these are all subject to the preference policy. I believe this project will contribute significantly to the promises made by the city to those impacted by prior urban redevelopment policies and actions in the [ORGANIZATION] study area."
12_20_2018,affordable housing,I'm program manager with our development incentives team. I'm here with our [ORGANIZATION] price cap resolution for [ORGANIZATION]. This price cap is also enacted for ORG1 and...  the LTIC transportation exemption that's available for home builders that therefore benefits affordable housing for primarily first-time homebuyers across the city.
12_20_2018,homeless; homelessness; affordable housing,"And whereas, within [ORGANIZATION], Commissioner [PERSON] is the only non-mayor to oversee [ORGANIZATION]. Whereas, in [LOCATION], GPE0 [PERSON] and Commissioner Dan [PERSON] partnered to merge the city and the county's efforts to address the crisis of individuals and families experiencing homelessness into one focused entity known as [ORGANIZATION]. And whereas Commissioner [PERSON] directed ORG2 and ORG3 to create the inclusionary housing policy that over time will create more affordable housing than any publicly funded effort.  and whereas his proudest accomplishment is creating the Portland Children Levy, which funds proven, cost-effective programs that achieve positive results for youth and their families."
12_20_2018,affordable housing,"Ever since you strolled in to my congressional office [ORGANIZATION] when I was a young congressman and you were a young engineer. Public service has been in your DNA. From the central city planning process to new transportation ideas, getting more affordable housing out there, making sure that the community is safe, you've been a stalwart partner."
12_20_2018,affordable housing,"The preference policy, and [ORGANIZATION] we added another 169 units to the preference policy in north-northeast [ORGANIZATION], that would not have gotten off the ground without Commissioner [PERSON], and it was a very, very cutting-edge and risky proposition when it was first proposed, and now here it is [PERSON], and it's working the [STREET] people had envisioned. [ORGANIZATION], that would not have come to fruition.  without Dan [PERSON]'s consistent push, courageous leadership, and his ability to really get into the weeds and problem-solve on how to make that a reality. And, of course, the inclusionary housing program that the city is currently undertaking, which...  as we noted earlier, over the long run is going to create more affordable housing than any other specific policy that we'll have the ability to put in [STREET] with regard to incentivization."
10_10_2018,homelessness,"Through this work, we continue to assess and ask who is excluded from digital society and why don't they use the internet. We know that cost, lack of accessible training opportunities in their language at good times and locations, lack of childcare and privacy concerns can be factors. We are working with our low-income housing partners and organizations that serve youth, people of color, immigrants, people with disabilities, people experiencing homelessness, and people in poverty."
10_10_2018,homeless,I'm PERSON0. I'm the founder and executive director of [ORGANIZATION]. We train homeless and marginalized youth in how to make movies.
10_10_2018,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] inclusion is the future, as it was in the graduate, as [ORGANIZATION] was in the graduate DATE0. You give a homeless kid a camera and let them tell their story on their own terms and get that story out there and  The young person is changed forever, but more importantly, the people that see it are also changed forever. Statistics can't change anybody's mind, but seeing somebody talk to you from the heart will."
10_10_2018,homeless,And these are the best tools that we can give these young people to bring them into the fold and make them the great citizens that they have the potential and definitely the desire to be. It works not just with homeless youth. I came [TIME] from an alternative school alliance at [ORGANIZATION] where we're teaching a workshop.
10_10_2018,homeless,"We're piloting a program for low-income seniors in [ORGANIZATION]. We're also piloting a program for homeless students in a school district in [PERSON], where we're working with the district to provide Internet for those who don't have a consistent and static [STREET] to live and go home to, but they're always connected through our Wi-Fi network. So that said, I have one little plug."
10_10_2018,affordable housing,for all their help over [ORGANIZATION] that they've been supporting the commission. In terms of what we're seeking from the city council for [LOCATION] is to really let [ORGANIZATION] be a part of the solution to some of the city's most pressing problems. And we can affirmatively state that we're not an enemy of increased density or affordable housing.
10_10_2018,affordable housing,"So I'm very pleased that you highlighted FAC0, which I guess got your highest award, [ORGANIZATION], and it really is an extraordinary conversion. And who knows? Someday there may be affordable housing in a parks facility that's adjacent, so we'll see."
10_10_2018,affordable housing,"As [ORGANIZATION] wrestles to grow without sprawling and to increase the amount of affordable housing, I just want to seize this opportunity to reiterate that preservation and density do indeed go hand in hand. I think you all know and have heard us say many, many times that historic neighborhoods are already dense and can be made even more so. The key is compatibility and incentives for retention of the existing buildings."
10_10_2018,homelessness; affordable housing,"We also believe that preservation is essential to the war on homelessness. Historic buildings are a major source of affordable housing. Just ask organizations like [ORGANIZATION], and [ORGANIZATION], among others, who have adapted historic buildings for that very purpose."
09_21_2017,homeless,"And I can tell you that while that project did not have all the twists and the turns of this, [ORGANIZATION], there were many who thought it would never happen and that our three historic steam locomotives would be homeless. Thank you. And it took the same kind of spirit of people coming together and saying, we're not going to take no for an answer, and we're going to do every workaround necessary to make it happen."
10_11_2017,homeless,"For one, I run [ORGANIZATION], nonprofit for homeless kids. We're in a masonry building, which may or may not be on the list. There's some conflicting reports."
10_11_2017,homeless,"Thank you. Also, my job is to [STREET] homeless young people in affordable homes. And as you may know, I have kids with vouchers, and we can't find affordable homes for them to go into."
10_11_2017,affordable housing,"It means to me that even though this is major construction to do parapets, cornices, and chimneys, that can be done without displacing tenants. We've spent the time and the money to accurately come up with a picture of what it would cost for our individual building to do this work. There's approximately 7,000 similar units in [ORGANIZATION], 1,800 of which are part of [ORGANIZATION]'s publicly financed affordable housing."
10_11_2017,homeless,"No, no, it's helpful. A portion of those identify as homeless. Others are in a version of a shelter or with a family or friend, but it's not a stable situation."
10_11_2017,homeless,"And really, all the existing vulnerability indexes and assessments that we had available to us either didn't take domestic violence into account at all, or it was just one question on an assessment that really didn't dig into what an advocate would ask  When we're talking about vulnerability for survivors. What makes a single adult vulnerable in the homeless system or a family vulnerable in the homeless family system is a really different kind of vulnerability than what we're talking about when we're talking about domestic violence survivors. It looks really different."
10_11_2017,homeless,"It's also been called a gamer trail, as the police have informed me. And there's a deeply wooded hillside there. And with this hillside, the homeless have gravitated to it because it's a bad actor's dream."
10_11_2017,homeless,"Now, I have called the city numerous times. They even ask me, does this involve the homeless, and they go to non-emergency, and I hang for [TIME]. You know, it just doesn't work."
10_11_2017,homeless,"And our intent in presenting to those students is not just to talk to them about [ORGANIZATION], but talk to them about college and how the opportunities of college can exist for them. I want to be clear, this is not a high-achieving, merit-based scholarship. We're focused on students who have access to  [ORGANIZATION], free and reduced lunch, the homeless youth continuum here in [ORGANIZATION], and former foster care alumni."
10_11_2017,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], we had a hearing [TIME] [ORGANIZATION]. Well, we had some testimony about unreinforced masonry buildings. And one of the issues that I'm going to be focusing on is how do we make our affordable housing inventory safer without imposing exorbitant costs on our nonprofit partners."
10_11_2017,housing crisis; affordable housing,"Thank you, [ORGANIZATION]. Colleagues, DATE0 I'm very proud to bring to you an exciting milestone and a step in the right direction to addressing [ORGANIZATION]'s housing crisis. [ORGANIZATION] voters made history when they passed the city's first affordable housing bond with an overwhelming 62% of the vote."
10_11_2017,affordable housing,"At $258 million, the [ORGANIZATION] Housing Bond is the largest general obligation bond ever passed by [ORGANIZATION] voters, and it's a first-of-its-kind funding mechanism for our city. These resources will allow the city to create an additional 1,300 units of affordable housing. Because this is an historic opportunity to stabilize families and mitigate displacement, we wanted to make sure that we got it right."
10_11_2017,affordable housing,"I'd like to briefly cover the major milestones we've accomplished together. As you know, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] voters approved the state's first voter-approved funding measure for affordable housing. In [LOCATION], under direction of Mayor [PERSON], an 18-member public advisory body was appointed to develop a policy framework to guide the city and further bond investments."
10_11_2017,affordable housing,"We will advance racial equity for communities disproportionately impacted by the shortage of affordable housing options, by housing discrimination, by gentrification, and by involuntary displacement. This bond will support opportunity through citywide investments that offer broad access to public amenities like transportation, schools, food, and grocery stores. We will be resourceful by making responsible investments in housing solutions with innovation and creativity."
10_11_2017,homeless,"And we are already working with [ORGANIZATION] to plan for those units as we develop and acquire new housing. And now I'd like to turn it over to [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION], who led most of the stakeholder advisory group process very ably. Thank you, [PERSON]."
10_11_2017,homelessness,"It's a pleasure to be here [TIME]. Thank you. The framework provides priority communities for bond resources to further our community-wide goals of preventing displacement, advancing racial equity, and also making a visible impact on ending homelessness in our community."
10_11_2017,homeless; homelessness; housing crisis,"By aligning with our homeless service system, culturally specific and other community partners, we'll create housing for communities that are disproportionately affected by the housing crisis, with a particular focus on communities of color, families, including families with children, immigrants and refugees, and intergenerational households. We also want to focus on creating opportunities for households experiencing homelessness or facing imminent displacement. In the process of identifying these communities, the advisory group reviewed and was informed by data from [ORGANIZATION] and the point-in-time count of homelessness."
10_11_2017,homelessness; housing crisis,"These reports and others show that [ORGANIZATION]'s housing crisis disproportionately impacts people of color, low-income families, and individuals and families experiencing homelessness. The data clearly shows that there are large areas in our city where communities of color cannot afford to rent anything larger than a studio apartment. This is also true for low-income families and immigrants."
10_11_2017,homeless,"In our most recent point in time count, we have more than 4,000 people who are homeless in our community on any given night, more than 40% of whom are persons of color. And also, our current city's housing stock is heavily weighted towards smaller size units, which emphasizes the need for more affordable family size larger units. Thank you."
10_11_2017,affordable housing,"On the important question of location, the framework clearly calls out [ORGANIZATION] will use a racial equity lens and analysis at the forefront of when we assess and make selections around opportunities. The projects will be selected with a focus on the following priorities. We want to invest where there is little or no existing current affordable housing or resources."
10_11_2017,affordable housing,"When you're saying that [ORGANIZATION]'s currently little or no affordable housing, in the past that's meant that we've put a lot of money into places like [ORGANIZATION]. Yeah. So could you just explain that?"
10_11_2017,affordable housing,URAs typically cover only 15% of our city. Okay. So there are large portions where we don't actually have a number of affordable housing.
10_11_2017,affordable housing,"So as we move forward in this process, I first must go back a little and recognize that we would not have reached this historic moment without the many who have come to this very room, to this very table, and passionately implored and passionately urged all of us to get to this moment. People like [ORGANIZATION], who passionately implored you to declare a housing emergency,  People like PERSON1 and PERSON2 at [ORGANIZATION], who over [ORGANIZATION] have gently and not so gently reminded us of the shortage of affordable housing in our community for those extremely low-income individuals. And people like [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], who tirelessly advocated for additional local funding for affordable housing."
10_11_2017,affordable housing,"And so now it's our time, and this is that moment that we waited for. And this is us as a community, a community that invests in affordable housing equitably, justly, quickly, efficiently, and consistently in times to come for all of its members, especially those who have been most harmed and who are most vulnerable. We need to recognize that this new resource that we have cannot and will not serve all the needs of all of our populations."
10_11_2017,affordable housing,"Thank you. You know that I believe housing is not only a human right, but also the underlying pathway to opportunity. As an organization that's focused on ending housing discrimination and ensuring equal housing opportunity for all, we approach these affordable housing efforts with a specific focus."
10_11_2017,homeless,"We are starting to gentrify, so we feel it's really important that we look at vulnerability areas  displacement, those items that are in the criteria as key in selection of property as well as buildings. I, [ORGANIZATION], David [ORGANIZATION] alone, which you know I'm on the school board, has experienced in 15, [DATE], over 400 students who are identified as homeless by [ORGANIZATION]. DATE1 it was over 500."
10_11_2017,affordable housing,"is those estimates have always been underestimated, and we've always gotten more than what they estimated we would do. But [ORGANIZATION] is planning for any increase also. We're just watching the numbers and trying to work with our populations and the nonprofits that are building affordable housing out there so we can get placement for our families to stay."
10_11_2017,affordable housing,"And so what we've heard in the past is we'd like more home ownership, less of the affordable housing. What I think...  has been problematic about that approach is that there is still a concentration of low-income families attending schools there that have the right to live in safe and decent housing. And so it's been almost a schizophrenic approach."
10_11_2017,affordable housing,"But you're particularly concerned about upgrading the existing stock so that we have an inventory of really decent housing going forward, and that might play into our investment strategy. Yeah, we have said for some time the stock out in [ORGANIZATION] is inferior, the private sector stock. I strongly support [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] and the others that have developed, as we call it, affordable housing by design."
10_11_2017,affordable housing,"When I was on the [ORGANIZATION], because I have that school hat I can wear, and that's why you saw catchment areas mentioned, is that when you get too many affordable housing, whether it's design or not design, it puts additional costs on a school district. Right. Because children of lower income don't usually have preschool, et cetera, and they require extra services."
10_11_2017,affordable housing,"I spoke [TIME] at a conference for finance professionals, so obviously I'm just for them. [ORGANIZATION]'s strategic... We're [ORGANIZATION] into our most recent strategic plan, and in the plan there is an initiative that says we will work tirelessly to add more affordable housing in our community regardless of our role or ownership stake in alignment with other systems of care."
10_11_2017,affordable housing,"And so...  We have our own agenda to add more affordable housing in our portfolio to preserve the housing that we have in our stock, but we are also committed to the idea that our experience, our systems, our infrastructure, our data, our resources, our public assets to be leveraged for the greatest good in the community. And that idea...  that we are obligated to contribute to policies and to the creation of housing resources that serve our cities and county for [ORGANIZATION] to come, is why we're contributing vouchers and why we're working closely with [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] and PERSON2 to figure out how we can best leverage the capacities between both our public agencies so the bond resources are delivered with maximum long-term benefits for the community. Thank you."
10_11_2017,homeless; homelessness,"And then under households experiencing homelessness or at a risk of becoming homeless, I've added a bullet that says youth [ORGANIZATION] from the foster care system. So I think we all know that. Cluster kids, they turn [LOCATION] and they are basically without any resources and too many of them end up on our streets, on our couches, or even more dire circumstances."
10_11_2017,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON].  all have come to the conclusion after lots of money they spend, lots of time, that you must get the chronic homeless off the streets first. And here's why. They're the most expensive."
10_11_2017,affordable housing,People will argue about putting a drunk in housing. You have to get these people off the [STREET]. Low-income people that are struggling on the [STREET] have nothing to do with affordable housing.
10_11_2017,affordable housing,"Nothing. Your theory...  is let's build affordable housing, get the people out of the emergency shelters, and then we can move the people off the [STREET] into emergency shelters. Look at what [ORGANIZATION] is telling you."
10_11_2017,affordable housing,It is a little over a third of the population of our region. And it has two-thirds of the affordable housing in our region. And we need more.
10_11_2017,homelessness,"We have to start addressing this as a regional problem, and that's going to require a real shift in the [STREET] we think about these social problems. It is very easy for people to look at the city of [ORGANIZATION] and say, wow, [ORGANIZATION] really struggles with housing issues, homelessness issues, addiction issues, mental health issues, transportation issues, fill-in-the-blank issues. But the reality is..."
10_11_2017,affordable housing,"And I do think those leaders around the region are starting to really understand the affordable housing challenge, and now is our opportunity to give them some choices to get behind and really make a difference. You bet. It's good to see you."
10_11_2017,homeless,"Thank you. Mayor and Commissioners, I'm [PERSON], and I am the Director of [ORGANIZATION]. And I just wanted to take a moment to start by thanking all of those community members who made this bond possible."
10_11_2017,homeless; homelessness,"To thank you, Mayor, your team, and the team at [ORGANIZATION] for the process that they led to get us to this framework. I'm, of course, particularly appreciative of the focus in the framework on people experiencing homelessness and at risk of homelessness, and in particular, people from communities of color who we know are significantly overrepresented in our homeless population. We're really enthusiastic about the focus on family-sized units because we see hundreds and hundreds of people and families in our shelters [TIME]."
10_11_2017,homeless; homelessness; affordable housing,"You know from our last point in time count that the chronically homeless population was the fastest growing population in our community, a 24% increase over [ORGANIZATION]. That increase accounted for most of the increase we saw in our community in homelessness overall. For that population, the combination of deeply affordable housing with support services is often the only path off the streets in a sustainable [STREET]."
10_11_2017,affordable housing,"We also know in our office that the bond is only providing for the housing portion of the costs associated with supportive housing. And that's why, as was mentioned earlier, our office is committed to continuing to work with [ORGANIZATION] to identify the resources that are needed to provide the ongoing services that will turn that affordable housing into supportive housing. We look forward to being a full partner with [ORGANIZATION] going forward on the implementation of this framework."
10_11_2017,affordable housing,"I'm here [ORGANIZATION] as a member of the business community and as a member of [ORGANIZATION]. And first and foremost, I want to thank [PERSON] for your continued support for increasing our supply of safe, stable, and affordable housing. ORG2 was a proud supporter of this historic housing bond."
10_11_2017,housing crisis,It's a problem that touches all of us and that we need to solve together. We are very grateful for [ORGANIZATION]'s leadership and for the collaborative efforts of ORG1 and the ORG2 staff that has enabled our city to set an example for how to address a regional housing crisis. Thank you.
10_11_2017,affordable housing,"It's my belief that [ORGANIZATION] stands ready and committed to continuing to work collaboratively to advance strategies that bring more dollars to our region for affordable housing, especially for communities of color. We believe that the rigorous, deliberate stakeholder approach that you've led will truly leverage fully the bond investments to create housing for our most vulnerable families and individuals, balanced across all sectors of our city,  while at the same time advancing racial equity and preventing displacement. So we're proud to be here [ORGANIZATION] to celebrate this accomplishment."
10_11_2017,affordable housing,[ORGANIZATION] is a member of [ORGANIZATION]. We'd like to thank ORG2 for continued support for increasing our affordable housing stock and for this initiative. unprecedented opportunity implementing the bond.
10_11_2017,affordable housing,Then I'd echo some previous points about encouraging [ORGANIZATION] to partner with the nonprofit affordable housing community to develop and manage bond projects. [ORGANIZATION] have the capacity to develop and operate these projects. We have a long track record in existing relationships in the neighborhoods and with service providers.
10_11_2017,housing crisis,"So Mayor [PERSON], city councilors, and friends and colleagues here [ORGANIZATION], my name is [PERSON], and I am the new director of [ORGANIZATION]. i'm primarily here [ORGANIZATION] to say thank you [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] my friend and colleague PERSON2 sat in front of you and said that the city needed to take bold and courageous action to solve this housing crisis and in [LOCATION] that is exactly what you have done thank you for setting example of innovation taking risk and creating needed solutions to build more housing within our region  I also want on [PERSON] to recognize everyone in this audience who took the time to knock on doors, to make phone calls, and dedicate [TIME] and [PERSON] to ensuring that this would happen. We're grateful for their energy."
10_11_2017,housing crisis,"I think it's important during the middle of a housing crisis to celebrate wins. It's a very trauma-informed approach to recognize good moments. With that said, I want to also thank [ORGANIZATION], specifically [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], and [LOCATION]."
10_11_2017,affordable housing,"We took words, we took language, and we eliminated it because folks didn't agree with it. And that is a very transformational process when it comes to stakeholder engagement. [ORGANIZATION] is going in the right direction, maintaining longevity and permanent covenants on communities and affordable housing."
10_11_2017,affordable housing,"When you think about families, when you think about children, when you think about...  our community members who can't really find affordable housing even though they work a lot and they they're, they're, they're taxpayer, right? They're working a lot to contribute to community but because they can't find a [STREET] to stay and where they call home for, for themselves to be home, it's really difficult for  for like us, like community leaders or someone who works for a non-profit and we feel really helpless because we have no resources.  for them to help, right? We call like, you know, third-gen apartments."
10_11_2017,affordable housing,"We call so many affordable housing places, but there's no units available for people to be part of it. So having more affordable housing, especially out of [ORGANIZATION], will be very useful. And then those families who work hard will contribute to this society can actually call, you know, stay in the apartment and their kids can go to school they wanted to do so their kids don't have to move to school every day  [ORGANIZATION], right?"
10_11_2017,affordable housing,"So I also want to thank you everyone, mayors and commissioners, for working hard to ensure that we get more affordable housing in the city. Thank you for your testimony. Appreciate it."
10_11_2017,affordable housing,"I want to thank you for allowing me and other members of the community to provide input on the bond implementation framework. We learned a lot from each other and about the people in our community who are usually left out of decision making, including those who are in desperate need of safe, affordable housing. A significant challenge for this stakeholder advisory group was making responsible recommendations regarding the bond without knowing the city's overall housing strategy or plan, you know, what the city's housing priorities are, what resources you have to address them, et cetera."
10_11_2017,homeless,"So I really want to push you to push your staff to be as flexible and creative as possible to get the most leverage out of these bonds, use these community resources to get the most out of all of our resources and house the most people. City can't come close to solving our homeless crisis alone please reach out to and involve the community more the bond stakeholder advisory group was a great effort please do more and we've been the most successful in this community when we have been inclusive and worked together thank you again for allowing me to participate and for your time DATE0 and for allowing me to go a little bit over thank you very much thank you it's excellent testimony we appreciate it and  In fact, we are going through an internal exercise where this is completely germane. So I wanted you to keep going a little bit."
10_11_2017,homeless,"And we should just do whatever we can to get them through ORG0 immediately. Okay.  and obviously working with state and other funders to streamline the process. So we have 4,000 homeless people, 1,600 unsheltered people."
10_11_2017,affordable housing,"Yes, sure. Because we really have devoted an extraordinary amount of time and resources to working out some of the issues with the [ORGANIZATION], from updating the software to working with all the permitting bureaus to uncork those bottlenecks and streamline the price process. We're absolutely prioritizing affordable housing."
10_11_2017,affordable housing,"So for some of the small-time operators, there will be that kind of assistance that you're talking about. And I'm certainly interested in considering that.  another level of assistance for affordable housing developers in general. Great."
10_11_2017,housing crisis; affordable housing,"My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I'm a member of the executive team at [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and also here as a member of ORG2. ORG3 did not participate in the initial stakeholder advisory group that helped to craft this current framework, but as a member of the current, or as a current member of [LOCATION], we are committed to continuing to work with the city and with [ORGANIZATION] to advance solutions that bring additional revenue for affordable housing, and specifically for communities of color. We appreciate the council's commitment to addressing the growing housing crisis, and also appreciate the specific lens of racial equity that has been used to develop the current framework."
10_11_2017,housing crisis,"We understand that this is, has been, and will continue to be a very difficult task. We also understand that addressing the housing crisis through a lens of restorative justice is a complicated and time-consuming task. As a participant in [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] is committed to working towards solutions that our community can see working immediately."
10_11_2017,affordable housing,"And we will do our part, everything that we can, to ensure that tangible progress is being made, even within the time-consuming process that will take [STREET] through the [ORGANIZATION] facilitation of this bond measure. Additionally,  As we continue to focus on prioritizing restorative justice and racial equity, [ORGANIZATION] will be emphasizing through our role with [ORGANIZATION], as well as through our role as a voice for our community, that the African American community needs to be given realistic options to access affordable housing that is acquired or developed through this bond in [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]east neighborhoods that so many of our community have been displaced from. We understand that this bond is not a vehicle to completely reverse the effects of displacement and gentrification that has taken [STREET] in our traditional community neighborhoods, but we do want to do what we can to ensure that displaced African Americans have options to return when possible, and that will be in addition to the stated goals in the bond framework to provide accessible and affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION] neighborhoods, such as LOC2 in [PERSON], where many communities of color currently reside."
10_11_2017,homeless,"I actually think that in the sense of marginal statistics, as we've seen with the increasing need in homeless services that have  The need may actually increase as time goes on, as costs, rents go up faster than median family incomes. And that may be even more powerful for those below MFI [DATE], AMI [DATE], and probably gains power as you work your [STREET] down to 30. And then the other, below 30, it's different because of other subsidies, perhaps."
10_11_2017,affordable housing,"There have been arguments about, which I think is the approach and goal, because there have been arguments that you don't want to put all of your affordable housing in, say, an area that has received so much of it, which the [ORGANIZATION] have been funded to. Is that correct? Yes."
10_11_2017,affordable housing,"The [STREET] I read this document, [ORGANIZATION], there would be a priority for non-URAs. That's how I read it. We've already made the investment in 15%, and there's lots of areas that don't have affordable housing, so there would be necessarily a priority for those areas."
10_11_2017,homeless,"They don't like the idea because they think it's going to be too close and too many people and it's going to be a jumbled mess. As I stated at the other meetings, it's going to be a magnet for all the homeless people, which is going to be a disaster in the [ORGANIZATION] area."
10_11_2017,homelessness,"I don't have enough time to get near what I need to say out. I'll say this. You're trying to solve homelessness, and you may agree on this statement.  proposal, but do you agree on the cause of homelessness?"
10_11_2017,homeless,"There are so many, the homeless population is one of the most diverse populations there are, and it goes from, it's more the outliers that you're dealing with. Oh my God, it's too much. I want to know why people can't buy hot meals with their [ORGANIZATION] because if you know [ORGANIZATION]'s hierarchy, you know that shelter comes on the bottom, but I'm going to say that temperature precedes that."
10_11_2017,homelessness,And I also want to know if you agree on the causes of homelessness. Yes.  Thank you. Thank you.
10_11_2017,homelessness,"that if we're really going to get our arms around chronic homelessness, we must have a strategy which addresses people who have faced the biggest barriers. And if we do not spend the money marrying intensive services with housing, we're not going to have successful outcomes. And that, by the [STREET], was actually the hallmark of the [ORGANIZATION] plan."
10_11_2017,affordable housing,"I have to say I've waited [ORGANIZATION] to have [ORGANIZATION] or someone from [ORGANIZATION] come to us and say, we want our fair share of affordable housing, and make the argument that people who are low income and are going to school districts in [ORGANIZATION] deserve the same choices and quality that other people have. And it's not just home ownership. So I think that was something of a breakthrough."
10_11_2017,housing crisis,"And finally, I want to close on... Kind of a sour note we heard from a number of people that somehow this would not solve our housing crisis and that somehow this had been mismarketed. This alone is not going to solve our housing crisis."
10_11_2017,homelessness,"Any more than 2,000 units of permanent supportive housing is going to solve our homelessness crisis. But I would remind people that you have to go back to [ORGANIZATION]. and [PERSON], who [ORGANIZATION] upstream said, if we starve the beast in [ORGANIZATION], we'll create a series of train wrecks down the line in the local government."
10_11_2017,housing crisis,"PERSON0. As was said many times over [ORGANIZATION] and [LOCATION], we're in a housing crisis. The time for action is clearly upon us, and this council does have a sense of urgency with regard to the problem."
10_11_2017,affordable housing,"We heard from members of the immigrant and refugee community,  that discriminatory practices were preventing them from finding quality, affordable housing. The oversight committee or the advisory committee, [ORGANIZATION], has told us they want that to be part of this framework. We heard from elected officials and community leaders that this is the experience of families across the metro area and throughout the state of [ORGANIZATION]."
10_31_2018,homeless,"about livability issues. Crime, trash, litter, the homeless, and so on. And we're a growing city."
10_31_2018,homeless,"Actually, they're the...  ugly concrete rounds that get picked by homeless folks seeking the recycling. And we wanted to put five of those cans there as well. But right now, [ORGANIZATION] is kind of more comfortable with the cans they have right now."
10_31_2018,homeless,"We're going to have a community-wide conversation about livability issues, ranging from trash to graffiti to crime to the homeless situation,  There will be an opportunity for the community to come out and learn more about what the city is doing, how we can work together. The theme is communities and government working together. It will be at the main stage."
10_31_2018,affordable housing,"Yeah, I think that would be a good thing to do, and then maybe if there were affordable housing or other projects that might need some assistance to do those energy efficiency, you could use the fund for that, for example. We can certainly research that. Commissioner [PERSON]."
10_31_2018,homeless,"Any city money going to the parks right now? You can fill all the parks in with concrete, build a wall, whatever.  because right now with all the homeless people and the people being kicked out of shelters or not wanting to go into shelters because they're so unhealthy, you've got transgender people who can't use the bathroom in FAC0 because you've closed it  and elderly and disabled. The woman who was kicked out of ORG0 because her bed wasn't paid for [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION] or DATE2 night she was kicked out."
10_31_2018,homeless,"If the homeless come, they arrest them or chase them off, or they pull...  the stuff that people use to use the park there, the chess boards or the games, they'll just pull them. So let's just build a wall around all the parks and fill them in with concrete because you're only going to let certain people use the facilities, the bathrooms. So yeah, you're arresting homeless women who come in there and scream because she needs adult protective services."
10_31_2018,homeless,"Fair enough. Thank you. Senators need to stop paying for discrimination against elders, disabled, and homeless."
10_31_2018,homeless,"PERSON0 [PERSON]. Welcome. On a similar topic of which I had discussed on [DATE], I, in the future, will mention one person's name who's a great homeless advocate is [ORGANIZATION]."
10_31_2018,homeless,"And I know in [ORGANIZATION] what happened in the park, it was a federal park, in which he tried to establish a homeless encampment, and it was slammed down. I'm not here to say that that was a perfect [STREET] to do that, but again, I favor putting homeless people in parks in a very controlled fashion. I'm a supporter of [ORGANIZATION], and I know that she may put [PERSON] on her staff."
10_31_2018,homeless,"PERSON0... And I meant about the Homeless Bill of Rights in [ORGANIZATION], in which I met you, Mayor [PERSON], and you were trying to get FAC0 built. Now, it will be built, and it may send and dispatch paramedics to homeless people who are cold or something, but I understand homeless people will not be allowed to stay there."
10_31_2018,homeless,"At the [INSTITUTION], there are African Americans and other homeless people begging me for money. And I thought the navigation center...  would move people under FAC0 or move them away. I do know [ORGANIZATION] is very concerned about homeless people sleeping right on the [INSTITUTION] property."
12_05_2018,affordable housing,"Well, we're making fast time [ORGANIZATION]. Next individual, please. Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]."
12_05_2018,affordable housing,"Consent agenda items are routine city administrative business, but [ORGANIZATION]'s consent agenda had a couple of items that I just want to briefly highlight. DATE1 we codify the results of the DATE2 election, specifically measures 26-200 and 26-201. We also have three inclusionary housing projects, which will provide 134 units of new rental housing, including 13 affordable housing units."
12_05_2018,affordable housing,"Good morning, Mayor and Commissioners. I'm pleased to be here [TIME] to bring you this exciting new affordable housing project from [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], located on the corner of FAC0 and FAC1. It's my honor to be here [ORGANIZATION] with [ORGANIZATION]'s Executive Director, [ORGANIZATION], who served [ORGANIZATION] and her community for [LOCATION], and [ORGANIZATION]'s PERSON1 and PERSON2."
12_05_2018,affordable housing,"Thirty-five percent of the units are set aside for very low-income families. The project is estimated to provide 198 new residents permanent affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]east. This project is part of the city's comprehensive [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]east Neighborhood Strategy, which both acknowledges and works to address our actions in regards to gentrification and displacement."
12_05_2018,homeless,"This project, [ORGANIZATION], will prioritize families with long-term ties to the [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]east neighborhood and those who've experienced displacement, as well as serving 20 formerly homeless families with long-term voucher support. [ORGANIZATION] has partnered with ORG2 and [PERSON] and expects to well exceed the city's requirements for minority women and emerging business participation. I believe [PERSON] and her team will talk a little bit more about that, but they're expecting to reach 30% participation."
12_05_2018,affordable housing,"From the city, we have $5.7 million in loans from [ORGANIZATION], additionally the contribution of the land. And from [ORGANIZATION], we have [ORGANIZATION] waivers, property tax exemption that's administered through ORG2 in partnership with [ORGANIZATION], and the Affordable Housing CET waiver. And additionally, home forward, we were awarded 20 project-based Section 8 waivers.  which allow us to lower the rent for our residents."
12_05_2018,homeless,"Commissioner, most of the families are coming out of the homeless families service system, and they will be coming with service supports. But we have not required permanent supportive housing as an additional requirement on this project. And that was part of the [ORGANIZATION]?"
12_05_2018,homeless,"No.  The [ORGANIZATION] submitted the [ORGANIZATION] in serving homeless families, but we have not done an additional requirement for permanent supportive housing on this building other than the requirement for the 20 families that the [ORGANIZATION] already submitted for coming out of the homeless family system, which will have services. But the additional units will be prioritized from the [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]east preference policy strategy. Thank you."
12_05_2018,affordable housing,"And so looking at how we can have an organization like ORG0 kind of lead the [STREET] in showing how we can address  the issues that exist in our communities around not only affordable housing, but the poverty that causes the need for it. Commissioner [PERSON] has talked about permanent supportive housing. And when I think about that term, I'm thinking, like, why does permanent  situations have to exist."
12_05_2018,affordable housing,What is it? Can we do to look more deeply into what's causing that situation and come up with solutions? That's what we did with affordable housing.
12_05_2018,homeless,"[LOCATION], there are two populations that are prioritized for this building. One is families coming out of the homeless family system that will be supported by vouchers from [ORGANIZATION]. So people with very low incomes will be able to afford permanent housing for themselves and family."
12_05_2018,homeless; affordable housing,and also the priority of families or households that have historic ties or have been displaced from [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]east [ORGANIZATION] who would like to come back to [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]east [ORGANIZATION]. Both of these preferences have been thoroughly reviewed by fair housing attorneys and comply with fair housing law. So we're addressing both displacement and homeless families as well as adding new affordable housing stock with this project.
12_05_2018,homeless,"So congratulations to [ORGANIZATION]. One of the things that I really like about this development is that of the 70 units, all of them will be affordable at 60 percent of MFI or below. And what that means is people on fixed incomes, people who are entry-level workers, people starting out, formerly homeless, are  In other words, it will be serving people that the market is not serving right now."
12_05_2018,affordable housing,"when it comes to housing those of lower income or people who lack access to safe and affordable housing in our community. We all started at FAC0 with that ribbon-cutting ceremony. Then DATE0 we were at the [ORGANIZATION],  [PERSON]-cutting ceremony [TIME]."
12_05_2018,affordable housing,"We added a number of multi-units to our affordable housing mix, and now we have FAC0 and FAC1 to celebrate. I couldn't be happier to see these 70 units of affordable housing being added to the city's stock. And, of course, it's mostly targeted for northeast areas."
12_05_2018,affordable housing,What? You're back again and you want 173 more units of affordable housing? We are.
12_05_2018,homelessness,"It adds an additional 20 new units of low-barrier housing. And it seismically upgrades an unreinforced masonry building in the heart of the central city, ensuring resident safety and protecting an important community asset for [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] to come. The [ORGANIZATION] serves a high needs population who receive supportive services and are transitioning from homelessness."
12_05_2018,homelessness; affordable housing,I am PERSON0 with [ORGANIZATION]. FAC0 has long been a workforce in both [ORGANIZATION]s and the city's ending homelessness efforts. It's a rather unique affordable housing resource offering both transitional and permanent housing options to people with very high barriers to traditional housing pathways.
12_05_2018,homeless,"Programs in the building include those serving homeless veterans, people transitioning from corrections, and recuperative care for homeless individuals with acute health conditions. You can see some of the outcomes of the building's programs on this slide. Over 750 people are served [ORGANIZATION] in FAC0."
12_05_2018,affordable housing,"And so we're really looking to do an overall upgrade and put this project into use for [ORGANIZATION]. As [ORGANIZATION] mentioned, one of the aspects we're most excited about as part of this preservation is that we have found a [STREET] to add 20 additional new units of affordable housing into the building. This was accomplished by better utilization of space around light wells as well as capture of some of the first floor commercial space and was really no small victory given the fact that this is a building on the historic register and we had to go through [ORGANIZATION] approval, which if any of you have done that before, it's a timely and complicated endeavor."
12_05_2018,homelessness,"You can still see the marble steps and areas of the building related to that use. We're also improving and expanding the community and service space in the building, which will help to strengthen our outcomes, which really are focused around health, income attainment, and social connectedness, all of which are vital for long-term improved resiliency to homelessness. And as also mentioned, we're seismically strengthening the building, including all new seismic cores, diaphragms, and masonry attachments."
12_05_2018,affordable housing,"Well, the city is obviously pleased to see the addition of these new affordable housing units and the preservation of many, many others. The need is clearly withering. So this is something that's pretty easy to get behind."
10_12_2016,homeless,"Thank you, [ORGANIZATION]. As part of the [ORGANIZATION] budget approval in [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION] allocated $350,000 to a housing emergency community engagement plan spearheaded by [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] also directed ORG2 to work with [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION] and ORG6 to return to [ORGANIZATION] with a collaborative proposal."
10_12_2016,homeless,"At that time, Commissioner [PERSON] and his office directed that [PERSON], the Director of [ORGANIZATION], will serve as the primary representative for developing the programme with ORG1 staff and community members. This stakeholder group worked throughout [ORGANIZATION] to develop a proposal which they will share with you [PERSON]. Before I ask PERSON2 to begin the presentation, I'm going to pass out the amendment that was in the DATE2 memo, but there's another copy of it.  that it amends the strategy number four to, it now reads, information coordination and communication."
10_12_2016,homeless; homelessness,"The project grantees will work together with a home for everyone and [ORGANIZATION] to inform the public about the action plan to end homelessness for [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]. The Mayor's [PERSON], One Points of Contact, [ORGANIZATION], and [ORGANIZATION] to Engage in Efforts to End the Housing Emergency. And secondly, under B, Distribution of Information."
10_12_2016,homeless,"Grantee organizations will work closely with staff, coordinator, and [ORGANIZATION], and [ORGANIZATION] on a communication strategy. Okay, so if we could just move that and Mr. [PERSON] [TIME] it, so we have the amendment before us and we're ready for the presentation. Thank you."
10_12_2016,homeless,"I want to thank you, Mayor [PERSON], Commissioners [PERSON], PERSON2, and [ORGANIZATION], for consideration of this proposal. I want to thank Commissioner [PERSON] for her leadership and support for this proposal. I'm going to provide an overview of the plan, followed by PERSON4 with [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]."
10_12_2016,housing crisis; houseless; housing insecurity,"[ORGANIZATION] Engagement Plan will provide resources for community and neighborhood groups to constructively affect the current housing crisis and its impacts on our communities and neighborhoods, particularly with an emphasis on engaging individuals experiencing housing insecurity, low-income tenants, and the houseless. Why this project? Um...  Those with lived experience with being houseless and low-income residents who are at risk of becoming houseless have historically been underrepresented in government decision-making processes, those issues with a direct impact on their lives."
10_12_2016,housing crisis,"And additionally...  Many community and neighborhood activists had identified a need for more public information about the city's strategy for addressing the housing crisis, and they wanted to know what opportunities exist for community engagement so they could be constructively involved with solutions to the housing instability in our community. These are issues that came up, as Commissioner said, [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] when community leaders brought these issues to us through our budget advisory committee process DATE2. So subsequently, [ORGANIZATION] approved this [ORGANIZATION] $350,000 with a budget note that we would return to ORG1 for approval of a plan."
10_12_2016,houseless,"[ORGANIZATION] working directly with low-income tenants and houseless participated in those meetings, including representatives from [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, [PERSON], [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION], ORG6, ORG7, and ORG8. I'll get that. That group identified outcomes that we wanted to accomplish working together, that our communities will be more informed about [ORGANIZATION]."
10_12_2016,homelessness; housing crisis; housing insecurity,"We'll be more informed about the one point of contact and various opportunities, how people can be engaged in constructive efforts to help end the housing crisis. Two, community organizations working with individuals and families experiencing housing insecurity and homelessness will have expanded capacity to be able to engage more people and provide broader forums for the community to express their concerns, their needs, and issues that they want to organize around on these issues. Secondly, those organizations will be able to expand their capacity to build power to affect policy change and some of the long-term solutions towards ending the housing crisis."
10_12_2016,homeless; homelessness,"And lastly, [ORGANIZATION]'s partner groups will have expanded capacity to collaborate with each other and other community-based groups and government agencies to better inform their constituencies about what's going on and how they can get involved in long-term solutions. So specifically our strategies that we propose in the plan. One, project grantees will work together with [PERSON] and ORG2 to help inform the public about the council adopted action plan to end homelessness."
10_12_2016,homeless; housing crisis,"what tools exist in the mayor's office, the homeless toolkit, the one point of contact, how they can get information about what's upcoming campsite cleanup efforts and opportunities to engage in other constructive community initiatives to end the housing crisis. So specifically, there will be one competitive grant for $80,000 that will go to one of [ORGANIZATION]'s existing partner organizations for [ORGANIZATION] and limited program support. and they will help coordinate our working relationship with ORG2 to work with the various advisory committees and help disseminate information to project partners and the general public."
10_12_2016,houseless,"Two, three... Two or three community organizations will be able to build their capacity for sharing information, leadership development, community engagement efforts, and public policy advocacy efforts. So there will be three competitive grants, each $80,000, that will help fund [ORGANIZATION] and limited program support, split evenly to organizations working for and with low-income tenants, the houseless, and communities of color, immigrants, and refugees."
10_12_2016,housing crisis; houseless,"But over [ORGANIZATION], working with community groups, working with those most impacted by the issue, they made it clear that there was an equal need to build capacity in communities most impacted by the crisis, low income tenants and the houseless to help them build their capacity to effectively advocate for themselves. And then lastly,  Why community engagement when some have asked why community engagement when maybe these funds should just go directly to building housing? We face a long-term systemic housing crisis and best public involvement practices for achieving racial equity necessitate engaging those most impacted."
10_12_2016,houseless,"The houseless and low-income tenants of which there is a disproportionate representation of people of color. And we just wanted to point out that city council adopted a racial equity goal.  that we will strengthen outreach, public engagement, and access to city services for communities of color and immigrant and refugee communities, and support or change existing services using racial equity best practices. And [ORGANIZATION] also adopted public involvement principles, which recognize ORG1 works best when community members and government work as partners."
10_12_2016,homeless,Thank you for having me here [TIME]. I'm here [ORGANIZATION] in my role as the Director of [ORGANIZATION]. I also have the role of Initiative Director for [ORGANIZATION].
10_12_2016,homeless; homelessness,"Over [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] has included ORG1 and ORG2 in conversations with its community partners to craft the proposal that you have before you. The result of that process is a proposal that I believe will strengthen the role of community members, in particular those who are experiencing the housing and homeless crisis most acutely, in shaping our response to the crisis generally and through ORG1 more specifically. Among the core commitments of [PERSON] and of ORG2 is that the policies and programs we implement to prevent and end homelessness should be shaped by those with personal experience of housing instability and homelessness."
10_12_2016,housing crisis,"That is why we've prioritized having people with lived experience on our coordinating board, our subcommittees, and why we have a [ORGANIZATION] forum that emphasizes soliciting the input of those who are living on our streets, in our shelters, and are using services in our system. The leadership development component of [ORGANIZATION]'s proposal promises to increase the number and diversity of people who are living the housing crisis DATE1, who have the tools they need to bring their perspectives to the various forums within ORG1, and to help us shape the best possible responses to the challenges that we face. Those tools will also be transferable to other local, state, and federal forums that also have to be part of any effective solution to our crisis."
10_12_2016,homelessness; housing crisis,"The component of this proposal that focuses on helping community groups work with their members to evaluate and develop policy proposals to respond to the housing and homelessness crisis also aligns well with a home for everyone. Specifically, our commitment to a community-based process for identifying the best possible local policies and strategies for preventing and ending homelessness. We hold [ORGANIZATION] meetings of work groups on safety off the streets, housing, health care, employment, and veterans' needs,  These meetings are where we look to the community members to come forward with their recommendations for policies and programs that would allow us to better meet the needs of people experiencing a housing crisis."
10_12_2016,homeless,"My hope is that the community-based policy work envisioned in this proposal will feed new ideas and strategies into these work groups and similar policy setting forums at the local and state level. And in turn, lead to new and effective responses to meet the needs of those who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless in our community. Finally, as I understand this proposal, it would create an important bridge between a home for everyone, the joint office, and neighborhood associations."
10_12_2016,homelessness,"We have had numerous stakeholders around the table at a home for everyone over [ORGANIZATION], but the role of the neighborhood associations has been relatively limited. That is a function, at least in part, of the fact that neighborhood associations were often not aware of the work happening within a home for everyone and how they could participate in that work. My hope and expectation is that the staff capacity envisioned here...  We'll help remedy that and increase the role of neighborhood associations in our work to end homelessness."
10_12_2016,homeless; homelessness; housing crisis,"Should you approve this proposal, [ORGANIZATION] looks forward to working with ORG1 to realize the potential of these funds to, one, strengthen the voices of people with lived experience of the housing crisis in our community's efforts to address homelessness. Two, to bring forward community-based policy innovation that will improve our response to the housing crisis. And three, to improve the community's understanding of the important work that is already happening through a home for everyone partners, including the city of [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]."
10_12_2016,housing crisis,"When we originally heard about the proposal coming forth out of [ORGANIZATION] and the community engagement process that was going to follow the award, we were really excited to know that the community had input in that. shaping this proposal and shaping how basically how we were going to address the housing crisis so I first want to say thank you so much for that opportunity and I'm really impressed with the [STREET] that community input was taken into consideration and molded into the proposal in a [STREET] that really facilitated what we believe at [ORGANIZATION] to be crucial in addressing the housing crisis which is community partners community-based organizations and the city partnering together to address our crisis and  I think, you know, to talk briefly about the concerns that were raised. regarding information sharing from the city to the community."
10_12_2016,housing crisis,And so knowing that this housing crisis is significantly huge and knowing that the capacity that currently... It's great to see that this proposal includes investment in that one. Oops.
10_12_2016,housing crisis,And we look forward to pushing forward in addressing this housing crisis. Thank you very much. Thank you.
10_12_2016,housing crisis; houseless,"And so what this proposal do, we give the people that live inside a chance to meet with the people that's outside and hear that all houseless people are not drug addicts, are not ladies of the night, are not gang bangers, but because of the housing crisis that's happening all over this country, that people are living on the streets.  111 people move here [ORGANIZATION]. So if 111 people move here [ORGANIZATION], 111 people are going to the streets [ORGANIZATION]. So in combining that,  And I like what [ORGANIZATION] is doing."
10_12_2016,houseless,"The neighbors are talking to the houseless community, seeing what they can do to better that neighborhood. And I think that's what needs to be done with this grant, with this proposal, that you need to combine and have real faces meet real people and say, hey, I'm houseless. but I'm not what you think I am."
10_12_2016,houseless,"So if you've got these successful houseless people outreaching and letting people know they're successful and what it took for them to get successful, I think, you know, I believe I know this will be a better city. Thank you. Questions for this great panel?"
10_12_2016,homeless,"uh... i just wanna say if you if you're not sure in case you might not be here then that uh...  This is a little tangential, but stick with me. DATE0, I was at [ORGANIZATION], and there were 150 people in the room, and they were advocates and homeless folks and architects and big thinkers about housing."
10_12_2016,homelessness,"We'll come up with strategies that even the biggest and most focused effort the city and the county have ever had on housing and homelessness will be improved effectively.  by the fact that those kinds of ideas and innovations will come to us. So it was just, you know, I believed in this before, but frankly being in that room with those folks is like, oh, yeah, this is going to work."
10_12_2016,homeless,"Okay. And at this point, we actually are already overextended in terms of our ongoing commitments because [ORGANIZATION] we're spending $11.5 million of ongoing money on homeless services, and we've made a commitment to spend $15 million a year on homeless services. So we're $3.5 million in the hole."
10_12_2016,housing crisis,"My first concern is how much of the $350,000 will be used to alleviate the sufferings of those most impacted by the housing crisis, versus how much will be spent on overhead among the participating agencies? Why is [ORGANIZATION] undertaking this, despite the city budget office analysis advising that there are already established outreach and public engagement efforts, primarily facilitated through ORG1? My second concern is, will the community engagement be meaningful, inclusive, and equitable?"
10_12_2016,unhoused,"I see no mention of neighbor engagement in the plan, yet the neighbors are the ones who will be expected to coexist peaceably and equitably. Neighbors are everyone who contribute to the fabric of the community. In [ORGANIZATION], our neighbors are housed and unhoused."
10_12_2016,unhoused,"The city chose to see the struggle of the diverse housed and the diverse unhoused as separate struggles. Policies seem to be directed at divide and conquer, where the diverse poor, working poor, and working class housed will pivot against the diverse poor and working poor unhoused to everyone's detriment. My third concern is, will the community be respectfully listened to and heard, or will the engagement remain lip service and participation remain tokenized?  [ORGANIZATION]'s experience [LOCATION] has been that, whether housed or unhoused, concerns were ignored or dismissed if they didn't match the city's agenda."
10_12_2016,unhoused,"No matter who protested, housed or unhoused, or about what, human rights, health, safety, safe space, quiet enjoyment, the message was clear. They don't really care about us. When a [ORGANIZATION] resident dared to suggest that wealthier neighborhoods should also bear the responsibility for caring for the unhoused, a city employee used a misogynistic, oppressive epithet to describe him on social media, and the city has yet to issue an apology."
10_12_2016,homeless,"This was exactly the case with me, but for my own life and the safety of my kids, I left all the same. Because I had to leave the home to escape him, I was immediately homeless and had no means of providing for us. The best solution available to me for the first problem was to seek out space in a shelter."
10_12_2016,homeless,"Thank you for having me here to share my story My name is [ORGANIZATION] and I work for [ORGANIZATION] a city contracted program as a relief coordinator for runaway and homeless youth and commercially sexually exploited children I have been in the position of relief coordinator for [ORGANIZATION] and I average over [TIME] a week and on dozens of occasions up to 60 to 70 [TIME] a week and  I receive my schedule via email, text, or call, and my [TIME] change DATE1 as I am on call DATE2 a week, 24 [TIME] a day."
10_12_2016,housing crisis,"I really appreciated that she's left, but I really appreciated [ORGANIZATION] raising the point about housing. Because we're in a housing crisis in this city. Our housing prices went up faster than any city in the country."
12_14_2016,homelessness,"And we actually did sign some joint letters to the new administration about housing and homelessness. and about climate. And so I think you're going to see that kind of concerted action among [ORGANIZATION] cities that are tolerant, inclusive places as we are."
12_14_2016,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] is working on an affordable housing green building policy, and a provision of that policy will be that the city investments for affordable housing, those projects will be [ORGANIZATION]-ready. Again, it means having the conduit and electrical capacity to be able to support charters. We're working with partners to –  provide used [ORGANIZATION] bulk buy programs where people can access used [ORGANIZATION]s, in which there's a big inventory of right now, and be able to get those cars at a discount."
12_14_2016,affordable housing,"We've recently announced a partnership with the city, [ORGANIZATION], who you'll hear from, and [ORGANIZATION] to test an electric vehicle sharing program for affordable housing. We look forward to the opportunity for these continued partnerships in this area and an overall focus on making electric transportation available to all. We're pleased to express our support for the city's [ORGANIZATION] strategy."
12_14_2016,homeless,What's the difference? I would like to know that. That fire was in a homeless camp.  which is really vulnerable.
12_14_2016,homeless,"There are ways to put these fires out and prevent them from causing damage to the whole property, such as at this homeless camp. What would have happened if they had some good fire extinguishers in that camp that they were provided from the city, and they would have had those in the tents or on that property? I can assure you this fire wouldn't have gotten out of control the [STREET] it did."
12_14_2016,homeless,I was on a property...  while back where we had to have ten of them and have inspectors come out and inspect on a regular basis that was required from the [INSTITUTION] into past inspections we need to focus on that to prevent these fires from getting out of control especially in warehouses or nightclubs and of course any type of homeless camps thank you thank you very much all right
12_14_2016,affordable housing,"[DATE], provide affordable housing through an inclusionary housing program. And [DATE], provide affordable housing through an inclusionary program and update the multiple unit limited tax exemption program. Okay."
12_14_2016,affordable housing,"It came from someone smarter than me. But the first cousin is the struggles we've had in the past when we've talked about putting new transportation lines in different parts of the city, and how do we create incentives for affordable housing? And one of the tools that we don't have available to us is downzoning in anticipation of then upzoning to give someone the benefit."
12_14_2016,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], because of their strong climate agenda, is also thinking about person trips and has invested in a number of studies, some of which  I'm involved in around affordable housing and transportation impacts and also relates to some of the discussions that you all have entertained [TIME]. And then our research here at [ORGANIZATION]. So [ORGANIZATION] has funded a number of studies, some of which the work that I've done here in [PERSON], but also in other places looking at these issues."
12_14_2016,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] and [LOCATION], right? Yes. Could you read those two together?  [ORGANIZATION], authorize financing not expected to exceed $51 million for an affordable housing project known as [ORGANIZATION]."
12_14_2016,affordable housing,"These 263 units of affordable housing on 11 acres of property in relatively inner northeast [ORGANIZATION], it will prevent displacement of the residents, and it will also assure for the long term we have affordable apartments in this particular parcel, and I think it's a great buy. Thank you. And, as Commissioner [PERSON] said, we won't actually expend bond money until much later, so there is time to get the oversight committee up and running, the bond oversight committee up and running, and to get their input on this decision."
12_14_2016,homeless; homelessness; unhoused,"Well, you know, when we declared a state of housing emergency [ORGANIZATION], this is the kind of thing we hoped for. And thanks to your leadership, Commissioner [PERSON], here we are in [LOCATION] having been recognized for accomplishing the goal of being the first [ORGANIZATION] city to end veterans' homelessness on a numerical basis. Of course, there are more homeless veterans all the time, but we're housing them faster than they're becoming unhoused."
12_14_2016,affordable housing,"So I appreciate the council's willingness to set aside that issue about what can happen in residential zones and what cannot. And looking at the whole buffer thing, thank you for bringing that up. Another consideration is if we are encouraging more commercial enterprises in residential zones, does that further put pressure on affordable housing that some units might be able to pay more than others?"
11_05_2015,affordable housing,"This is a story about growth management and the story about the continuation of the success of [ORGANIZATION], the creation of a new neighborhood in what was once a railroad shipping and switching yard. It's a story of an urban neighborhood that fits changing urban demographics, and now we can shape it further to fit the demographics and housing needs of [ORGANIZATION]. It's a story of about 1,[ADDRESS], a story about transit investments that have reduced our carbon footprint and made us a more livable city."
11_05_2015,affordable housing,"But more than that, we have the opportunity to express our values around affordable housing, around open space, around density, and around connectivity, around finally making connections between these vital elements to our central city, which include the downtown, [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], and  LOC2 and and and union station right now these are in somewhat some respect disconnected because of the existence of of the post office and each of those areas is now has these crucial moments in time where with this these added connectivity they can actually achieve their fullest potential so um uh this is this is definitely exciting time and so i hope we all we all we all think about the magnitude of it um  What's happening [ORGANIZATION] is we have this high-level framework plan that [ORGANIZATION] will walk you through really to kind of create the context for the decisions that both [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] will make."
11_05_2015,affordable housing,"So, again, what we heard, we heard questions around the financial risk, around making sure that the affordable housing target aligned with [ORGANIZATION] goals. And you'll see we did a lot of work with [ORGANIZATION] as follow-up to that. And then making sure as we thought about next steps for the project, that we thought about other public improvements like the park in front of the [ORGANIZATION] campus,  the plaza in front of [ORGANIZATION], et cetera, making sure that those are kind of  as we enter into a master plan scope."
11_05_2015,affordable housing,"for the [ADDRESS] two blocks of the [ORGANIZATION] blocks that's kind of sitting north of the ORG1 block and really thinking intentionally about the green loop  the framework plan does model the financials just to test the feasibility in terms of affordable housing of reserving 25 percent of all of the residential floor area ratio that we modeled as building for residential use for affordable housing we then following on our discussion with ORG2 worked with ORG3 to identify how we could get to 30 percent and that's what came before ORG2 DATE0 as part of the set aside policy package update And then the last but not least, it does include a recommendation or a model development at a higher entitlement, what we would call a higher entitlement, than currently sits on the books. So it does model development at 7 to 1 FAR."
11_05_2015,affordable housing,"The financial analysis recommendations both recommended kind of starting with residential and then having the commercial or the new commercial come in on the back end, but also coordinating infrastructure and development so that we're not getting ahead of the game in terms of our infrastructure investments as a city. So just to go over a little bit in terms of the affordable housing approach, we heard a lot from council as well as [ORGANIZATION] about ORG1 working with ORG2 to make sure that we were targeting the 30% figure that is the goal of the [PERSON] plan. And so what came before council DATE0 as part of the DATE1 set-aside policy recommendations was for [ORGANIZATION] to allocate $20 million –  towards affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION] urban renewal area, with a significant portion of that serving to acquire rights...  for [ORGANIZATION] to acquire rights within the development of the postal site."
11_05_2015,affordable housing,"for [ORGANIZATION] to develop affordable housing. And then there was also kind of a commitment that [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] would work jointly as we move forward with the master plan and the development solicitations on the site. This slide reviews assuming that $13 million of the site is acquired by [ORGANIZATION], what are the remaining resources that would be available?  via land sales to [ORGANIZATION] together with tax increment financing that we've proposed being needed for demolition and site preparation."
11_05_2015,affordable housing,"the post office both around site due diligence and around negotiating an acquisition agreement that would then result in them actually continuing to design a replacement facility and moving into more formalized design and construction which would take [ORGANIZATION] concurrently we will continue to work with our city bureau partners around the central city [LOCATION]  um goals and objectives and language that comes back before you in DATE2 particularly around the master plan requirement that's contemplated in the west quadrant component of the central city [LOCATION] plan or as well as around any entitlement changes  And then a development solicitation and agreement to kind of go out to the private sector, really get our private partner on board, come back to you with a master plan, particularly if there's public investment contemplated both via the affordable housing as well as via the infrastructure. With the goal of having kind of the first sale complete and construction underway in [LOCATION], that aligns back with our phasing strategy that we had in the framework plan. So with that, I'm going to stop and welcome any questions."
11_05_2015,affordable housing,"A new plaza at FAC0 will be energized with both social and commercial activities from these folks. So the scale of development envisaged at the post office site will create a new and substantial focus for employment and housing, including affordable housing. This will be de facto transit-oriented development, advancing the city's goals of reduced dependence on automobile travel, reducing atmospheric carbon, and increasing walkability throughout the central city."
11_05_2015,affordable housing,"We don't get a lot of do-overs at the city, and this is a unique opportunity for [ORGANIZATION], learning from the FAC0, FAC1, the [ORGANIZATION] developments. This provides, and also the...  potential density bonus maximize and affordable units it's it's a very exciting opportunity we are very thankful and appreciative of being part of this discussion um the broadway corridor framework is consistent with the central city plan the [DATE] plan in terms of the 30 percent of all units we made available for families at zero to eighty percent median family income um  Through the tips we said that was approved [ORGANIZATION], an additional $20 million was allocated to the [ORGANIZATION] for this investment or investments of affordable housing in the area, and the [ORGANIZATION] has gone through an analysis to the best [STREET] that it will invest those resources in order to maximize units and diversity within this framework. So we're very appreciative of that."
11_05_2015,affordable housing,"For the record, my name is [ORGANIZATION]. I'm with [ORGANIZATION]. We're a statewide association of affordable housing nonprofits, about 20 members here in the [ORGANIZATION] area."
11_05_2015,affordable housing,"and i had the pleasure of serving on the stakeholder advisory committee really appreciated um having a [STREET] at that table and the robust conversations we had staff did a great job running a quick time frame but very rich discussion and lots of great folks on the committee so obviously from the housing affordable housing community perspective we're very excited to see this commitment up front and this intentional planning as part of this really exciting massive opportunity  I'd really also like the collaboration that we're seeing between [ORGANIZATION] and ORG1 directors and staff. That's something we'd love to see going forward, as well as transparency around not just the dollar amounts but the units, the number of units, who they'll serve, as Commissioner [PERSON] was highlighting a moment ago, and what the plan is. We know, certainly – and I appreciate PERSON1 mentioning this just now – that this is  This is in some ways a do-over to what we saw, as you recall, when the late, great PERSON2, may she rest in peace, came here."
11_05_2015,affordable housing,"It was really to talk about...  what the missed opportunity in [ORGANIZATION] around affordable housing. So I'm excited to see this upfront commitment and that we're going to certainly be involved in watching this as it goes to make sure that those commitments, those early commitments hold fast and that we really before the land values get out of control that we can lock those in and look at not just at the post office site but there are the surrounding sites, those currently owned by [ORGANIZATION] and those in private hands. Thank you."
11_05_2015,homelessness,"So, again, really appreciate this commitment. We want to – one of the issues I raised, though, in the committee was just in terms of the number – huge numbers of folks currently experiencing homelessness in this entire study area, development area. So obviously we're going to want to look at avoiding displacement, figuring out how the opportunity for housing and services will be a part of this going forward for those folks."
11_05_2015,affordable housing,"We had four working sessions within that group, and there was a broad range of interests and expertise a part of it. [ORGANIZATION], adjacent property owners, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION],  numerous experienced developers, affordable housing interests, as well as adjacent neighborhood associations. It was well-informed, as [ORGANIZATION] said."
11_05_2015,affordable housing,i'm happy to answer any questions well i guess uh since you mentioned institutional investors [ORGANIZATION] i guess i just wanted to ask you i feel that a lot of the institutional investors from out of state have no interest in doing affordable housing that's been my experience and  to date with the vast majority of ones I've had outreach with. So what do we do to change that?
11_05_2015,affordable housing,"But where it's our property, surely we can require that. You know, you don't get to develop here unless, and I would suggest maybe you don't even get to develop here unless you're going to do some affordable housing somewhere else as well, or at least do a mixed use or a mixed income level. Yeah, no, I think, you know, I think the policies we passed [ORGANIZATION], you know, certainly create that floor."
11_05_2015,affordable housing,"And when a number of the developers were interviewed recently in a newspaper article, they cited generally red tape and bureaucracy as the impediments to using that program. The irony is you just mentioned a program in [ORGANIZATION] where they are mandated to provide affordable housing. It's not an incentive plan."
11_05_2015,affordable housing,"So what would it take to get the development community, in your judgment, to join the city in seeking a lifting of the preemption on inclusionary zoning so we can mandate out-of-state developers to do the right thing? First off, I'd say that my expertise as a commercial real estate broker is in office. So asking me about residential unit  in particular affordable housing, which is very complex and typically takes subsidizing, is probably not my Arab expertise."
11_05_2015,affordable housing,"It ought to be our jobs. as for the affordable housing i would be a big advocate of putting that on the private sector and i would look for outcomes from that and i'd love to see it mixed in with the balance of the project as opposed to taking a block for affordable housing and five blocks for private sector work as for the value uh based on what i've been uh the information has been shared with me based upon what i understand that the zoning is uh contemplated to be put on this i think after [ORGANIZATION] and the city does their work with entitlements in [STREET]  assuming it's the FAR that comes off the streets and parks, goes onto the developable land, assuming that we take this to market in a very competitive, brokered fashion to get the highest value possible, and net of the public improvements, including affordable housing, so straight market rate stuff, my estimate after the work is done that this on the low end is going to be worth $135 million worth of dirt, and on the high end $177 million worth of dirt."
11_05_2015,homeless; affordable housing,"[STREET] warriors um you know the the homeless certainly that's an issue drugs and alcohol are an issue chronic homeless people are an issue but the big issue is the vagrancy and the young toughs so um  When you just attached a value, I think you said $130 to $135 million. You said net of affordable housing."
11_05_2015,affordable housing,"So, [ORGANIZATION], with the action we took recently kicking –  urban renewal, the percentage of urban renewal money for affordable housing of 45%. Some have argued that's hastening the demise of [ORGANIZATION] as an economic development agency because we're choking off some resources that they need to do their job. Well, we all agree that if [ORGANIZATION]s can be successful in the long term, we have to find a new model for them to generate revenue."
11_05_2015,affordable housing,"I think it's just some of the [STREET] we do business around here. So the First Amendment to the resolution simply reflects [ORGANIZATION] goal that we agreed on [ORGANIZATION] and has been said here is already,  Part of the purpose there of that is to have 30% of the housing be affordable to 0% to 80% median family income, and that's the amendment to the resolution. And then the amendment to the [ORGANIZATION] really just adds language that reflects the memo that was developed between [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], which I have here as well,  and would include that memo as an attachment to make for a compact legislative history, and just simply says that [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] will fulfill all their obligations with respect to affordable housing, as agreed to by council in [LOCATION]."
11_05_2015,affordable housing,"but i think as we heard i think we all agree we want to see sort of some mixed income development here so i think this really speaks aspirationally to you know we also want to include if we can through private resources or through our multi-program uh units that serve that 60 to 80 percent as well  I support the central city goal, and I share the point that you made and [ORGANIZATION] made about mixed income development, because sometimes that's the strongest development, where we blend the deeply affordable housing with middle-income housing, and everyone wins. The only thing I – and I guess I'm a little gun-shy because of FAC0."
11_05_2015,affordable housing,"I don't want this to be interpreted as saying that –  that somehow we don't invest the first dollar into where the greatest need is. And the first dollars and the money that we're generating in this area, if we adopt the resolution before us,  will be set aside money for deeply affordable housing. So I might want to ask [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] and PERSON2, if they're still here, to come up and respond to this about how this would be administered if we adopt these amendments."
11_05_2015,affordable housing,"And the [ORGANIZATION] has done a comprehensive analysis of this and said that he's satisfied that this financing mechanism is prudent. And the third is that –  we have a chance in this development to make another significant contribution towards affordable housing and do it the right [STREET], which is at the front end with binding commitments, learning from our experience in [ORGANIZATION]. So for those reasons, and then just an extra credit one for me, is that if we are serious about [ORGANIZATION] moving beyond [ORGANIZATION] as a funding source, and if we want [ORGANIZATION] to play a long-term role in economic development,  we are going to have to develop a new model for them to be successful."
11_05_2015,affordable housing,"But I don't think we really had sort of the economic engine to really see something happen or the vacancy rates, both residential and commercial, being at historic lows that just tell us that development is primed. And particularly on the affordable housing, when we can prime the pumps with further commitment of public resources to do that. So I really do think it's a question of having the right leadership and being in the right time and the right [STREET]."
09_27_2017,homeless,"And more recently, we were on the front lines of the homeless crisis. We're out there dealing with the people living in their RVs, knocking on doors, giving them the social services and assistance they need. We're one of several classifications requesting a selective increase."
09_27_2017,homeless,I do agree. But this is a totally different type of a situation here to where we need funding at the city. The mayor's talking about maybe having to not fund homeless projects at the full amount anymore.
09_27_2017,homeless,We provide shelter for people that have homeless families. And then we have the Big P policy at the top where you all do your due diligence work with Big P policy. But there's this vast world just below Big P policy and just above traditional direct service.
09_27_2017,housing insecurity,"It's DATE0 for them when they arrive at school. But there's conditions, there's factors, whether it's housing insecurity, food insecurity, domestic violence, drug abuse, all of that. So we're really going below the iceberg to work with our community partners to provide more mental health supports in that conversation."
09_27_2017,affordable housing,"the city of [ORGANIZATION], the [ORGANIZATION] ORG0, and the state of [PERSON], how much their activity, their corporate responsibility is towards those local communities, what the dollar lending portfolio looks like in affordable housing, what it looks like to deal with the offer services for the unbanked population, et cetera,  I will be asking a question, heads up, everyone who's listening from the banking world about foreclosure activity. As you know, the city has more actively pursued foreclosures for outstanding city liens, and there have been banks who have had nexuses to properties on the city's foreclosure list. I'll be asking about that."
09_27_2017,affordable housing,"[DATE], and 75.  [ADDRESS] and [DATE]  Approve application under multiple unit limited tax exemption program FAC0, located at [ADDRESS]. Colleagues, these three multiple unit limited tax exemption, better known as multi-applications are for developments which are complying with the inclusionary housing program that went in [ORGANIZATION]. These are the first three permits to go through the inclusionary housing process, aside from a handful of affordable housing projects which are receiving direct funding from [ORGANIZATION]."
09_27_2017,affordable housing,"The projects, 54 [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and 60 12 [ORGANIZATION], are all providing affordable units for [ORGANIZATION] as part of the inclusionary housing program, having elected to provide units in their new developments that will be affordable to households earning up to 60 or 80 percent of area median income rather than paying the fee in lieu. The multi-program is one of the financial incentives provided to inclusionary housing projects providing affordable units. In addition to exemption of the affordable housing construction excise tax and for projects providing units affordable at 60% of area median income or below, exemption of the system development charges."
09_27_2017,affordable housing,"It kind of comes in drips and dribbles to the city council. And when I see 22 units, and I know that the building, the affordable housing building that I live in, has a waiting list with 350 people on it, and that other buildings aren't even taking waiting lists, and I know this is going to be [ORGANIZATION] before they come to fruition. it's kind of hard to get the big picture of, you know, are we – is it water and a balloon, you know, that we're dealing with, or what kind of progress are we making?"
09_27_2017,homeless,"So kind of what I'd like to ask, especially since Mr. [PERSON] is here [ORGANIZATION], is if a report could come to city council that would sort of be an overview. You know, in [LOCATION] there have been a number of citizens who have come and they've accused you of not using the money that's been allocated for housing and not doing anything about the homeless issue and, you know, where's the money going, how have you spent it, blah, blah, blah. And I can understand that because I think as a private citizen about the only [STREET] that we have to measure what progress is being made is by what we see on the streets and in the neighborhoods all over the city."
09_27_2017,homeless,"You know, this is what we've identified. This is the number of homeless. These are the different categories of homeless people."
09_27_2017,homelessness,"But what I think is asking a lot, and I love that housing report. I mean, I actually have a signed copy from [ORGANIZATION] on my desk, is, you know, if you have an evening and you dig into it, there's a wealth of information. But I think in [ORGANIZATION], a dashboard with a few graphs and a running tally, I think that's what [PERSON]'s saying, so that she can say, look, homelessness is down a little bit or more people in shelter beds or here's the problem, we're meeting this need."
09_27_2017,affordable housing,"And that the softening of the market has something to do with our [ORGANIZATION] policy when we know that perhaps the overbuilding at the market and luxury rate level has a little more to do with the softening of the market. And the fact is,  that many developers are not building to the demand that exists here. And the demand is for affordable housing for people who earn less than 120% of MFI or less than 100."
12_12_2018,homelessness,"I'm here to talk to you about [ORGANIZATION]. I have spoke with from homelessness to tenants of [ORGANIZATION]. As you probably know, [ORGANIZATION] at one time was [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION] and of [PERSON]."
12_12_2018,homeless,And why does [ORGANIZATION] have property management run property that they have and they don't communicate with each other? I myself is now homeless with four cats and social security disability who has a broken foot for [ORGANIZATION] who needs surgery.
12_12_2018,homeless,"I am homeless because they evicted my housemate. I went to them for housing, and all they care is, sorry, we can't help you. They have no respect or dignity for us."
12_12_2018,homeless,"And we, the homeless, come to apply for a [STREET], not shun us and just give us respect and listen. Thank you. Thank you."
12_12_2018,homeless,"Access to clean water is obviously important, and I'm happy to hear that the mayor and the commission are considering this authorization process. Since I've been homeless in [ORGANIZATION], one thing that I've learned is that it is hard to find a [STREET] to pee and it's hard to find a [STREET] to take a shower."
12_12_2018,homeless; homelessness,"Since clean water is a public good, it shouldn't, pardon me, access to clean water shouldn't just be limited to those with homes. There need to be more facilities in this city for homeless people to pee and for homeless people to take a shower. [PERSON] should be a protected class."
12_12_2018,homeless,"We would do this in the mornings to stay warm, to try to dry off. [TIME] in [ORGANIZATION], there are thousands of homeless people looking for dry socks. It's shameful that in a city, in a region home to [ORGANIZATION]..."
12_12_2018,homeless,"It is shameful that in a city that houses these apparel makers, we can't ensure that there are clean, dry socks for every homeless person DATE0 that it rains. Thank you, Commissioner. We all agree with you on that, but we're talking about something else."
12_12_2018,affordable housing,"So they've sold their underlying fee interest to [ORGANIZATION]. In preparation for the project that [ORGANIZATION] is going to be building, an affordable housing project, so [ORGANIZATION] will be selling their property to [ORGANIZATION]. Most likely it's anticipated in [ORGANIZATION]."
12_12_2018,homeless,"Okay. There are individuals here from the following organizations, if anybody has any questions. There is an individual from [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], who is a consultant for ORG2, also the executive director of ORG2 is here, [PERSON], [LOCATION], and [ORGANIZATION]."
12_12_2018,homelessness,"Number three, maintaining healthy facilities to enhance the existing facilities like [ORGANIZATION], keeping them vital and competitive. And number four, community livability and safety to improve conditions for the community and people experiencing homelessness, improve the visitor experience, and help [ORGANIZATION] remain a desirable destination. The agreement we're hearing [ORGANIZATION], while not perfect in every respect, meets and balances those goals very, very well."
12_12_2018,homelessness,I want to focus a bit more about how this agreement helps us address homelessness in particular. [ORGANIZATION] is an attractive destination. Those of us who live here love it.
12_12_2018,homeless; homelessness,"At the same time that we're attracting visitors by the hundreds of thousands, too many are suffering on our streets without a home, many of them experiencing addiction or mental health or economic challenges. The best solution for homelessness is housing. And the best solution for those who are chronically homeless is to pair that housing with support services."
12_12_2018,homeless,"This division of responsibility can lead to important partnerships and good results. Recently, the city partnered with [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION] on a supportive housing pilot to better connect housing and services. The deal on ORG1 we're hearing [ORGANIZATION] is another good partnership."
12_12_2018,homeless,"Local governments and tourism industry and the tourism industry will devote nearly $60 million from the [ORGANIZATION] account to [ORGANIZATION] over [ORGANIZATION]. But that level of funding for support services is still not enough to meet our goal of 2,000 supportive units over [ORGANIZATION]. We heard a report in [LOCATION] that suggested services could be as high as $40 million DATE2."
12_12_2018,homeless; homelessness,"The letter of agreement focused on the four priorities that the Mayor mentioned, and those have consistently framed the discussion. I'm going to use those as a framework for talking about the specific details. So, first of all, consistent with the community livability and safety priority, there are two allocations in this agreement that are dedicated to new funding for the provision of services and programs for people experiencing homelessness or who are at risk of becoming homeless and to address community livability and safety concerns associated with homelessness."
12_12_2018,homelessness,"Now to get to the goal number that the mayor has repeated to us for the total amount going to homelessness, we added a second allocation, which is called the additional livability and support amount. And it is done as a difference between a set number and the base allocation. So beginning [ORGANIZATION], the first additional allocation will be the difference between the base allocation and $2.5 million, which is about $680,000."
12_12_2018,homelessness,"So over time, if we come up with a different system of addressing homelessness, this allocation would go to a successor. Thank you. Obviously...  My own preference is that the bulk of the dollars go to fund the services on supportive housing, but that is ultimately a decision to be made by the joint office and other governing bodies."
12_12_2018,homeless,"One of the ten points of our recently completed Tourism Master Plan was for us to be actively engaged in making a difference in vulnerable communities. The county must use those additive funds to make a visible difference for those living in crisis on the streets of [ORGANIZATION]. And as you are a partner in a joint office of homeless services, we will work with you to monitor that success on the industry's behalf."
12_12_2018,homelessness,"The first is I just got back from [ORGANIZATION], a particularly beautiful part of [ORGANIZATION] just outside of [PERSON]. I was struck by the level of [STREET] homelessness that I encountered in the downtown shopping district and the [STREET] the community adapted to that. Okay."
12_12_2018,homeless,"DATE0, I was in [ORGANIZATION] and learned they have [DATE] times the per capita homeless challenge that we face. And, of course...  recently in [PERSON] to watch my daughter run the marathon. And [PERSON] is a harsher city than our city because of the [STREET] the [STREET] grid is laid out and the kind of downtown structures."
12_12_2018,homeless,"So the homeless situation seems harsher, frankly. So you are no doubt hearing from peer cities and from your counterparts in other cities. What are we not doing enough of to address this challenge?"
12_12_2018,homeless,"You know, I think this begins to make investments in those supportive services, but I will tell you that it's important that we separate the need to take care of our homeless population and how we address bad [STREET] behavior, as we like to call it. They're two very different things. And having supportive  support services and services actually on the [STREET]."
12_12_2018,homelessness,And I'm really pleased also to see that. the support for housing and homelessness. It's really time for [ORGANIZATION] to do this.
12_12_2018,homelessness,"Really now more than ever that we have hundreds if not thousands of homes and units taken out of our rental inventory and put into the short-term rental market. And we hear complaints and concerns from constituents and out-of-towners about the impact our homelessness crisis has on tourism and our local economy. There's a direct correlation, direct and undeniable correlation between affordability and tourism.  and homelessness."
12_12_2018,affordable housing,"between 1.7% and 3.3% from [ORGANIZATION]. Manufactured dwelling parks play a small but important part in providing affordable housing, and the incentives to promote this housing type should be available immediately. I don't know, Commissioner [PERSON], if you have some opening remarks for anybody else."
12_12_2018,homelessness,"Very good. So, Commissioners, the city has been approached by [ORGANIZATION], Director of [ORGANIZATION], a provider of transitional housing for families experiencing homelessness. [ORGANIZATION] has a half-acre site near [ORGANIZATION] and FAC0 that they'd like to rezone to manufactured dwelling park in order to provide additional housing and services for families in need."
12_12_2018,homelessness,The idea being that they receive subsidies in order to stay in these units until they're on their feet again. And what I would stress and what was stressed to me is that  These are families on the edge of homelessness. So these are not folks that have any ability to go out and find other market rate housing.
12_12_2018,homelessness; affordable housing,"So of all the agencies I've worked at, the biggest barrier to success for families is housing. So at [ORGANIZATION], we provide transitional housing and service coordination so that families can obtain the resources needed to be sustainable over a longer period of time. While there's a growing effort to create more affordable housing, families are in need of  support to address the trauma of homelessness, really."
12_12_2018,homelessness,So having that support while accessing resources and having a safe [STREET] to live is all within the best interest of the family. Our transitional housing also allows tenants to build skills in terms of following the guidelines of a lease and paying rent. A lot of our families come from homelessness.
12_12_2018,affordable housing,"This was how we planned our cities, and this is the case around the country. So I think many [ORGANIZATION] would be surprised to learn that we have 3,000 mobile home spaces in the city, which constitutes housing for several thousand residents, I'm going to guess. While it's an affordable housing option, it's fraught with challenges, especially when residents are forced to move."
12_12_2018,homeless,"Okay. Gosh, you know, I had never been homeless before moving to [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]. And while this, in many senses, is a great city to be homeless in because there are a number of world-class services available to homeless people, it is nevertheless a challenge to be homeless anywhere, I imagine."
12_12_2018,homelessness,"Okay. When I say that homelessness should be a protected class, what I think of is the many times that I've been arrested by [ORGANIZATION] for trespassing only to have the charges dropped [ORGANIZATION]. That happened to me [TIME], actually."
12_12_2018,homeless,"I still need to go out to the property and evidence warehouse to pick up evidence. the property that was taken from me during that arrest. In fact, the majority of arrests made in this county are of people that are homeless, even though the homeless population of this county is only 3%."
12_12_2018,homeless,"That reminds me of [ORGANIZATION]-era [ORGANIZATION], and [PERSON] deserves better. Mayor, why do we arrest so many homeless people? So I've been very patient."
12_12_2018,homeless,"We're talking about the inclusionary housing extension. Why does the city arrest so many homeless people, Mayor? That is not what we are here to discuss."
12_12_2018,affordable housing,"It's just great to hear from a developer who embraces inclusionary housing. I think some developers see it as a penalty or an impediment, and we have an obligation to,  to make sure that there is adequate affordable housing that meets our actual demand. And developers benefit from all the public dollars that we invest in our city, in infrastructure, parks, whatever."
12_12_2018,housing crisis,"PERSON0. Hi.  Inclusionary housing is a new tool that we have in addressing our city's housing crisis and fostering diverse neighborhoods now and for the future. Okay, we've got an issue here."
12_12_2018,affordable housing,"We'll take a recess. We're back in session. By linking the development of affordable housing to market rate housing, this program ensures that as [ORGANIZATION] grows, people of all income levels will have the opportunity to live and thrive here."
12_19_2018,homelessness; affordable housing,"Leading with the affordable housing, addressing homelessness, and investing in mental health and addiction services. Also included in the city's priorities for [ORGANIZATION] are ensuring the protection of immigrants, providing for resiliency, continuing the [ORGANIZATION] cleanup, supporting federal investment in transportation infrastructure, and addressing climate change. There were a small number of changes to the agenda following our work session."
12_19_2018,affordable housing,"In the priority section, there were edits to the providing affordable housing item to include a specific reference to [ORGANIZATION] waivers. In the policy position section, there were two changes. We added a policy position that was titled [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] to assist [PERSON] in identifying potential federal funding opportunities for systems and facility enhancements."
12_19_2018,affordable housing,"Really happy to be working with [ORGANIZATION] as well. Dr. [PERSON]'s done a great job on mental health care services. That also is a high priority across the state, as is affordable housing, that everybody is really struggling with houselessness and how to help."
12_19_2018,homelessness,"And all of us believe quite strongly that this is going to impact our work on homelessness and housing issues. And we want to continue to support additional investments in mental health and addiction services. As I just mentioned, we're eager to stand as a strong partner in addressing environmental issues and carbon emissions and air toxics."
12_19_2018,homeless,"This was prepared by the three principals in these conversations, the President of [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] from [ORGANIZATION], and myself, the Mayor of [PERSON], on what is the ORG1. Quote,  We had a substantive and productive discussion, this was just on [ORGANIZATION], about how ORG2 account can deliver improvements across our community. We agreed on the tremendous opportunity before us to make an investment in homeless services and also to modernize our visitor facilities."
12_19_2018,homeless,"And he has been in the mall [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION], and DATE2 of [ORGANIZATION]. And that's one. [PERSON], our surveillance picked up a large group of youths at FAC0 who encircled an individual who appeared homeless."
12_19_2018,homeless; houseless,And we participated in a news conference [ORGANIZATION] that was headed up by the people working on a homeless bill of rights. And it was about business improvement districts and how they create their own kind of mini fiefdoms and create laws that are exclusionary and generally focused on people who are houseless. I was glad to hear the only mention of houselessness in that presentation was really about the unfortunate houseless person who seemed to have been attacked by people.
12_19_2018,homeless,"However, since [ORGANIZATION], it's been lacking. And...  With the people who are currently out of [STREET], who are homeless and don't have places to go, FAC0 is a desirable [STREET] for a lot of reasons. It's close to public transportation."
12_19_2018,houseless,"I second what the woman who testified earlier was saying. I am in favor of them using their money to help our houseless population survive out on the streets, preferably inside. And if they need more cops over there, give them G4S from here because they're useless."
12_19_2018,homeless,"And colleagues, we will have presentations DATE0 from [ORGANIZATION] from my office, [PERSON], and [LOCATION]. [LOCATION] is, of course, the Director of [ORGANIZATION] between [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]. After they give their presentations, we'll have some invited testimony from [ORGANIZATION]."
12_19_2018,housing crisis,"Waiving [ORGANIZATION] fees is one tool [ORGANIZATION] has available to address our housing crisis and need for shelter access. I would now like to pass this off to [ORGANIZATION], and thank you for hearing us DATE0. Hello, I'm [PERSON]"
12_19_2018,homeless,"Uh, what the proposal is, is SDCs would be waived for mass shelters and short-term housing projects. Um, with, and the should say, uh,  With confirmation from [ORGANIZATION]. Can we go back for a second?"
12_19_2018,affordable housing,"And then there's [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], which also could come in with permits and request those fees to be waived as well. The ordinance proposal is to amend Title 30 to create a new section for [ORGANIZATION] waivers for mass shelters and short-term housing. It would amend Title 30 as well to remove the current references for mass shelters waivers  from the section that it's currently in, which is waivers for affordable housing."
12_19_2018,homeless,"Commissioners, my name is [ORGANIZATION] and I'm the director of [ORGANIZATION]. I'm here [ORGANIZATION] to express my appreciation for the ORG1 waiver measure you are voting on [ORGANIZATION]. I want to thank ORG2 for initiating this effort and for the partnership with the ORG1 bureaus and [ORGANIZATION]."
12_19_2018,homelessness,"In fact, as we have moved to create shelters, the public interest in advancing those projects has been strong enough that the [ORGANIZATION] bureaus have often ultimately granted waivers of the fees.  but seeking waivers from each [ORGANIZATION] bureau for each project is a time-consuming staff and resource-intensive process that often slows projects down. This proposal eliminates that complexity and will allow shelters to be created more quickly. The proposal before you will be one more important tool in our efforts to address the crisis of unsheltered homelessness in our community, and ORG1 welcomes the opportunity to play a role in the implementation of this new tool."
12_19_2018,homeless; homelessness,"Good morning. I'm [PERSON], the Director of [ORGANIZATION] at [ORGANIZATION]. As you may know, we operate a variety of services for people who are experiencing homelessness or for people who have left homelessness, including [ORGANIZATION]."
12_19_2018,homelessness,"I know that you, Mayor [PERSON], were visiting [ORGANIZATION], and at that time we let you know that 18 women had moved into permanent housing, but as of [LOCATION], 20 women from the village have left long-term chronic homelessness and moved into permanent housing. So we're very pleased about that. At [ORGANIZATION], we believe very strongly that small alternative shelters are a very good model for people who are not successful in larger shelters."
12_19_2018,homelessness,"The sense of security and privacy that women have at the village, as well as long-term intensive case management, has really proved to be a key for folks to move on out of homelessness. People have secured jobs, started small businesses, left domestic violence relationships.  and sought recovery from addiction and mental health disorders through their work at the village. We at [ORGANIZATION] are actively pursuing additional alternative shelters like FAC0 and ORG1, but we believe that the system development charges are prohibitive, and applying for individual waivers really impedes our ability to be nimble and flexible and to start new sites."
12_19_2018,homeless,"I'm [PERSON], Senior Director of Programs with [ORGANIZATION]. Thanks for bringing this important change forward. Over [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] has opened 13 shelters in 13 different locations, including permanent, [LOCATION], and temporary shelters, all with the support of this council and [ORGANIZATION]."
12_19_2018,homeless,"If you notice, there's been – there's homeless all over the [STREET]. Yes. We've even had homeless protests outside where an individual got assaulted and robbed and was brought into FAC0 for first aid just to be kicked out by security because the person was not injured on FAC0 property."
12_19_2018,homeless,"And then when the police decided to deal with it, which was over [TIME], the guy that was pepper sprayed actually had to walk four blocks to,  speak with the police, which I thought was totally disgusting. Um, and, uh,  Also, [ORGANIZATION], they had a protest out back by your car in which a number of homeless protesters – Mr. [PERSON], is this testimony going to focus on the matter at hand, which is the [ORGANIZATION] for the shelters? It is."
12_19_2018,homeless,Homeless protesters were shoved by your G4S security guards. Okay. We need more shelters.
12_19_2018,homeless,"We need more places where homeless can go. We don't need the homeless ticketed. There's a homeless dude that was out in front of FAC0 that got a citation, a criminal citation, for camping in front of FAC0."
12_19_2018,homeless,"But if we didn't waive the fee, it's really just moving money from... Because...  it's not like they're collecting rent from these homeless people. Any [ORGANIZATION] money, where did it come from?"
12_19_2018,homeless,"From [ORGANIZATION] or [ORGANIZATION]. Now there we maybe do have a private funder. But anyway, vote yes to delay these ORG2 fees."
12_19_2018,homeless; homelessness,"Hi.  I've been homeless in [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION] now, [LOCATION]. And I understand that shelters are an important part of a solution, not just to the problem of homelessness, but the problem of freezing to death. However, I'm also a gay man."
12_19_2018,homeless,"I would like [TIME], thank you. Thank you. I think that delaying these [ORGANIZATION] fees can be a good thing if you're trying to improve the deliverance of homeless."
12_19_2018,homeless,"Hi. My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I went to [ORGANIZATION] and said, what can I do to help with the homeless issue?"
12_19_2018,homeless; housing crisis,"The city's [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and ORG2 work together on an approach to waive [ORGANIZATION] fees for these shelters to  provided they have confirmation with [ORGANIZATION], and we had that conversation [ORGANIZATION]. Waiving [ORGANIZATION] fees is one tool [LOCATION] has available to address our housing crisis and need for safe and habitable shelters. I want to thank PERSON0 for the presentation and your fantastic work in bringing all the [ORGANIZATION] together and creating what ultimately was a very collaborative process."
12_19_2018,homeless,I'm struck by the presentations earlier [ORGANIZATION] because I see so many parallels in the discussions around honest contracts. opportunities within workforce development and homeless crisis that we are all facing and the housing issues and you're going to hear from me [ORGANIZATION] about how I'm seeing the dots connect between all of these presentations. I won't reiterate what [ORGANIZATION] did
12_19_2018,affordable housing,"We've got to get a head start on this, and I'm hopeful that the city will partner with [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and on top of that, we've got two major housing bonds underway. What better [STREET] than to start talking about multi-housing in these industries, affordable housing? These are new market opportunities, including city facilities, that we have the opportunity to address and make sure that there's an inclusive environment for all those individuals entering these new markets."
12_19_2018,homeless,"And on top of that, appoint staff to be a part of this working equity group because we're going to need some real leadership to support the stakeholders as well as the staff that are doing this hard work. So please grant  the opportunity for these special procurements to take [STREET] so that we can move into the real work of ensuring that we are getting the young individuals, even some of the homeless population involved in getting a job that will be sustainable for [ORGANIZATION]. So thank you for the time [DATE], and I just hope that we can rustle up in [LOCATION] with some innovative ways to work together."
12_19_2018,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], my name is [ORGANIZATION], and I'm a policy advisor to Mayor [PERSON], and it is my great pleasure to be before you again [ORGANIZATION]. The item you are about to be walked through is the result of hundreds, if not thousands, of community conversations, phone calls, e-mails, outreach on the streets, media stories, internal  stakeholder meetings, and a true effort by government to be responsive to the livability concerns and the humanitarian crisis playing out on our streets. One of my first assignments in the mayor's office...  [PERSON], was to gather all of the major property-owning jurisdictions within [ORGANIZATION], including our internal property-owning bureaus, [PERSON], ORG2, [PERSON], and others, with the purpose of discussing how we've standardized managing our property with a baseline understanding that we do not currently have enough affordable housing or shelter within our region."
12_19_2018,homelessness; unhoused,"Cleanups are not the answer to solving homelessness. Housing is. However, it is also our duty as government to maintain our property for the public health and safety of everyone within [ORGANIZATION], both those that are housed and unhoused."
12_19_2018,homelessness,What you will hear before you [ORGANIZATION] is another step in the process of reducing the impact of unsheltered homelessness and improving service connection citywide. I would now like to pass this off to Representative PERSON0. Thank you.
12_19_2018,homelessness,"My name is [ORGANIZATION], Mayor [PERSON] and Counselors. Thanks for having me up here. I work for [ORGANIZATION], and I'm the [ORGANIZATION] Manager for [ORGANIZATION]."
12_19_2018,homelessness,"Before I go any further, I want to thank PERSON0 and [PERSON] on my staff for the hard work that they put in over [ORGANIZATION] to get this over the finish line. And I'd also like to thank [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION], PERSON3, PERSON4, PERSON5, [PERSON], and our colleagues at [ORGANIZATION],  I will now share with you what this ORG2 is, how it will work, and why I believe it is beneficial for all members in our community. This ORG2 shifts responsibility for campsite cleanup, where we collect, inventory, and store personal belongings on [ORGANIZATION] properties within the city of [ORGANIZATION], from [ORGANIZATION] to [LOCATION]."
12_19_2018,homelessness,"Throughout the growth of [ORGANIZATION], the Homelessness and Urban Camping Impact Reduction Program, pursuit of impact reduction interventions that do not always require the removal and storage of personal property has been a central focus. Over [ORGANIZATION], we have observed quantifiable decreases in the impacts of unsanctioned encampments on city properties using these strategies. An example of an impact reduction intervention that has helped produce these results is [ORGANIZATION]."
12_19_2018,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] is a homeless-to-work program that consists of a total of five trucks with two employees each. They are dispatched to respond to every report received by the city's one-point-a-contact system and are usually able to do so in [ORGANIZATION]. They engage with folks in encampments, collect trash, debris, distribute trash bags."
12_19_2018,homelessness,"This [ORGANIZATION] will allow these successful strategies to be deployed on ORG1 properties in the city of [ORGANIZATION] as well. This will provide consistency across the city for neighborhoods, service providers, individuals experiencing homelessness. DATE0, folks whose property has been collected on state highway rights-of-[STREET] is stored just outside of [PERSON] in an ORG1 facility."
12_19_2018,homeless,"We were borrowing that truck so often that the – PERSON0 thought it would be a good idea that we get our own – And so we did, and it's just continued to grow and be successful. So there's folks that are coming out of the criminal justice system, recovering from addiction, and formerly homeless that are out interacting with folks."
12_19_2018,houseless,"a higher level of consistency, and improved livability for the community and our houseless individuals in need. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. [PERSON]."
12_19_2018,homeless,Don't just come near me. And I wanted to bring up the fact that you guys are using positive fascist cleaning to clean up these homeless camps. People are not getting their stuff back.
12_19_2018,homeless,"Even when the city goes in there with...  [ORGANIZATION] slave labor, they still don't get their stuff back. Right now, there's a group of both conservatives and liberals, cop watchers, and we're getting together and we're basically asking the mayor to resign because the lack of care that you have for the homeless, the fact that the police are not doing their jobs...  and people are being assaulted on the streets. You're allowing riots in the streets during protests."
12_19_2018,homeless,This administration has been continually hammering against the homeless community  and you've got a huge homeless population that have camps all over the [STREET]. Thank you. Good morning.
12_19_2018,homeless,I think it is. I've been homeless. My family has been homeless.
12_19_2018,homeless,"DATE0 of high school, I was homeless. Okay. And homeless camps, they do sound bad."
12_19_2018,homeless,I think that that is pretty messed up. The homeless man house out front of FAC0. Where else am I going with this?
12_19_2018,homelessness,"Okay, an urgent public interest. I am the public. Houselessness, homelessness, people out on the streets are in urgent need."
12_19_2018,homeless,"Thank you, Mayor and commissioners, for allowing me to speak. The citizens of [ORGANIZATION] have been waiting for action on unregulated campsites since [ORGANIZATION], when the city swept the homeless population living on FAC0 into our neighborhoods. The official comment of a previous administration at the time was, everything went smoothly, everything was quiet, and went according to plan."
12_19_2018,homeless; unhoused,"This whack-a-mole approach clearly is not working for the citizens of [ORGANIZATION], housed and unhoused alike. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] makes it possible for the city and [ORGANIZATION] to adopt an intergovernmental agreement giving the City of [ORGANIZATION] authority over the multi-use path, allowing enforcement consistent with city-owned property. I strongly support the adoption of the [ORGANIZATION] by the city as a first step to getting homeless population out of tents and into humane housing, whether that be treatment, transitional housing, supportive housing, or any other type of housing.  or permanent housing."
12_19_2018,homelessness,"The first is the transparency between the city, people experiencing homelessness, social service providers, and the general public. It's beneficial to all involved to bring [ORGANIZATION] property under the city's procedure so that there's an efficient and consistent approach to camp cleanup notification periods, enforcement practices, and property storage policies across [ORGANIZATION]. I want to thank Mr. [PERSON], please, seriously."
12_19_2018,homelessness; affordable housing,"And particularly around this really thorny and complex issue of homelessness, we've been working on a whole host of fronts, from prevention to improved shelter, which we talked about earlier today, to innovations, we talked about that earlier today with [ORGANIZATION],  to services like mental health and addiction services that people need to get off and stay off the [STREET], to our strategies around transitioning people into housing, to our strategies to create low-income and affordable housing, to the conversations we've had as a council around permanent supportive housing. This is just one piece of a much, much bigger strategy to help solve this problem that I hope  everyone in this community is unified in agreeing is urgent, is important, and that we must work together to solve. I vote aye."
12_19_2018,affordable housing,"The [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]east Neighborhood Strategy was established in [ORGANIZATION] by and for the community. The strategy prioritizes families and individuals with generational ties to [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]east [ORGANIZATION] for new affordable housing opportunities, both in rental and in homeownership. And we work to stabilize long-term community residents with home repair programs."
12_19_2018,affordable housing,"And then finally, to review our [ORGANIZATION] production. By [LOCATION], through a combination of all of the products that we offer, including direct subsidy, inclusionary zoning, and then the old, what was known as multi-program, we will have reached heights of new affordable housing [LOCATION], topping more than 800. This brings the total number of units in our regulated portfolio to 14,400 units."
12_19_2018,affordable housing,"Though we don't have exact figures on the rental market, we have estimated 125,000 units in the rental market. If that is indeed the case, 12% of all rental units in the city of [ORGANIZATION] would be regulated by the city of [ORGANIZATION] as affordable housing. In real terms, the number of units that we opened [ORGANIZATION] means housing for approximately 1,800 [ORGANIZATION]ers."
12_19_2018,affordable housing,"DATE0, we expect to increase our affordable housing production with more than 1,000 new units, welcoming families. And here are just a few of the highlights of the buildings that have opened [PERSON] or are expected to open DATE2. Vibrant, that you will see in the lower right-hand corner, is actually the property once known as FAC0 and FAC1 in [ORGANIZATION], which is..."
12_19_2018,homeless; affordable housing,"FAC0 is the property formerly known as FAC1 and FAC2 that will be especially prioritized for homeless families leaving the homeless family system and receiving great services and affordable housing with [ORGANIZATION],  It's a very tall building. You can't miss it. If you're on [PERSON], you'll see it very plainly."
12_19_2018,affordable housing,"Commissioner [PERSON]? That slide really shows what Commissioner [PERSON] refers to a lot, is that affordable housing doesn't have to be ugly housing, that these could well be designed by the highest highfalutin developers. They're really nice."
12_19_2018,affordable housing,"with the folks in the basement, the brooms and the mops in the basement, furiously trying to dig out as the floodwaters come into the building. We know how to build strong partnerships and deliver multifamily affordable housing. We know how to tackle problems that are in front of us."
12_19_2018,housing crisis,"There are limits to what we can do locally, and that's why we have to be careful about setting expectations.  making progress, adding new units, doing everything we can, but [ORGANIZATION] can't solve the national housing crisis. It's going to take more than [ORGANIZATION], but I am pleased that we're doing our part. Thank you for your excellent work."
12_19_2018,affordable housing,"We brought 146 units to the northeast [ORGANIZATION] area under the northeast neighborhood housing strategy with 370 more units to come. We have over 350 affordable units that were already permitted by [ORGANIZATION] as of [ORGANIZATION], and that number is expected to rise precipitously. And our affordable housing bond has already purchased 634 units of affordable housing."
12_19_2018,homeless; affordable housing,"We've approached it with data-driven solutions. We have used innovative financing tools, and we have a sense of collective urgency to address this important issue. In pursuing its strategic initiatives, the bond, the inclusionary housing program, supportive housing, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], the multi-program, and other efforts, the ORG2 is working hard to move us closer to addressing our city's affordable housing needs."
12_19_2018,homeless; homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION] is another favorite. We helped launch this chapter in [ORGANIZATION], the first chapter outside of [PERSON]. It provides accessibility to soccer for homeless youth or those in danger of being homelessness."
12_19_2018,houseless,"And whereas, in accordance with [PERSON] and 19, [ORGANIZATION] recognizes the rights of all people to freedom of movement and expression and to not be unnecessarily surveilled. And whereas, in accordance with Article 16, [ORGANIZATION] recognizes the need to affirm gender diversity and the importance of inclusive acts that do not privilege cisgender people over people who may be gender nonconforming or transgender. And whereas, in accordance with [PERSON], [DATE], and 2[DATE], we do not accept public or private acts of disregard and contempt that present as cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment, and that outrage the conscience of humankind in [ORGANIZATION] for our communities of color—  Members of our community who are houseless, indigenous, internally displaced, immigrant, refugee, asylum-seeking, transgender and LGBTQ individuals, people living with different mental and physical abilities, those who are poor and experiencing poverty, women, youth, and aging, and families impacted by incarceration and the re-entry community in the city of [PERSON]."
12_12_2019,homelessness,So you're getting into some new areas that maybe you haven't gotten into before in terms of helping with homelessness. And so there may be some new types of activities and internal controls that would be associated with that. That would be something to perhaps get some feedback from your staff.
12_12_2019,homeless,"Or right outside the hotel, there's thousands of homeless folks that could daily eat this food. It was a really hard reality for me to come to terms with that every day at work I had to throw away perfectly acceptable food. Some of it just because it had a tiny blemish on it and we could not put it out on the buffet."
10_18_2017,homeless; homelessness; affordable housing,"So, colleagues, homelessness, as you all well know, is a humanitarian crisis which threatens the dignity and safety of very vulnerable people in our community. Seventy-two percent of the people sleeping outside reported that they've experienced a mental illness, chronic physical condition, and or a substance use disorder. Supportive housing marries affordable housing with support services, primarily serving people who are chronically homeless and with disabilities who cannot succeed in traditional affordable housing without support services."
10_18_2017,homelessness,"Supportive housing is one of the most effective tools for ending homelessness among people who are generally among the most vulnerable and most visible people experiencing homelessness in our community. In an analysis prepared for [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] calculated the need for over 2,000 new supportive housing units in [ORGANIZATION]. We're going to prepare a plan outlining the strategies and resource requirements for creating 2,000 units of supportive housing over a [ORGANIZATION] period."
10_18_2017,homeless,"And my comments will overlap a little bit with yours. But before I make my comments, may I invite [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], to come forward, [PERSON], Director of [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], the Director of [ORGANIZATION] and a Home for Everyone, and PERSON3, who I understand is here to share a personal story. Thank you, sir."
10_18_2017,homeless; homelessness; housing crisis,"Operation 305, where we work to end veterans' homelessness. [ORGANIZATION], and the list goes on and on. Mayor, I'm proud to be part of this council, which has already [ORGANIZATION] taken important steps to address our housing crisis."
10_18_2017,homelessness,"Working with the county to open new shelter beds, extending the housing state of emergency, enacting historic renter protections and then extending them, making new and significant investments in [ORGANIZATION]. I believe [ORGANIZATION]'s action is yet another step forward. We're having a big community conversation about homelessness and the increase in very vulnerable people on our streets."
10_18_2017,homeless; homelessness,"The most recent point-in-time count showed that while more people are moving from the streets to shelter, chronic homelessness is up. And about two-thirds of the people surveyed that are living on the streets reported a mental illness or an addiction or a physical barrier or some combination. Chronically homeless men and women are the hardest to house, face the greatest barriers, and are at the highest risk of dying on our streets."
10_18_2017,housing crisis,"The resolution before us calls for 2,000 new units of supportive housing over [ORGANIZATION]. It's not enough, and no, it won't solve the housing crisis, but it will make a big difference in the lives of the people we serve. To craft and then advance this vision, we've assembled [ORGANIZATION]."
10_18_2017,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION],  [PERSON]-County Joint Office of Homeless Services, [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, and all of our nonprofit community partners. This resolution directs our partners to come together and develop a roadmap for accomplishing our goal, and that includes identifying existing and new resources to fund the services. Mayor and colleagues, I want to thank [ORGANIZATION] and Commissioner [PERSON] for their leadership at the county."
10_18_2017,homelessness,"Thank you so much for having me here [ORGANIZATION]. Since I became chair of [ORGANIZATION], we've been working together, the city and the county, to build a more rational and robust response to homelessness. Step one was pulling everyone together through a home for everyone, setting big goals and aligning our resources around a simple strategy, prevention, housing, and shelter."
10_18_2017,homelessness,"Thank you. Step two was making that partnership real with [ORGANIZATION], bringing all of our resources under one roof, giving us the ability to respond to the forces that [STREET] homelessness in real time. And we're here to talk [ORGANIZATION] about what I see as the third step, a big commitment to supportive housing, which takes what we've learned in this [LOCATION]'s point-in-time count and what we're learning in our efforts to reform our public safety system,  and what we've been learning during the health care reform and putting it all into practice."
10_18_2017,affordable housing,We know that a jail bed or the waiting room of an emergency room are not the places to overcome these challenges. People need a home. But the reality is that affordable housing doesn't always come with these services.
10_18_2017,affordable housing,"Supportive housing is affordable housing that has the intensive services that people need to stay healthy and stable and successfully housed. And throughout our health care system, our mental health care system, and throughout public safety system, we're paying for apartments just like these. But we need more."
10_18_2017,homeless,"Thank you. Thank you. Mayor, Commissioners, [ORGANIZATION], Director of [ORGANIZATION], thanks for the opportunity to be here in support of this important effort."
10_18_2017,homelessness,"In some cases, this supportive housing looks like [ORGANIZATION] own FAC0, a permanent supportive housing community that was designed and is staffed with appropriate property management and resident services to serve some of the most vulnerable people in our community coming out of homelessness with a home. utilizing principles of harm reduction and housing first. We're fortunate [ORGANIZATION] that we're joined by a colleague of mine who in a bit will share far more eloquently than I can what that means in real terms."
10_18_2017,homelessness,"What we are lacking in is the necessary scale. We have a lot of experience to build on, and partners across the systems that touch people in homelessness agree that now is the time to lean into this effort. We need to expand and we need to keep learning, and we need to focus on ensuring that as we build on our current efforts, we continue to make sure that what we're doing makes real our commitment to address the persistent racial disparities that exist in homelessness in our community."
10_18_2017,homeless,"So I've experienced homeless at a really young age. Okay. My family, my dad, and my two brothers, we lived in the back of our station wagon in the ninth grade behind my high school."
10_18_2017,homelessness,This led to me later on in my life to [ORGANIZATION] of incarcerations due to my addiction and [ORGANIZATION] homelessness. It's been a rough [STREET]. Been in and out of treatment centers.
10_18_2017,homeless,"Now I'm a taxpayer, and I would like nothing more than my tax dollars to go toward more housing opportunities like I have got. I just want to close by saying one more quote. This one's by [ORGANIZATION], and she says, Homeless shelters, human hunger, and suffering have become normalized in the richest nation on earth."
10_18_2017,homelessness,"Yeah, probably. So I'm genuinely excited to be here. There's been so much important work happening DATE0 around housing and homelessness, but [LOCATION] is really a unique day."
10_18_2017,homeless; homelessness,"We've done a lot of important work over [ORGANIZATION] since launching [ORGANIZATION] to create more opportunities for people experiencing homelessness, but I don't think there is an effort that's going to prove to be more important to the success of our work than what we're proposing to launch [LOCATION]. We are preventing, placing, retaining, and sheltering more people DATE2 than at any time. Over 29,000 of our neighbors received assistance just through the programs funded with local, city, and county homeless program funding [ORGANIZATION]."
10_18_2017,homeless; homelessness,"We're piloting new interventions, and we're expanding the ones that work. But we're continuing to lose ground with one of the most vulnerable populations on our streets, those who are chronically homeless, people who have been homeless a long time and are struggling with one or more serious disabilities. The increase in chronic homelessness accounted for the vast majority of the overall increase in homelessness in the last point-in-time count."
10_18_2017,homelessness,"No other population group grew faster. DATE0 we're talking about an intervention, often the only intervention, that works to end someone's chronic homelessness. Supportive housing."
10_18_2017,homelessness,"Supportive housing was an innovation in [ORGANIZATION] when we launched the first [LOCATION] plan to end homelessness. DATE2, there are literally volumes of research documenting not just that supportive housing works for those who benefit from it, but that it is the most cost-effective intervention we can make. We've studied it locally through an evaluation of FAC0 and more recently a study by [ORGANIZATION] of different types of supportive housing in the community."
10_18_2017,homeless,"Across the board, what we learned from the research is what we would expect. Even the most chronically homeless individuals start to thrive when they get into supportive housing. They're able to retain that housing long term, and they use far fewer high-cost crisis resources."
10_18_2017,homeless,"For sharing your story. I know how nerve-wracking it is to come to this table and say anything, let alone something so personal. And it's just vitally important that we hear these stories and that the public hears these stories because I think that there is a –  pervasive belief that people who are chronically homeless, people who are experiencing mental illness or addiction, are lost causes, and you are proof that human beings aren't lost causes."
10_18_2017,affordable housing,You're going to take that $[ADDRESS] to make affordable housing more acceptable. And they are not connected properly.
10_18_2017,affordable housing,"If you're on the [STREET] with no money and you're a drug addict, you have nothing to do with affordable housing. Nothing. You need someone to help."
10_18_2017,homelessness,"We are your partners in [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] on the issues of homelessness and housing, and I'm here [ORGANIZATION] to urge your support for this resolution and to say thank you. Thank you for prioritizing permanent supportive housing [ORGANIZATION] with this resolution. and in the bond framework that you adopted [LOCATION]."
10_18_2017,homelessness,"It's a critical component to any city's strategy in addressing homelessness, especially the issue of chronic homelessness, and is a proven national best practice. So I'm pleased to see us moving forward. As you all know, and as we as providers know,  Permanent supportive housing is one of the most difficult types of housing to create."
10_18_2017,homelessness,"So I applaud you for understanding that. One specific piece I want to underline that often gets left out of our public dialogue around homelessness are the issues of families experiencing homelessness, and in particular the need of families with children for permanent supportive housing. Our public dialogue, especially recently around homelessness, has focused heavily on what the community sees in the streets."
10_18_2017,homeless; homelessness,"And that's a reasonable [STREET] to focus because that's what we see [ORGANIZATION]. At [ORGANIZATION], we operate a no-turnaway shelter for families experiencing homelessness. And because of that and because of the [STREET] that the homeless family system works, right now our community isn't typically not seeing kids and their parents waking up in tents and trailers and heading to school in the morning because they all have a [STREET] to sleep at [TIME], and that's in the shelter."
10_18_2017,affordable housing,"They all need affordable housing, but the specific type of housing we're prioritizing here  often it's not the family population that folks are thinking of. So I want to encourage us as we move forward to stay focused and do the work to find out how big the need is among the family population or we're not going to solve that problem. Thank you."
10_18_2017,affordable housing,"But at [DATE], we need funding. Commissioner [PERSON], affordable housing bond, that's called needing funding, understanding that up front and then beginning to create the supportive permanent housing. Now, with that in mind, we can calculate out to $2,000 from..."
10_18_2017,affordable housing,"That's your legacy. The affordable housing bond is Commissioner [PERSON]'s legacy. Now, the challenge to you at [ORGANIZATION], $125 million bond."
10_18_2017,homeless,"So people do become homeless in mass amounts all the time. So I think what we have here, along with this and many other things, we may want to start to consider emergency relief efforts. And what that includes is the same thing we do after Katrina or anything else, except with a twist."
10_18_2017,homeless,Okay. We'll have homeless people there with the people that are healthy. We'll have all the services there.
10_18_2017,housing crisis,"But it's extremely counterproductive for community members to come here and spread misinformation and misunderstanding in the public space. I have confidence that most of you who are in the chambers [ORGANIZATION] understand that some of the things that were said were just a misrepresentation of reality. But I'm concerned for people listening and watching in the community that they may think that we think creating 2,000 units is going to solve our housing crisis."
10_18_2017,housing crisis,"And it's obviously not. So just to be clear, this is one essential piece of a multifaceted solution to alleviating and eventually solving our housing crisis. And it is targeted to a specific population of individuals experiencing mental illness, drug addiction, significant disability, or some combination thereof."
10_18_2017,homeless,"Not all...  2,000 to 4,000 people who are homeless or living in temporary shelter require permanent supportive housing. Many of them have simply been displaced from, economically displaced from their housing. So we are not building permanently supportive housing for those people."
10_18_2017,housing crisis,"We're doing other things like increasing tenant protections,  our inclusionary zoning plan, building housing through our housing bond, our residential infill program, pausing enforcement on tiny homes and RVs, and working with our state and federal delegations on finding more funding and more solutions for what is a national housing crisis. Now for my closing statements. I'm sincerely grateful to serve alongside colleagues who are committed to improving the lives of some of the most vulnerable people in our city."
10_18_2017,homeless,"I also want to give a special warm thank you to [ORGANIZATION], who I've really enjoyed working with [ORGANIZATION], and all of the staff at [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] for being the stewards of these bold visions and for being so capable and ready for whatever challenges we throw their [STREET]. Because of them and the other conveners listed in the resolution, I have great hope that not only will we accomplish these goals, but we will have a clear path to doing even more. I'm very pleased to vote aye."
10_18_2017,homelessness,"And ultimately, I believe people in this city are compassionate and they want to be able to get their arms around something. They want a positive approach to helping to participate in solving this problem. And I believe they're asking us to take...  bold leadership when it comes to the issue of homelessness and people living on our streets."
10_18_2017,homeless,"I intend to put the resources of my administration fully behind this effort. And at [DATE], I believe this is the right response. This is both a compassionate and effective response that will help address the chronically homeless who live on the streets in our community."
10_18_2017,affordable housing,"In addition to the [ORGANIZATION] exemption provided by the [ORGANIZATION], this project will receive an exemption of [ORGANIZATION],  that otherwise would have been due on the affordable units. This project will join the other four projects that have already been approved under [ORGANIZATION], making a total of 31 units affordable in other words market rate developments. Director [PERSON]."
10_18_2017,affordable housing,Excellent. Direct ORG0 to adopt an affordable housing green building policy for new construction and rehabilitation. Now.
10_18_2017,affordable housing,"When we were created DATE0 out of the housing functions of  now [ORGANIZATION], then [PERSON], and ORG2, we referenced the [PERSON] policy, which had been previously, and still to [DATE], to essentially use LEED Gold, Leadership in Environmental and Energy Development Standards. Wow. Actually, originally it was a completely separate policy from the policy for city facilities, and it was just for affordable housing."
10_18_2017,affordable housing,"This happened before. So I think you know the background. There was a policy that was special for affordable housing over time, and after [ORGANIZATION] was formed, we just kind of fell back on [ORGANIZATION]'s policy, which eventually matched the city's."
10_18_2017,affordable housing,"As [ORGANIZATION] said, it's applicable to 20 units or more, affordable housing only, and 10% funding from [ORGANIZATION] or owned by us. And so you know what the big objectives are to improve tenant health and meet our climate action plan and environmental stewardship and all of that, which I can't see. But the practical objective and what we were really going after was to carve out, if you will, from ORG1 and ORG2, the bigger programs which have many, many measures that you can choose from to get all your points, to carve out the measures that had the most benefit on multifamily housing, and to really focus on that and get our points for those measures."
10_18_2017,affordable housing,"It's fine. So grab it so we can get it signed. We have been watching where our money is going on our affordable housing projects and started to feel like it was getting very expensive to continue to do [ORGANIZATION], and we weren't sure what we were getting for that."
10_18_2017,affordable housing,"I mean, I think with climate change happening and it seems like the humane thing to require, I've gone to enough groundbreaking or ribbon cuttings of our affordable housing projects  facilities in [ORGANIZATION] to realize how hot these places are for the individuals who are going to end up living in them. Currently, as a fallback, most of our projects are using portable units that plug into a window panel so that we can get to the units that are overheating, which are usually the west side and the top. We don't often need it on the north side, on the bottom."
10_18_2017,affordable housing,"Over DATE0 I've been doing affordable housing, I've witnessed a growing awareness and implementation of sustainable building practices. Features that were aspirational [LOCATION] are now standard practice, and it's time for a policy that looks forward from here and gently raises the bar. [ORGANIZATION] champions the [ORGANIZATION] plan to progressively achieve carbon-neutral buildings by the year [ORGANIZATION]."
10_18_2017,affordable housing,"I'm [PERSON], the Director of Innovation at [ORGANIZATION], and I'm here on behalf of [ORGANIZATION] to...  I voice my support for ORG2's efforts to create a streamlined and vital green building policy, a policy that should reduce the demands of green certification while ensuring that the deep benefits of green building are included in [ORGANIZATION]'s affordable housing moving forward. Thank you. I believe [PERSON] should be commended for focusing on energy efficiency and air quality as the core measures of green building that benefit our community and the residents of the buildings."
10_18_2017,affordable housing,"So now that you have that background that [ORGANIZATION] just provided to you, we'd like to report on some of the work we did in response to Commissioner [PERSON]'s request related to the [ORGANIZATION].  [ORGANIZATION]. So just briefly for those of you who are new to city council, we started the central city planning process by developing some overall policy guidance and  and then three high-level plans for different central city geographies, and those are listed on the screen before you. Each of these groups had a committee that advised [ORGANIZATION] staff, and the committees were comprised of people who had some sort of stake in the outcome, like advocates for affordable housing, neighborhood interests, environmental interests, and, of course, property owners, business owners, and people who work in the area."
10_18_2017,affordable housing,"We did a bonus and transfer study that started our work on prioritizing the affordable housing bonus. And those materials and...  implementation strategies developed as part of that were not part of any of the quadrant planning work committees. So once all the processes that I just described were complete, staff began to integrate it into an early version of [ORGANIZATION] draft that you have before you."
10_18_2017,affordable housing,"So we have the real possibility of getting a mix of affordable housing into the new development. You know, the baseline sort of things that we get from redevelopment and reinvestment, especially in a situation like this, seemed like they offer a good deal of public value as well as real estate value. Can I touch on another area of concern?"
10_18_2017,affordable housing,"So the only – and that determines the number of square feet that could be built on the piece of land. The only addition to that we are proposing is to increase it to five to one, and mostly that's so that we have a better shot at getting more of the affordable housing. And five to one, an additional one-to-one floor area ratio on that site is about 370,000 square feet of development."
10_18_2017,affordable housing,Aren't we changing the bonuses so it's only bonuses for affordable housing? The main bonus is for affordable housing? That's right.
10_18_2017,affordable housing,"That's correct. So in this area with a base height of 50, if they wanted to go above 50, it's bonus height, and they would have the affordable housing build it on site or pay into the fund. There's also the option for historic preservation, but your first bonus is affordable housing."
10_18_2017,affordable housing,"Special attention will be given to opportunities to include more affordable housing, promote economic development and redevelopment, implement multimodal transportation improvements, including FAC0, which actually uses FAC1, the new bridge, and provide additional open space opportunities under an overall equity strategy for city-led investments in the area. This is in your packet.  or that would be one of the lead implementers of this action item. So that is an amendment that is being proposed by the commissioner."
11_01_2018,affordable housing,"So [ORGANIZATION], I'm happy to announce that the cities of [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON], with [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], have agreed to work together to promote affordable housing, business stabilization, and other development in the corridor in conjunction with light rail, something that will truly move us forward in terms of livability and equity. Now I'd like to invite [PERSON] from ORG2 and PERSON1, [ORGANIZATION]'s General Manager, to provide some opening remarks before the staff presentation. Welcome."
11_01_2018,affordable housing,"We are committed, as obviously the city is as well, to ensuring that we can preserve and expand upon that supply as development occurs in the future with this transit investment. The city's and our partnership in developing an equitable development strategy and housing strategy is critical to avoiding the displacement that has occurred in past public investments for transportation purposes. On [ORGANIZATION], the voters of our region will have an opportunity to support the regional affordable housing bond, and [ORGANIZATION] is committed to ensuring that the appropriate proportion of those funds are spent on maintaining and increasing the supply of affordable housing in this corridor."
11_01_2018,affordable housing,"One of the indications of the continued success of the partnerships is the [ORGANIZATION] on affordable housing, an important cornerstone. This represents extensive collaboration among your bureaus, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], to help address the rising housing costs in this region and the complexities that come with it. This agreement was born out of the inclusive work that [ORGANIZATION] facilitated to advance an equitable housing strategy."
11_01_2018,affordable housing,"So the [ORGANIZATION] spells out a process by which there's an opportunity for cities to acquire some of that land to facilitate affordable housing as the project wraps up. City agencies are also exploring if there are ways that we can acquire property and make that land available to [ORGANIZATION] as part of our contribution to the project, also facilitating housing eventually. Next slide."
11_01_2018,affordable housing,"As we know with our looking at affordable housing transportation choices and what one has to pay to maintain a car really affect the funds that people have to spend on their [DATE] lives. So finding a [STREET] without a tunnel to connect this light rail project to [ORGANIZATION] and provide a meaningful opportunity for students, administrators, and staff to get to the college is very important to us. So the steering committee has asked us to look at some bus shuttle options."
11_01_2018,affordable housing,"So I'll just say. So here's some information on historic resources, a lot of work left to do. [DATE], you'll be asked to accept, adopt the preferred alignment, and direct the project team through [ORGANIZATION] to create a conceptual design report, address issues raised, implement the Ross Island Bridgehead process outlined in the Memorandum of Understanding, tell us to work on developing the local match financing strategy, and have concurrent reports on affordable housing and our progress toward meeting those goals."
11_01_2018,affordable housing,"Our latest surveys show that we have 30% of our students using public transit as their primary mode of travel. With the proposed light rail extension, we anticipate that figure increasing, not only in student ridership, but for our staff as well. Additionally, we appreciate the inclusion of an affordable housing strategy in the corridor planning."
11_01_2018,homelessness; housing insecurity,Recent studies have shown that about half of community college students experience housing insecurity and 13 to 14 percent experience homelessness. The equitable housing strategy is an opportunity to meet the basic needs of our students and their families so they can better focus on their academic success. [ORGANIZATION] does realize that there are some segments of the light rail alignment that are not yet confirmed.
11_01_2018,affordable housing,"Nearly $3 billion for infrastructure plus another $1.5 billion to subsidize affordable housing, some of which will likely be property taken and removed from the tax rolls. The proposed bond measures that in part rely upon residential property taxes to pay off the bonds will unjustly increase the cost of housing for the entire region. The FAC0 line was paid for with [ORGANIZATION] freeway dollars."
11_01_2018,affordable housing,"How does this support land use vision? Okay. [ORGANIZATION] is being given in outer [ORGANIZATION] not to the land use development and affordable housing, but on expanded parking on FAC0 at the expense of the quiet neighborhood, which is far southwest."
11_01_2018,affordable housing,"Probably by the time this is built, $300 million worth of parking being built in this project, which will last for a long time. To compare that, the current [ORGANIZATION] bond is spending about $65 million to acquire naturally occurring affordable housing near transit. So this project is significant.  expecting to spend somewhere between three and five times the amount of money on parking as we're spending to acquire affordable housing."
11_01_2018,affordable housing,"This could be 12 to 1,700 built or acquired affordable housing units near this corridor filled with 3,000 plus maybe 3,600 people or more who would ride transit quite regularly if they  It makes much better sense, I think, to build housing, a lot more housing near this transit corridor line than to build parking. We can bring people into the transit centers with better bus service, dedicated bus lanes, et cetera. And I want to really just...  strike that we should really think about when this will come online and not where we are [ORGANIZATION]."
11_01_2018,affordable housing,"There's lack of affordable housing close to jobs. This is just to say I don't believe that increasing ridership on mass transit is a lost cause. I think  because we have failed to mitigate displacement and because we haven't developed housing strategies alongside these transit projects, we have seen decreased ridership."
11_01_2018,affordable housing,"So can only imagine how bad it's gotten since then. I've been living in the city since then, so. I strongly support a regional agreement to secure land for affordable housing along this route, which is what the [ORGANIZATION] does."
11_01_2018,affordable housing,"been very patient and worked your [STREET] through and been willing to compromise. And that's what we're talking about for this project is let's not compromise where we absolutely need to hold firm, like in affordable housing, like in locally owned businesses. I think in like not providing park and ride spaces for people who don't live in [ORGANIZATION]."
09_29_2016,affordable housing,"Very interesting analysis of the issue about affordable housing and trees, which you also just showed us. Thank you. Great."
11_21_2019,homelessness,It's a compassionate and I believe a better [STREET] to respond to incidents involving the city's homelessness and those experiencing mental health crises in our community. My team has spent a considerable amount of time brainstorming and working on such programs behind the scenes on programs including this.
11_21_2019,unhoused,"When the [ORGANIZATION] published the report that 52% of all arrests affected unhoused people, while that number was a brutal number for us all to grapple with, it also felt very true to what we see [ORGANIZATION] in [STREET] routes. unhoused people, their bodies are inscribed with the trauma of living on the streets. And they are, in a sense, always contending with not being in the right space."
11_21_2019,homelessness,"It's almost like as a society, we're pushing people further and further into poverty and homelessness. Folks that are in law enforcement, their mission is about enforcing the law. Their mission is about dealing with crimes."
11_21_2019,homeless,We need to make sure that people who are homeless are encountering people whose mission is different than that. Their mission is public health. Their mission is making sure that everyone is thriving as much as humanly possible.
11_21_2019,homeless,"And if the police need to be involved, they can be caught. We do have a mental health crisis that's going berserk in this city. Our homeless population tend to have a lack of trust for police response now."
11_21_2019,housing crisis,"These calls that relate to somebody who is just struggling often don't require a police officer or a fire engine to come, but if we don't have anything else, that's who has to come. As important as [ORGANIZATION] is in terms of ensuring that we're sending the right first responder to the appropriate situation,  It won't address the housing crisis unless we're also expanding the available resources for the folks who are being engaged. Our ability to really capitalize on the benefits of that engagement depends on there being resources available, and that means housing."
11_21_2019,homelessness,We in public safety know the system is broken. Criminalizing mental health and homelessness is not the solution. We have been building out a community health assessment team that looks at high utilizers and tries to pair them with the appropriate resources.
11_21_2019,homelessness,"I'm an associate professor of community psychology at [ORGANIZATION], also the director of research for [ORGANIZATION]. I'm [PERSON]. I'm the executive director of ORG2."
11_21_2019,houseless,"And then as far as the services, just reminding everyone, this is a response model that complements a 911 emergency response model. It's within the entire 911 system where for these low acuity, non-emergency, behavioral health calls or informational only calls for fire and police, that we don't need to send a police officer  [ORGANIZATION] AND FOUR FIREFIGHTERS ON A HOUSELESS AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH LOW [PERSON]. THIS WILL FREE UP OUR PUBLIC SAFETY WHEN IT COMES TO FIRE RESPONSE AND CRIME RESPONSE."
11_21_2019,unhoused,"I just came from a pizza party because the vendors are celebrating the fact that we got this far. They've been so involved in this the whole [STREET] from really dreaming up the...  the plan talking to us about these ideas for a long time, being involved in the campaign, being involved in doing surveys of other unhoused people, and even judging the logo contest. So a number of them are here, probably in the balcony because a pizza party went long, and some of our staff are here too."
11_21_2019,unhoused,"And this work really is animated, or this perspective is animated, our work from [ORGANIZATION] through our newspaper and our reporting. But also because all of us at [ORGANIZATION] spend so much time together, and we have about 170 vendors who, about half of whom are unhoused. We all share the same coffee pot, so we share a lot of stories, we share a lot of awareness of each other's lives."
11_21_2019,unhoused,"So just briefly, I had the privilege of serving on the community engagement work group, co-chairing it with [ORGANIZATION], who works on Commissioner [PERSON]'s staff. And we did a number of things. We really put forward the idea that we wanted people who are unhoused to be a part of the development of this pilot, and we wanted to figure out how that could be possible."
11_21_2019,unhoused,"So we set up a number of listening sessions. First and foremost was the idea that  we all needed to go to where people who are unhoused are at, that we too often expect them to come into spaces that they aren't usually coming into. So we went to [ORGANIZATION]."
11_21_2019,homelessness,"So the next phase of the community outreach was to conduct a survey. And that was done with [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] who's following up on the evaluation side also. And we conducted that with ORG2, [PERSON], [LOCATION], and [ORGANIZATION]."
11_21_2019,homelessness,And FAC0 vendors went out with [ORGANIZATION] students and other community members. Each survey team had at least one person who had experienced homelessness or was currently experiencing homelessness. And they went out and surveyed people on trails and squats and camps and shelters to find out what people wanted in FAC1 response.
11_21_2019,unhoused,"Number seven, a lot of people who are unhoused just wanted to educate other people in the community about how to use emergency calls. A lot of folks are saying they just feel like people dial FAC0 a little too easily. And number eight, treat people with compassion and dignity."
11_21_2019,unhoused,"Just the finally we also helped hold a logo contest and one of the things that we were able to do with the logo contest was have boxes depository boxes at [ORGANIZATION] as well as at [STREET] roots and Commissioner [PERSON]'s office so that they were in a number of places where people who are unhoused could enter the contest and  And again, like the survey experience, we were really pleased to have this be a situation where unhoused folks were sitting alongside housed folks to do the judging. We had three FAC0 vendors with staff from Mayor [PERSON]'s office and from your office, Commissioner [PERSON]. And I think one of the things that was really powerful about that process was the fact that  that people in the community were able to try to draw what I think of as a kind of civic imagination around this."
11_21_2019,homeless,"One person really drew a lot about mental health and supporting LGBTQ people and just this kind of compassionate illustration. And another person made a beautiful drawing and then said she dedicated it to her mother who, in [ORGANIZATION], was homeless and died on our streets. And I think I'll end it there because that is something that underlies all of this."
11_21_2019,unhoused,"The fact that we do know too many people die on our streets and the more we can provide people hope and we can, you know, reduce the amount of trauma they experience, the more we can contribute to a healthier [STREET] for unhoused people. Thank you very much. Thanks, [ORGANIZATION]."
11_21_2019,unhoused,"We need to understand how it's operating and what changes and adaptations are necessary along the [STREET] to make sure it's working for unhoused individuals, for the ORG0 team, and for the community. Commissioner [PERSON] expressed her dedication to making sure the pilot was evaluated and informed by data when I met her at the listening sessions in [ORGANIZATION]. PERSON1 invited us to co-develop a survey methodology and report highlighting the critical perspectives of unhoused individuals."
11_21_2019,homelessness,"This gives us a great deal of confidence that the proposed pilot is not only what key stakeholders want and need, but also what will be successful. [ORGANIZATION] will work closely with [ORGANIZATION] from [ORGANIZATION], Commissioner [PERSON]'s office, and many others throughout the pilot program to conduct an ongoing evaluation. We are finalizing our primary performance measures and we welcome feedback and recommendations."
11_21_2019,unhoused,"In addition to these quantitative outcomes, it's also vital that we assess the experiences of unhoused individuals who are affected by [ORGANIZATION]. At this point, we can go back to the video. Thank you."
11_21_2019,homelessness,"We will then produce a [ORGANIZATION] pilot review summarizing all of the outcomes and provide formal recommendations for modifying the program and scaling up citywide. Throughout this entire process, we will continue working as we began, in close collaboration with key stakeholders representing the needs and experiences of those who will be most impacted by [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON] is honored to be a part of this innovative, community-centered pilot program, and we thank you for the opportunity."
11_21_2019,houseless,"And a recommendation for a station downtown in the core, but that's where all the resources are. We also know that we have vulnerable populations and houseless out in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]. And so we wanted to see within the pilot program what the turnaround would be and how effective the pilot would be when you're,  further removed from resources."
11_21_2019,affordable housing,"So, this program is desperately needed and has been for [ORGANIZATION]. The federal government is chronically underfunding affordable housing, mental health care, and addiction services. And the state of [ORGANIZATION], in particular, is failing individuals experiencing mental health and addiction issues with some of the lowest levels of service in the nation."
11_21_2019,homelessness; housing crisis,"Therefore, the city of [ORGANIZATION] is also struggling. We're in [ORGANIZATION] of a housing crisis, and while it's largely driven by unaffordability of housing, when it comes to those experiencing chronic homelessness, it's also a mental health and addiction crisis. This is a pilot program, but it's already a proven response, and I have the utmost confidence that [LOCATION] we're going to be back here talking about expanding it and how we're going to find the funding."
11_21_2019,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] mental health specialist [PERSON] is currently conducting a beta test of mental health first aid training with city staff and hopefully [ORGANIZATION] we're going to be able to  [PERSON] that citywide and then eventually offer it broadly to community members. So we have a network of [ORGANIZATION] members across the entire city who are more prepared to respond to people in crisis and who know what what to do, so I want to offer the support of my office and [PERSON] if there's any interest in connecting with other  those existing resources and building capacity in our communities and protect particularly the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood. Being homeless is not a crime."
11_21_2019,homeless,"And we'll have to resolve those bumps in the [STREET] ahead. And I also acknowledge this is not a panacea.  for the homeless crisis that we're seeing on our streets. And I want to always remind ourselves that this is yet one more evolution, one more important step in providing services that we need to provide in the community, but it is not in and of itself a sufficient action."
11_21_2019,affordable housing,"The amendment would add a home ownership option to this development bonus. And one reason why we're grouping these together is because there are three pieces that work together for the same thing. Basically, there's a zoning code amendment that references Title 30, which is our affordable housing title."
11_21_2019,affordable housing,"So affordable at 80% would be what, about $75,000 that somebody would have to make before they would qualify for affordable housing option? Those are good questions. I am deferring to [ORGANIZATION] with [ORGANIZATION]."
11_21_2019,affordable housing,"PERSON0 I [ORGANIZATION] mayor, um, I Didn't object so I vote no PERSON2 The amendments are adopted. Next up is Amendment 2, which amends the affordable housing parking exemption."
11_21_2019,affordable housing,"This is, this amendment would be exempting an existing affordable housing  I'm sorry, expanding an affordable housing exemption for parking. Currently, if you're within 500 feet of frequent service transit lines, that's about one-tenth of a mile. Projects that include affordable units through the inclusionary housing program are exempt from providing parking and  The intent of this amendment is the same reason why we have that exemption, which is to help reduce costs associated with providing parking as part of compact development to really support the ability to get housing projects that include affordable units."
11_21_2019,affordable housing,"When you took parking out, inclusionary housing developments actually did pencil and actually became fairly attractive to do. So what we found is whether or not you're requiring parking definitely plays into the feasibility of projects that include affordable units. Basically, what this amendment would do would be to apply the frequent service transit affordable housing parking exemption to any affordable housing projects citywide in those zones."
11_21_2019,affordable housing,"but it does not make the presumption that every housing project would have it, but when parking is provided, the thinking is that it should support electric vehicles, but that project hasn't really envisioned a future where we anticipate that everyone will have that. Your economic analysis showed that on the margin, the parking requirement could be the difference between whether an affordable housing project is viable or not, is that correct? Yes, it is."
11_21_2019,affordable housing,"And also remember that many of these buildings are the naturally occurring affordable housing. These are some of the big old housing that's already been subdivided into smaller units. And so to provide an incentive to get rid of those and then something, whatever's going to go in is going to be more expensive, doesn't seem prudent either."
11_21_2019,affordable housing,"those properties would not be able to use development bonuses  The [STREET] the regulations written is that in the inner neighborhoods You would not have to go through a special review procedure because we have a very well tightly knit transit system in those areas, but there are more gaps in the [ORGANIZATION] system in [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] and they would need to document that they're within that walking distance So even if most projects could you know? Use the bonus there'd be more process involved with documentation Something to consider too is most of the bonuses are for affordable housing up to now."
11_21_2019,affordable housing,"We haven't had a big run for inclusionary housing bonuses so at least up to now we haven't had a problem of affordable housing projects using bonuses and  broadly in the city. So up to now it has not been a huge problem. So with that, staff does believe given the placement of the mixed-use and multi-dwelling zoning close to transit, we don't support additional process or an amendment that would require that the documentation of being within that distance.  Very good."
11_21_2019,affordable housing,"Thank you for that. I will say, I guess the question is, do we anticipate public transit improvements taking [STREET] while we're building affordable housing? Since most of the building will take [STREET] in [ORGANIZATION], I can tell you that there's a lot of people that don't live within a thousand feet of public transit."
11_21_2019,housing crisis,"I don't understand. If we believe that we are in a housing crisis, it seems to me we need to find ways to increase the amount  workforce and lower-income housing not put restrictions and limitations on the ability to build it. Because we're also in a climate crisis and we need to stop people from driving."
11_21_2019,affordable housing,"Okay. All right, well the intent of this amendment is really to facilitate transfer opportunities from sites and the situations where you could transfer development opportunity is where a site is preserving historic buildings and there's some special provisions for seismic upgrade transfers and also you can transfer development rights for where you're preserving existing affordable housing or where you're preserving large trees. Currently, in [ORGANIZATION] recommended draft, transfers are only allowed between sites in the same type of zone."
11_21_2019,affordable housing,"The intent was really to prioritize affordable housing as to what gives you greater scale. So there are some inherent limits on how much transfer you could receive, and this amendment would make it easier to find spots where it could be useful to receive some additional scale. Thank you."
11_21_2019,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]. So the [ORGANIZATION] doesn't tend to commit funds to a project unless it has the zone capacity for the number of units that it's proposing. But this says here, bullet point two, this property is one of [ORGANIZATION]'s affordable housing bond projects and is proposed for 88 low-income units."
11_21_2019,homelessness; affordable housing,"It looks like a grand old house, but it was originally an old people's home. and it's received approval for funding through [ORGANIZATION]. They're proposing 88 affordable units including family housing and housing for people who experienced homelessness."
11_21_2019,affordable housing,"So the 88 units that are currently funded under [ORGANIZATION] can be delivered under the existing zoning. With this change, it provides a little bit more flexibility for innovative housing, which is the developer, and they may be able to add additional units beyond the 88 units. And they are an affordable housing developer."
11_21_2019,affordable housing,"They are an affordable housing developer, and the proposal is for 88 units, 12 permanent supportive housing units, 43... Family size units at 28 units 50 sorry 59 of the total units will be at from at 60% and below and 29 of the total units will be at 30% and below so to be clear they could meet the 88 units under the current zoning That zoning change gives them some more flexibility To potentially add more units to the overall site. Yeah,"
11_21_2019,affordable housing,"I mean, one, we wouldn't commit it outside of a process, but we wouldn't commit it if it wasn't zoned for the number of units. Correct. And do you have a written contract that says these 88 affordable housing units will be built?"
11_21_2019,affordable housing,"And you could change it to affordable housing units with it on a historic registry? Yeah, they're both rehabbing and doing some new construction on the site. All right."
11_21_2019,affordable housing,"Um,  [ORGANIZATION]. Well, I strongly support this [ORGANIZATION] amendment because I believe it advances several priorities. I think this is a great project for the affordable housing bond and it will provide more than [ADDRESS] to live and"
12_21_2016,homelessness,"Thank you. [DATE], please. Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding homelessness."
12_21_2016,homelessness,"So I've been – let's say [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION] –  Many, many. You have them listed there. So the tiny house movement is basically five different sections."
12_21_2016,houseless,"I just want to thank you. We...  I was able to participate in that design charrette that you and others were involved in with a bunch of young architects and activists and houseless folks and people from [ORGANIZATION]. And then they built, I think many of us got to see, I did, the prototypes of all those designs and displayed them out in a park block."
12_21_2016,homeless,"Our radio system may be going to come in under budget, but whenever we talk about public safety and emergency, it's actually important to go back to item number 1-420, when [ORGANIZATION] talked about the fact that thousands of people are unsheltered on our streets. Now, we know that this is bond money. We can't save lives of homeless people  with that money, in theory, that would be unconstitutional or illegal."
12_21_2016,affordable housing,"Okay.  [ORGANIZATION], provide affordable housing through an inclusionary housing program. And [LOCATION], provide affordable housing through an inclusionary housing program and update the multiple unit limited tax exemption program. These are second readings and final votes."
12_21_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,I'm proud to serve on a council that has prioritized investments in affordable housing and addressing housing crisis in our community. [ORGANIZATION] was mentioned previously. We've had two farewell parties.
12_21_2016,housing crisis,"But inclusionary housing, if you look at the record around the country, in and of itself does not solve the housing crisis. But it does do something very important, which is it gives us information  a mechanism for ensuring that affordable homes are dispersed in high opportunity areas throughout our community. And, [ORGANIZATION], you've said this and others have said it, and I just want to reiterate it."
12_21_2016,affordable housing,"And families are scared that they may have to look for new housing on short notice. With this vote DATE0, we are taking a critical step forward, assuring more affordable housing for Portlanders DATE1 and for future generations. Affordable housing will DATE1 be included in market rate developments throughout our city."
12_21_2016,affordable housing,"And while we might not agree with all aspects of the policy, and they may not agree with all aspects of the policy we're about to adopt, I truly believe that we all want this policy to work and to achieve more affordable housing options. And you can't do that without the development community. Thank you."
12_21_2016,affordable housing,"And to Mayor [PERSON].  who has always recognized the needs of Portlanders for safe and affordable housing and sponsored the zoning code portion of this program. And then certainly, last but not least, the team at [ORGANIZATION]. Director [PERSON], who from the moment he was in the interview process for this position, [ORGANIZATION], I believe, said,  believed we should adopt an inclusive housing program."
12_21_2016,affordable housing,"DATE0 the sooner we're going to get more mixed-use neighborhoods and more affordable housing for everybody in the city so again thanks to [ORGANIZATION] for all of our hard work on this and also to PERSON1 my chief of staff pleased to vote aye Well, I want to second all those thank yous and bravos for great work in both the community and the city."
12_21_2016,affordable housing,"And the foreclosure process, I went through a foreclosure process. I know what that's like, and it's not fun. And when you talk affordable housing, and when [ORGANIZATION] says, Commissioner [PERSON], excuse me, says everybody is going to get housing."
12_21_2016,affordable housing,"It'll help everybody. I'm thinking affordable housing starts at $60,000. What about the people that make zero to $60,000?"
12_21_2016,affordable housing,They're not included in any of the affordable housing that you've mentioned [ORGANIZATION] and [LOCATION] and previous. We need to not keep fooling the public that affordable housing is something that includes everybody because it doesn't. And the people that you're trying to ignore are not going away.
12_21_2016,affordable housing,"I lost my house. Affordable housing should include everybody, not just people that make $60,000 and above. That doesn't include me."
12_21_2016,homelessness,"Some of the public benefits that we agreed upon is a commitment to paying a minimum of $15 per hour for every employee, efforts to hire 50% of new hires from underrepresented populations, the creation of a food artisan incubator program to focus on inclusive entrepreneurship,  Efforts to create flexibility in employee schedules and seek to hire employees at full-time versus part-time.  and internships for youth, and community engagement around homelessness and addiction issues in [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] in general. I'll just interrupt to ask a question. I really appreciate the commitment to as many full-time permanent jobs as possible."
12_21_2016,affordable housing,"Thank you, Mayor. [ORGANIZATION], the council approved the purchase of our first property under the voter-approved affordable housing bond, the 263-unit [ORGANIZATION]. This will help prevent the displacement, prevent displacement, and provide new deeply affordable housing for hundreds of families."
12_21_2016,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] insures mortgages for affordable housing and for market rate housing through this program. And our intent would be to use the [ORGANIZATION] money in the form of a loan for the rehabilitation needs of the property.  which we estimate to be $10 million. We may also use some of the [ORGANIZATION] money, up to $20 million in total, for replacement reserves."
12_21_2016,homeless; affordable housing,"PERSON0 So I think this is a great deal. I've been following how much we've been spending through [ORGANIZATION] since I've been working on the homeless and affordable housing issue here in [ORGANIZATION] and throughout the country, really."
12_21_2016,affordable housing,So I hope during this process of spending the other $[ADDRESS] to produce more affordable housing. So that's all I have to say about it. Thank you.
12_21_2016,homeless; homelessness,"And I'm here with the faith community, again, to say that we do want [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] on that do not buy list [ORGANIZATION], not [DATE] from [ORGANIZATION]. We don't want it invested in at all. You all just worked on homelessness by creating housing, and [ORGANIZATION] is already made 25,000 families homeless in [ORGANIZATION]."
12_21_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"We're here as people who routinely draft and edit the proclamations that are read in this chamber, and we thought it would only be fitting that the last item on the agenda be a proclamation for you. So with that said, whereas [ORGANIZATION] has faithfully served the citizens of [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION], first as a city commissioner and then as mayor of [ORGANIZATION], and whereas in his time as mayor, [ORGANIZATION] has championed smart growth for our city, police accountability, equity, opportunities for youth, and an aggressive agenda combating the effects of climate change. And whereas no [ORGANIZATION] mayor has done more to address housing affordability and homelessness, issuing the city's first state of emergency that rapidly opened hundreds of new temporary shelter beds, implemented innovative new livability pilot, I'm sorry, this is long, pilot programs dedicated over half a billion dollars towards affordable housing, and permanently housed 1,294 veterans as the first [ORGANIZATION] city to meet the [ORGANIZATION] mandate."
12_21_2016,homelessness,"Mayor's challenge to end veteran homelessness. And whereas he has led [ORGANIZATION] during a burst of activity, the [ORGANIZATION] comp plan, the deconstruction of older homes, energy benchmarking, and prohibiting bulk fossil fuel facilities, culminating in a climate action plan that was recently voted best in the world by [ORGANIZATION]. And whereas Mayor [PERSON] has pursued an agenda of police accountability, developed stronger community police relationships with [ORGANIZATION]'s diverse groups.  and passed a new police contract to address a growing police staffing crisis, including new equity and de-escalating training for all officers, resulting in a 50% reduction in police use of force incidents [LOCATION]."
12_21_2016,homelessness,"I've said this to all the interviews about you. You came into office as sort of a planner policy wonk, and you were faced with unprecedented levels of housing and homelessness issues that were top of mind for every [ORGANIZATION]er, and police issues that...  You know, fortunately, through things that largely happened in other cities in this nation, but spilled over into [ORGANIZATION] and still do to [ORGANIZATION]. But issues around running the police bureau, police accountability, police oversight."
11_29_2017,homeless,"All of you are a public servant, and you have a duty of care. Your job is not to make a few people happy, but to balance the interests of many. On one of your campaigns from [ORGANIZATION], it says, work to help homeless individuals and families get off and stay off the streets by providing transitional housing, mental health care, addiction treatment, employment assistance."
11_29_2017,homeless,"Create a new air of openness and...  and accountability at [ORGANIZATION]. Now [ORGANIZATION] you went down with [ORGANIZATION] to [ORGANIZATION] to see the [STREET] they were dealing with the homeless. You were elected as mayor, not serving yet, but [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION]."
11_29_2017,homelessness,"This is [ORGANIZATION]. [LOCATION], residents disturbed by homelessness. Watching out for you, [ORGANIZATION]."
11_29_2017,homeless,"You're telling, cut your budgets 5%. Homeless budget could be cut for other needs. You have priorities versus limited funds."
11_29_2017,homeless,"So then all of a sudden, you turn around, and I know more than what I have time to say here, but it says [ORGANIZATION] hopes to extend homeless emergency [ORGANIZATION]. That happened real soon after he said you were going to cut it. So I watched...  when down there with the small business community, one of your people you sent down there, he's standing there like this."
11_29_2017,homeless; homelessness,"He says, we want to know where the hot spots are. That's the same thing your spokesperson said to me during [ORGANIZATION] after countless emails and pictures of where I live right near what's called a gamer trail where we've got a whole hillside full of homeless women,  They're assaulted. Like I've said to you before, the face of homelessness is a woman with a black eye and a bloody nose."
11_29_2017,homeless,"Good morning. Excuse me. Good morning, and thank you for the progress you have made in housing our homeless, and a special thanks to Commissioner [PERSON] for the amazing work he has done in this area."
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"Authorized conveyance of city-owned property located at [ADDRESS] to [ORGANIZATION] and funding not to exceed $5,600,000 to its affiliate, [ORGANIZATION], for the construction of a new mixed-use affordable housing development located in [ORGANIZATION]. Colleagues, this development with our regional partners at ORG2, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and my office exemplifies a great regional working partnership to accomplish a common goal, which is to increase affordable housing in our community. This project, a 12-floor mixed-use building, will consist of ground floor, commercial and retail space, and 240 multifamily residential units."
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"Additionally, in solidifying our ongoing commitment to creating deeply affordable units, this project will include 20 units serving households at or below 30% median family income. It's my understanding that this property will become the largest affordable housing development built in [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION]. In a time when we see so much divisiveness in government across the country, personally I find it very reassuring that we have local agencies that are working together seamlessly to address our community's needs around housing."
11_29_2017,housing crisis,"These strong relationships help us to do big things for people we serve, and this building is a testament on how we're responding to our housing crisis. [ORGANIZATION] is not a typical housing authority, and I'm very happy that we have a partner with the knowledge, the skills, and the capacity to deliver landmark properties at this scale to our community. To give us some further details on this development opportunity, we have ORG1 Director, [ORGANIZATION], here, as well as [ORGANIZATION]'s Director, [PERSON]."
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"But here's the bottom line. Because the council ultimately decided that all those properties that were in play be transferred to the city, and because the city established clear guidelines for how that money should be spent, we are here [ORGANIZATION] celebrating, as the mayor said, a substantial down payment on affordable housing in our community, rather than completing a [ORGANIZATION] on a luxury hotel. Thank you."
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"But since [ORGANIZATION] came into possession of this site, the streetcar was installed. It became a much more walkable neighborhood. And we saw with great interest what was going on with the adjacent [ORGANIZATION], which contains really no affordable housing whatsoever."
11_29_2017,homelessness; housing crisis,"Immediately after the state of emergency was declared with housing and homelessness, [ORGANIZATION] moved every one of its sites and all of its available money forward in what we call a super [ORGANIZATION], a Notice of Funding Availability. We were all in to help you solve the housing crisis, and our partners responded. [PERSON] was one of two competitors for this site."
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"And as the Mayor said, with 20 project-based vouchers providing deep affordability, as well as three more apartments at 50% affordability. So to be able to increase, significantly increase, the number of affordable apartments and not have to come back to the city for any more money feels like a big victory for all of us and something we're really excited to get in the dirt and start to deliver. And as much as we love doing big projects like this, our role...  is not just as a competitor for city resources, but as a strategic and funding partner with all of you in the larger effort to increase affordable housing in the community."
11_29_2017,homeless; affordable housing,"It's not just necessarily generic, deeply affordable housing. And that's the programming that we have moved forward with. Under what policy?  Because we're picking, I mean, there's dozens of populations that require our, so what's the policy that put domestic violence survivors ahead of, say, formerly homeless people with mental illness or whatever?"
11_29_2017,homeless,I understand capitalizing on an opportunity that arises because there's some funding available. This is not a criticism. What I'm simply pointing out is that the city has committed to add 200 units of permanent supportive housing to address two-thirds of the people who are homeless.
11_29_2017,homelessness,The next one could be veterans homelessness. The next project could be family-friendly housing. They're all important.
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"I think a lot about this. I was in the affordable housing world for [ORGANIZATION] at a not-for-profit before I came to [ORGANIZATION] and take very seriously the idea that we have to be careful stewards of public dollars. So when you look at the total, a whole bunch of financing costs that are in there."
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"You know, I'd also say in the context of affordable housing, I mean, it is the right question. Why is it cost what it costs? You know, [ORGANIZATION] spoke to [ORGANIZATION] affordability."
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"People who need affordable housing often have more than $1,000 in delinquent debt, and to exclude them from eligibility for that reason is unconscionable. Thank you, [ORGANIZATION]. Good morning."
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"So we could have maybe fetched,  one, two million dollars. Instead, now we're looking at a project that's going to provide over 240 units of affordable housing. So I think we made the right decision to hold on to that property, given all its attributes, and as Commissioner [PERSON] said, given it really is..."
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"We talk a lot about building affordable housing in important areas, not just on the outskirts of the city, but high-opportunity areas. Good schools, good transit, good retail. And this...  FAC0 has it all, and now it's going to be an outstanding home to hundreds of people."
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"So I think my colleagues have probably covered most of the bases. I just want to say this is an exciting and significant step forward in meeting our shortfall of affordable housing, and I'm pleased to vote aye. PERSON0."
11_29_2017,houseless,"It's just not a good [STREET] to access communities at risk. access communities that have undocumented children or parents, access communities of color, marginalized community members that are houseless, people with disabilities who all see these officers as dangerous to their status, their lives, their children, their homes, everything. For them to be showing up in uniform in these cars,  under what premise, how much are they being paid?"
11_29_2017,homeless,The ordinance is adopted. Please call item [DATE]. Amend ORG0 with [LOCATION] to provide revised [ORGANIZATION] budget allocation to [ORGANIZATION].
11_29_2017,homeless,"Colleagues, in brief, this action improves...  approves the funding [ORGANIZATION] has already approved in the budget and the fall bump for [ORGANIZATION]. It realigns the federal funding allocation and incorporates the funding passed by the ORG2 in the fall bump. [ORGANIZATION]'s here to answer any questions you have about this."
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"Very good. I would definitely agree with you on that particular project and looking at some of the record behind it. And also, it's an example of how...  public and private sector can engage in projects that increase the opportunity for affordable housing within the inner city of [ORGANIZATION]."
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"And they're not only valuable now, and some of the reasons for that are those places set the mood and the character in areas of our city. They encourage tourism and affordable housing in some cases. But they're also valuable later and future."
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"Well, I appreciate the list you've given us because there's some incentives, some deferrals. [ORGANIZATION] has a lot of experience with that revolving loan, but that only covers 15% of the city, and so it is not broad enough. we have a related challenge, which is of those 1,500 buildings that are currently being looked at, there's a chunk of them that are affordable housing developments that need to be updated, and the funding is not in their pro forma."
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"And, you know, looking at that in the [ORGANIZATION] budget because it's been –  [LOCATION], and it's obviously a great concern among the community. I think... I'm very, very interested in the conversation about how we balance preserving historic buildings and historic neighborhoods and how we balance that with the need for more density and more affordable housing."
11_29_2017,homelessness,"And then, of course, the whole [ORGANIZATION] conversation, which is one of the, I think,  homelessness, parking, and unreinforced masonry buildings may be the most controversial issues that I've faced in [ORGANIZATION] here. And I don't know, I was Googling this while you were talking about financing, and you may have already articulated, did you talk about our ORG1 program? No."
11_29_2017,housing crisis; affordable housing,There is an affordable housing crisis. We recognize all of these things and... And I think we'd really like to be a part of the solution.
11_29_2017,housing crisis,"And parking. And the whole cost-benefit analysis from a public perspective, that if you're expending public funds on historic preservation, is that justified when we're in the midst of a housing crisis? Yes."
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"I was most, many of the things I was going to say you've already discussed among yourselves already, which is very reassuring to me. One of them being the incentives, and I certainly support the idea of, you know, continuing to  house, an arts group, but I'm wondering if that same strategy couldn't be used to create or keep affordable housing in those unreinforced masonry structures if a covenant couldn't be made in some cases where there would be a certain level of rent for X number of [ORGANIZATION] in return for some subsidy or revolving loan for the seismic reinforcement. Because I'm obviously aware of the financial tradeoffs."
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"And that's just not fair. And there needs to be some [STREET] that we can do some bridge building, some better understanding of what's going on here between the...  the need for affordable housing and the need for some kind of preservation. And if there's anything I can do to help, I will, but somehow there needs to be some higher level of leadership convening this."
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"We'd like to see better incentives to retain existing housing, most of which is our more affordable housing. And we'd like to see additional provisions that ensure the compatibility of infill development and so forth. Okay."
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"We need a demolition by neglect ordinance in this town. Many cities, including [ORGANIZATION], use this mechanism to help ensure public safety and prevent the loss of historic resources. If one had been in [STREET] in [PERSON], we might not have experienced the outrageous loss of the FAC0 building, which, by the [STREET], could have been used for affordable housing, despite what the claim of the developer was."
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"As the report recommends, targeting more modest resources and more modest neighborhoods can minimize displacement of vulnerable communities. One such area is, surprisingly, is [ORGANIZATION], densely populated with affordable housing [ORGANIZATION]. Affordable housing and historic preservation should proceed hand in hand."
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"And I suspect it's not appropriate to create them exactly the [STREET] they are [ORGANIZATION], which, again, I will say the council has no role in creating.  applying them directly and I believe that it's appropriate again for the council to make the choices about the designation and whether a resource is worthy to get some of these tax abatements and you know you can consider whether you're achieving your [ORGANIZATION] goals and your affordable housing goals as well as your historic preservation goals when you give a tax abatement."
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"And I'm here [ORGANIZATION] to support the report and the work of the commission and staff. It was very nicely done and great work over [LOCATION]. Also, I want to be here to say historic preservation and affordable housing can go hand in hand."
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"In some of the buildings you've done that are in historic buildings,  properties or unreinforced masonry buildings. The city financed those projects knowing that the buildings had issues. If we're going to come along [ORGANIZATION] and set a mandate and we're talking about a community asset that is affordable housing, social housing that is serving our lowest income residents, I think the city has to have some skin in the game."
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"I have personally two [ORGANIZATION] properties. They're both basement conversions, and they rent for $8.95 a month. And so that's affordable housing."
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"Specifically, I think in this report, the question of unreinforced masonry buildings and affordable housing, yes, these are preservation issues and it's appropriate to think about and address them in that [STREET]. But as the discussion has gone on [ORGANIZATION], we all realize that there's broader concerns. I think that this report and [ORGANIZATION] approach to bringing all that in is very thoughtful and certainly one to be commended and one we can support."
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"The first is a request to increase...  the amount of floor area that a project earning a central city and inclusionary housing bonus, a commercial project, an office building, can earn in response to concerns that the cost per square foot in our current inclusionary housing program is high enough that it's going to discourage use of the bonus. And the result of that would be that whereas we would just get less resources in for affordable housing through the bonus if the bonus isn't used, and secondly, we run the risk of having central city buildings underbuilt. [ORGANIZATION] put a fee of $24 a square foot on it."
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"The money that's raised by this goes into the affordable housing fund. We're proposing instead of one square foot for $24, we amend the zoning code in this case for an interim period, [ORGANIZATION] is what we're proposing, and make it one and a half square feet for $24. The impact of that is right to reduce the effective cost per square foot for a commercial building."
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"My recollection is that we wanted to create a slight disincentive from people using fee-in-lieu because we thought that the actual –  on-site affordable housing component, particularly in the central city, was preferable. Could you respond? Yeah, you're absolutely correct."
10_03_2018,homelessness,"Communications. Item [DATE], a request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel regarding the petition for a compassionate response to homelessness. I had a question."
10_03_2018,homelessness,"Thank you, [ORGANIZATION]. Sure. [DATE], request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding criminalization of homelessness."
10_03_2018,homelessness,"[DATE], request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding commentary from [STREET] routes.  [DATE], request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel regarding compassionate response to homelessness. And [DATE], request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel regarding compassionate response to homelessness.  Very good. Good morning."
10_03_2018,homeless; homelessness,"I want to first start out by...  recognizing the tragic death of [ORGANIZATION] in our city. And [ORGANIZATION] we're here to bring to you a petition co-sponsored by community activists, religious leaders, civil rights organizations, academics, lawyers, homeless advocates, and one city council candidate. In addition, more than 4,000 individuals from across [ORGANIZATION] have signed on to this petition, which very simply asks that we change our strategy for addressing homelessness.  from one which has resulted in over 53% of arrests being of homeless people, to one which actually tries to solve the problems facing them, including lack of housing, mental health and addiction services, and basic hygiene for people living on the streets."
10_03_2018,affordable housing,"While we realize that creating affordable housing is a long-term effort, what we are asking can be implemented immediately or in the near future. Number one, develop a robust group of first responders who are trained to deal with mental health and addiction crises who would be the ones to connect people living on the streets with services. These first responders could also address the livability issues like needles in parks, garbage in neighborhoods, and low-level theft if victims did not want to involve the police."
10_03_2018,homeless; housing crisis,"Two, declare a moratorium on sweeps of homeless camps. Until we can offer adequate alternatives, sweeping people from one part of the city to another part of the city is an expensive and harmful [STREET] to deal with the housing crisis. Number three, provide basic services for hygiene for people living on the [STREET], including restrooms, water, and garbage disposal."
10_03_2018,homeless,"There are already successful examples of city-sanctioned camps, so let's expand this model. And five, track arrests of homeless people, publish data on a city website, and hold responsible parties accountable for achieving a drastic reduction of arrests. We should not have to rely on the investigative journalism of the [ORGANIZATION] to learn basic facts about how the city deals with its homeless population."
10_03_2018,homelessness,So we're asking that city council use such discretion again to stop arresting people living on the streets for low-level offenses. While reasonable people can disagree about the most effective ways to address the crisis of homelessness...  We must all affirm the dignity and humanity of people living on the streets. The recent vigilante actions by Portlanders who videotape and photograph people entering a needle exchange program is a dangerous descent into mob dehumanization of our most vulnerable neighbors.
10_03_2018,homeless,So I call on the mayor and city council to stop mass incarceration of homeless people and to speak out against the dangerous anti-homeless vigilante actions. Thank you. Thank you.
10_03_2018,homeless,"I was homeless, addicted, and they arrested me and took me to [PERSON], and they let me out immediately. And with the charges that I was arrested for, I would have been sent to prison in [PERSON]. After going to jail so many times, Judge [PERSON], I got arrested for selling $5 worth of crack to an undercover cop."
10_03_2018,affordable housing,Thank you. I live in affordable housing at FAC0 down on FAC1 across from the immigration office. I have mental health issues.
10_03_2018,homeless,"Good morning. [TIME]. Hi, my name is [ORGANIZATION], and I'm also a [STREET] roots vendor and homeless advocate."
10_03_2018,homeless,"Yeah, so I'm clean and sober, been clean and sober since [ORGANIZATION] when I started my advocacy. That's right. But being clean and sober, I'm also being victimized by the police, by the community, because everybody thinks all homeless people are drunks, druggies, and mentally ill."
10_03_2018,affordable housing,"I'm neither one of those. And there was a lot of, when I first started my advocacy, like within [ORGANIZATION], I had elected officials, church leaders, even people, all these influential people, even people in affordable housing, trying to get me into affordable housing, but couldn't get me in there because... I was clean and sober."
10_03_2018,homeless; homelessness,"I wasn't a drunk, a druggie, or mentally ill. So there's a lot of homeless people out there, what I call the functional homeless people, that can't get inside but are being victimized by the [STREET] people are thinking of homelessness. When you talk about the mental illness, there's a lot of sleep deprivation out there, which...  can be thought of as mental illness, but it's not."
10_03_2018,homeless; affordable housing,"It takes [ORGANIZATION] for that to happen. So what you're basically telling people when you say, I'm all about affordable housing, is wait, homeless people, wait for [ORGANIZATION] until we get enough affordable housing. Sometimes we don't hit that mark, and you have to wait a little bit longer."
10_03_2018,homeless,"And if you're clean and sober, you have to wait a little bit longer than that. You're being victimized out there all this time because of the [STREET] people think, which is really, really bad on homeless people when they're trying to help themselves, they're trying to pick themselves on up, but yet we have non-homeless people that come on over and tell us that we're mentally ill, we're lazy, that we don't want to get a job, we're unkept, things like that. Yet it's the [STREET] the people have put homeless people through this stuff."
10_03_2018,affordable housing,"You know, in most places you can't do that. So, yeah, that's what we need is more right-to-dream tools, tent cities, and shelters for a temporary solution until we have enough affordable housing. Because me, I am traumatized by all of this stuff."
10_03_2018,homeless,"You know, I might not show it, but, yeah, I've been victimized many times out there. And there are a lot of homeless people out there because of the mindset people put in people's minds, not homeless people's minds."
10_03_2018,homeless,"You don't have it in front of you, but the clerk has it. One is a recent press release about the related issue of business improvement districts, and it has some policy recommendations, and then also a recent report that provides practical guidance for authorized homeless encampments. That's from [ORGANIZATION]."
10_03_2018,homelessness,"Although we're here asking you for policy changes at the outset, I don't want you to think that we're saying that you aren't trying or the city hasn't taken steps to try to address these issues. I've heard from each of you about things the city has done, and we thank you for those things. At the same time, there's also things that are operating in our policies and our systems that are both causing harm and not helping to alleviate homelessness, and that are also diverting resources from solutions that would help."
10_03_2018,homeless; houseless,"More specifically, those things that are causing harm and diverting our resources are the repeated displacement of people who have no safe [STREET] to go, repeated police contact for people who have experienced trauma, and criminal justice system involvement for people who truly just need services and a [STREET] to safely sleep. As long as over 50% of arrests in the city are of homeless, are of our houseless neighbors, there's something fundamentally wrong with our policies and systems that we have put in [STREET] to address this emergency. This situation with massive numbers of our friends and neighbors without housing and without safety truly is a state of emergency."
10_03_2018,homelessness,"I have personally spoken with a variety of folks in law enforcement on this issue, from officers to representatives of the police union,  to folks higher up in the chain, and those conversations lead me to believe that many in law enforcement also believe that more police is not the solution to addressing homelessness. We have set up a system where it is somehow law enforcement's responsibility to fix this problem, but they literally can't fix it. More policing, more sweeps, more identification checks, which I still am getting reports about happening, those things are not going to help."
10_03_2018,homeless,"My colleagues worked really hard to put this all together. Over 4,000 people signed our petition so far once the Oregonian report came out that over half of the arrests [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION] were of homeless people. It seems like [LOCATION] we were here arguing against adding more police in [DATE]."
10_03_2018,homeless,"We said that we did not want this additional money going to new police officers because we anticipated that that would affect our homeless population negatively. It feels like [ORGANIZATION] that we were here arguing that increased police staffing would not improve livability overall in [ORGANIZATION], and later we were vindicated by the [ORGANIZATION] report. But the homeless population and their advocates argued that  The additional police staffing would negatively impact their lives through the profiling, harassment, and sweeps they experience."
10_03_2018,homelessness,"Meanwhile, neighborhood groups following in many ways the lead of the decisions made by this council are coalescing in places like [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], and you'll even see people from [PERSON] potentially here [TIME] saying they also want more policing around urban livability issues. But this isn't really about livability. This is about excluding people experiencing homelessness, homelessness.  from the public eye, from neighborhoods, from communities."
10_03_2018,homeless,"And as we've clearly demonstrated [ORGANIZATION], additional police are not making our homeless people safer. Thank you. What we need to think about is are we going to make [ORGANIZATION] a [STREET] that feels safe for elites, for business class?"
10_03_2018,homeless,"You may be surprised to hear that I agree with much, in fact, the vast majority of everything that you've just said. First of all, let me say...  that I agree wholeheartedly that the police are being put into a nearly impossible situation. They are, along with other first responders, fire EMTs, they are now the first responders to a homeless crisis that I think most of us now acknowledge as a crisis."
10_03_2018,homeless,"And the budget that this council adopted...  [ORGANIZATION] actually has three more data analysts, and it focused on issues around public safety in particular, and this is an important part of that data collection effort. I want to tell you that it is current police policy that we do not arrest people for being homeless. There is no policy that would support arresting somebody because they are homeless."
10_03_2018,homelessness,"There's, of course, the [ORGANIZATION] petition that I will be in receipt of shortly, and I hope to talk with the people about that.  of [ORGANIZATION] who I think share many, if not all, of your views with regard to this. Not to be confused by the [ORGANIZATION] petition I received [ORGANIZATION] saying that we were too soft.  on issues around homelessness and criminality and livability. It has been my objective to separate these issues, have a compassionate, effective, data-driven approach around homelessness that includes prevention."
10_03_2018,homelessness,"And I was very encouraged when I met with mayors from all around the state  on [ORGANIZATION] at [ORGANIZATION] down in [ORGANIZATION], and our only subject of conversation for [PERSON] was homelessness, we talked about where are the points of commonality and agreement that we can get behind and support? Because...  I've got to tell you, if [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION] can't figure out how to get out of this situation with regard to homelessness and poverty and income inequality and mental health and addiction issues that are going untreated and a lack of housing, if we cannot figure out how to get out of this box together, it doesn't paint a very hopeful picture for anywhere else. We can do it."
10_03_2018,homeless,"It was a stark contrast between the panel we had, between this panel and the panel we had [ORGANIZATION] from a particular neighborhood who started with a laundry list of complaints about the homeless, did not offer any compassion, let alone solutions, and ended with telling us we were making it too hard to be landlords in this city. Thank you. Mayor was surprised I didn't jump in on that, but I really honestly felt like it would be an exercise in futility because there's just such a lack of understanding in the broader community about the forces that have brought us to where we are [LOCATION]."
10_03_2018,homelessness,"There's a 96% correlation between housing affordability and homelessness. So anyone who wants to tell me that we're making it too hard to be a landlord or that regulating our rental market is not going to help this crisis doesn't know what they're talking about, frankly. I agree with all of your solutions."
10_03_2018,homelessness,"I also agree that more police is not going to remedy the problem. livability issues that people associate with homelessness, which is really the only justification I was hearing for the increase. I didn't want the increase."
10_03_2018,affordable housing,"I appreciate what [ORGANIZATION] said about [ORGANIZATION], and it reminded me of how offensive it was [ORGANIZATION] at a public forum when someone who was opposing 26-199 said it would lead to the creation of ghettos. Now, the logic of that is that if you invest in affordable housing, you're creating ghettos, ghettos like [ORGANIZATION]. So I was pleased, [ORGANIZATION], that you pointed out that in terms of just raw percentage, we have more affordable housing in the [PERSON] than any other part of our city, and we should not be using words like loaded terms like ghettos to describe providing affordable housing for working families."
10_03_2018,homeless,"now, and then later had to cost overrun and ended up grabbing some more expensive money at the back end. Plus, there's the whole beauty of having a 90,000 building remodel going on while thousands of people are sleeping outside, and we don't have any large funded homeless shelters. But, of course, this item is only about the financial precision to possibly pay down the principal with the principal, so we don't pay interest or something like that."
10_03_2018,homeless,"In [ORGANIZATION] and $500 million, it may be upgraded. Yet [PERSON] market and homeless programs take [STREET] under the bridge, and there is no evidence that the city has concern to warn. To placard one building type is the equivalent to spot zoning."
10_03_2018,affordable housing,"So if you do that... And I think this would...  go over into other things. You know, old brick buildings have lower rentals, and we're talking about affordable housing?"
10_03_2018,affordable housing,"You might be losing a whole bunch of affordable housing with what you're doing. So you need a whole larger economic impact study to really know what's being affected, and that's before this is...  Don't do it. Thank you."
12_15_2016,affordable housing,"And we're trying to create all sorts of affordable housing opportunities in what we call high-opportunity areas, areas that are good neighborhoods, good schools, good parks. And you're in essence telling me that if you live there now, you're forever somehow vested. And if you're new, you're out of luck."
12_15_2016,affordable housing,"But this is better late than never, I think, and I'm hopeful that this policy will help keep some oil in the ground and will help provide eventually for more affordable housing and provide a foundation for more sustainable policies and developments. At least until social and technological developments make this less of an issue for our city, and maybe in [ORGANIZATION] when we maybe have less demand for on-[STREET] parking. I think this right now program sends a message to developers."
12_15_2016,affordable housing,"I think that when we talk about equity and people, I mean, there is a large group of people in this city who can't afford cars. And when I ride the bus, that's a lot  a lot of who's on the bus with me. So I think when we talk about who's really the vulnerable members of our society and who's affected by this policy, you know, we're not collecting money and extending...  try and extend bus [TIME] or make it possible to build more affordable housing near where their jobs are, we're focusing on a car-dependent system that, as we saw [ORGANIZATION], really doesn't serve people in a lot of circumstances."
12_15_2016,affordable housing,"When we were here [ORGANIZATION] asking for parking minimums, the reaction from council was, gee, we're looking into reexamining them elsewhere in the city. We don't want to adopt something [ORGANIZATION] and then undo it. Well, now that you've made your decision about the rest of the city, which is very much what we wanted, which is having parking minimums but exempting affordable housing units and projects, we would like to put us on the same wavelength as the rest of the city."
10_11_2018,houseless,"Thank you. [ORGANIZATION] awarded $6,500 to ORG1 for their ambassador project, hosting writing and art workshops for housed and houseless people to create together, culminating in the second DATE0 Light the Hearth Festival. The DATE1 ORG2 received $5,250 so that young people aged [ORGANIZATION] could express themselves by creating original music, culminating in a live community performance at ORG3."
10_11_2018,affordable housing,"There's much work to be done, and there are many voices that need to be heard and be at the table, if you will. I end my time with three voices from those who responded to my questionnaire on affordable art spaces in [ORGANIZATION], whose statistical findings will be published by [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] has been fortunate in its ability to draw young talent for [LOCATION], but without affordable housing and studio space."
10_11_2018,affordable housing,"If the goal is to keep artists in [ORGANIZATION], I feel that talks about affordable art space have to include talks about affordable housing, living wages, and affordability issues. and utilities of other necessities. Non-diverse arts-dependent businesses and non-profits also need to examine the ways in which they exclude people from historically marginalized groups and commit to inclusion."
10_11_2018,affordable housing,"I'm looking at your help, [ORGANIZATION], to really do this paradigm shift, where I think we've gotten really used to thinking about art as an object that we collect and we take care of as stewards. But in [ORGANIZATION], we've shifted away from that. And I think really why we keep asking for affordable housing, affordable food, affordable transportation, is that for us to make things that look like art and culture, we need to thrive first."
10_11_2018,affordable housing,"The thing that angers them the most is the notion that government is deciding what's best for them, whether it's in your womb or in your tax book, your checkbook. So I would urge you to really...  Stop playing these games because it may backfire. It may not backfire on the arts tax, but it may backfire on the next city affordable housing bond measure or the next iteration of the children's levy where voters feel so frustrated that what they say in writing doesn't seem to be reflected in what happens in fact, and they take it out on us."
10_11_2018,housing crisis; affordable housing,"The second area, and I'll just make it second and third area and combine the two things because they're closely related, which is affordable housing and affordable art space. And while we didn't really talk about our housing strategy or the work that we're doing around affordable and workforce housing, that obviously is critical to this. And we saw that lesson from our friends down in [ORGANIZATION], that as the cost of housing swamped their supply at a much faster rate than what's happened even here in [PERSON], we saw that their arts and their culture and even their hospitality, their culture,  their restaurant culture, their culinary culture, all of those things came under significant stress as a result of the housing crisis they experienced there."
12_30_2015,homelessness,"Okay, then let's move to communications, please. Item [DATE]. [DATE], request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding homelessness in [ORGANIZATION]."
12_30_2015,homeless; homelessness,"As you know, [ORGANIZATION] and many other places are in a state of emergency regarding housing and homelessness, which at least in part is the result of the corporatization of our society and the concentration of wealth in the top 1%. Too many corporations pay their employees less than a living wage, send jobs overseas, don't contribute their fair share of taxes to our society, and all after using our public coffers for their specific infrastructure needs. Not only are homeless, but our schools and our roads testify to this state of affairs."
12_30_2015,homelessness,"As more and more ordinary, hardworking people find it impossible to pay the exorbitant rents in our cities, I predict that the homelessness problem will only grow and intensify a tragic result of national policy. There are a few measures that I feel... PERSON0 can take, and you may already be considering some of these."
12_30_2015,affordable housing,"I would really love to see an ongoing city policy whereby rental buildings of more than 10 units are required, ongoingly, to reserve 30% of their units as being affordable housing. And this can be subsidized with taxes on things like takeout meals or other non-essential goods. I would also like to see a really high tax rate on developers building these outsized [ORGANIZATION]-type homes because they just [STREET] up the prices of homes in the city."
12_30_2015,affordable housing,"And if that $25,000 demolition tax can be reconfigured, that could also help to go towards affordable housing. The other thing I would love to see [ORGANIZATION] do, [PERSON] and GPE2 are the only two states that do not allow inclusionary zoning. And I would really like to see that ban repealed."
12_30_2015,homeless,"Do not expect the taxpayers to pay for that.  for them and to respect the rights of humans in the larger environment. You know, if they want to come here and take advantage of the community, we really don't want them here. And anything less than maintaining these values will result in the many tents we see outside and the many more homeless people we don't see living in their cars or doubling up with relatives."
09_24_2015,homeless,"We believe that the $90 ticket currently issued is punitive enough to deter repeat offenses and yet reasonable enough so as not to deter people from coming back to the district. Additionally, I'd like to thank you for declaring a state of emergency for housing the homeless in [ORGANIZATION]. We're excited to see more beds become available for those in need."
09_24_2015,homeless,I do ask that you please also address the other piece of the puzzle by establishing enforceable laws to curb nuisance behavior by those on the [STREET]. We are truly hoping that this state of emergency will help homeless people as well as local business. Thank you very much.
09_24_2015,homeless,"People are dying. Homeless folks are trying to get into housing, okay, some of these areas. They're leaving that housing because of the noise, and they're going back on the [STREET]."
09_24_2015,homeless,"These are many of the same people that [ORGANIZATION] already serves. Older adults, our homeless population, people of color, and low-income community members. This is true all across the country, where low-income people and people of color often face the worst exposure to the negative impacts of fossil fuels."
09_24_2015,houseless,"I'm a parent, and I'm a resident of [ORGANIZATION]. I also work with people living outside as a [STREET] librarian with a very small local nonprofit organization. I care deeply about climate change, and I see how climate change is already affecting houseless people."
11_28_2018,affordable housing,"It's being jammed up with housing, but none of it affordable. It's all market rate. And this could have been a great catalyst for affordable housing to put this trail in."
11_28_2018,affordable housing,"It was not made by the community to explore the idea of how transportation can work, how affordable housing can work with it. So it's down the [STREET], I guess. Right now, we are talking about, there is a study going on by [ORGANIZATION] to do a high-speed rail corridor between [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON], GPE2"
11_28_2018,homeless,"Thank you. Next individual, please, [ORGANIZATION].  Item [DATE], request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel on public safety concerns regarding homeless people. Is PERSON2 here?"
11_28_2018,affordable housing,"He understands the challenges of accommodating density and ensuring affordable housing, as well as ensuring proper stewardship of our historic resources, and he's looking forward to engaging with fellow commissioners and others to address these important issues. A quote from [ORGANIZATION] that caught my attention, quote, there is a balance that needs to be found between preservation and progress. They are not mutually exclusive, unquote."
11_28_2018,homeless,"and she's not anymore or whether she's never been affiliated with the [INSTITUTION]. So that's a question for anybody who's on an independent police review, because a lot of times you have them skewing towards the [INSTITUTION] unfairly. And I particularly want to say in regards to homeless people, disabled people, elderly people, people who are..."
11_28_2018,homeless,"There's a lot of police harassment also on the [ORGANIZATION]. In certain areas, there's some dragnet areas down by...  like the bus depot, [ORGANIZATION], and over by FAC0 where they have the dining sisters of the [STREET], and they'll harass people down there. So I'm wondering how she's going to deal with people who are homeless and are through no fault of their own, through a lot of, you know, poor...  service problems that we're having in [ORGANIZATION] for the homeless, how she's going to deal with that when those people are dealt with unfairly."
11_12_2015,homelessness; affordable housing,"Now, if you have done that in the past and you've been denied, I don't think that's a good direction to go. Now, one of the biggest concerns I have on this is, Mayor [PERSON], you have declared [ORGANIZATION] a state of emergency in housing. As you know, the [ORGANIZATION] grant is obviously very concerned about affordable housing and homelessness."
11_12_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"Actually, I appreciate [ORGANIZATION] bringing this up. I'm trying to be concise [TIME], but [ORGANIZATION] looks not just at shocks, which are sort of those sudden events like floods and earthquakes that we often think about, particularly with emergency management, but also at chronic stresses, which diminish our resilience over time and also make people very vulnerable sometimes.  to even small floods, for instance. And so the application actually does talk a great deal about the affordable housing crisis and that being the greatest stress that threatens our city resilience."
11_12_2015,affordable housing,"My hope is that if we fill this position, they will be able to channel some of the energy to do something about earthquake preparedness to connect those folks with people working on affordable housing, because I do see them as related. How many times have we applied for this? Twice."
11_12_2015,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION], we're wishing you luck on this one. First thing that I encountered when I was elected in [ORGANIZATION] was a [DATE] storm that was coming our [STREET] and a very disjointed system for dealing with homeless individuals and families that were on the streets. It was your bureau and [PERSON] in particular who called together all of the players and hammered out a written plan and educated us about things like incident commander and [ORGANIZATION] and all the various components of a plan."
11_12_2015,homelessness,Hi.  [ORGANIZATION] thank you all it was a good process and we've gotten to a good result i i'm very heartened by our continued commitment to housing and homelessness every chance that this council gets to do the right thing on housing and homelessness we have been and that's great  We also need to just make sure we understand that we're going to be in some difficult budget choices in the near future because of the commitments that we've made. I'm happy to have that problem because I like the commitments. I also just want to continue to flag the concern I have about the police bureau and overtime.
11_12_2015,affordable housing,"And you are charged, of course, with caring for the welfare of people. the welfare of people and the commons. And that caring for that people, you have already exhibited affordable housing, $15 an hour."
11_12_2015,affordable housing,"You say that's important. And within this responsibility, especially those groups that you have responded to in affordable housing and in $15 an hour are the marginalized. Those are the people, ultimately, we should care for first."
10_16_2019,houseless,"Who is going to be counting people who are houseless in our community? Thank you so much for asking. So actually, you know, there are some communities that we do not provide forms for, and houseless folks would be in that demographic."
10_16_2019,houseless,"Indigenous people, Native people, tribal people will also be enumerated in person. And so [ORGANIZATION] will send someone out, to places where they understand houseless people to be and they will count them in person there. Let me just say that they're not going to have a lot of success because people who are houseless don't talk to people who say I'm from the government and I'm here to help."
10_16_2019,houseless,"It would really be important to partner with organizations who already have a relationship with folks who are houseless. So I, and quite frankly, you will find in the population of people who are houseless, the hard to count population that we say that we're targeting. So I would hope that you would add one or two organizations that actually have a relationship with folks who are houseless as part of the team."
10_16_2019,houseless,"That's right. Commissioner [PERSON]. PERSON1, could you explain? explain what you meant by not having forms for the houseless population?"
10_16_2019,houseless,Right. Houseless people are not included in the hard to count traditional bucket at all because they would not have homes. It's based on the 76% response rate.
10_16_2019,houseless,"You can register someone to vote who's in a county jail. You can register people to vote using community services as their address for them to pick up their ballot. And so what I'm trying to understand is, What case would you make to someone who is houseless?"
10_16_2019,homeless,"It's vital statistics. But it is so profoundly important and we, you know, this particular census is so fraught. I'm very interested in this issue around the homeless count because we struggle as a city to get an accurate count of our own homeless population."
10_16_2019,housing crisis,We have low high school graduation. We have a statewide housing crisis. And it's just vitally important that we count.
10_16_2019,houseless,"Right. I want to know, you know, [ORGANIZATION], they're doing a horrible job with FAC0. Everyone who's houseless hates FAC0."
10_16_2019,houseless,We are talking about counting people so that we can get the resources. I would say hire houseless people to count the houseless. I think that's a great idea.
10_16_2019,homeless; homelessness,"They said on that list of five, you would have thought the hard to count would have definitely been the homeless community without any doubt. We're in a state of emergency. And the main thing from the city, the county, the state is to focus on the homelessness and the homeless themselves on making sure they step up and they do the census survey."
10_16_2019,homeless,"And I'm proposing that what we do for the homeless community is that if we can do this by law and that'll need to be checked, we offer to pay them $20. You step forward and you do this, you receive $20 for participating. Now look at what Commissioner [PERSON] stated."
10_16_2019,homeless,"Commissioner [PERSON]. So you've heard a strong interest from the council and from public testimony in this issue around counting our homeless population. And as you explained, it's somewhat prescribed by the federal government."
10_16_2019,affordable housing,"This is a pressing need for renters with disabilities, older renters, and low-income renters, people of color, and many others. Right now, in this city, it's nearly impossible to find accessible, affordable housing, but an inclusive rental registry could change that for the better. The disability community needs this to keep us out of medical facilities, institutions, and off the streets, because that's where people with disabilities end up when they can't find appropriate housing."
10_16_2019,homeless,"So, Mayor, I'm pleased as part of our overall response to this homeless crisis that we're investing. in the new [ORGANIZATION], which will be located in [ORGANIZATION]. Thank you to my colleagues for the conversations we've had."
10_16_2019,houseless,"We have a significant increase in 911 calls that have absolutely nothing to do with fire or crime or anything like that. We have a lot of calls to 911 that are all about people that people would rather not see, our houseless population. I can tell you that I don't know how those fire engines make it to many corners of the city of [ORGANIZATION], but they do."
10_16_2019,affordable housing,"He has demonstrated the ability to make safe communities in the past. He continues his commitment by following the code, the rule of the code in enhancing the community. While I support dense... population and affordable housing."
11_09_2016,houseless,"A request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding report on the state of houseless situation from service provision point of view. Come on up, please. Good morning."
11_09_2016,houseless,"My name's Ree. Boots on the ground, [ORGANIZATION]. I'm going to call this communique the true state of the houseless address."
11_09_2016,houseless,"We have been involved in many projects concerning the houseless, everything from [ORGANIZATION], [DATE] water sweeps. I'm going to give the city a D instead of an F as far as houseless go, because we were able to change the paradigm that sweeps had, the [STREET] sweeps happened. They're not brutal, horrible things anymore."
11_09_2016,houseless,"Okay, if that were the case, all of [ORGANIZATION] would have woke up dead [TIME]. That's not a thing. We owe an obligation to the houseless community."
11_09_2016,houseless,"Now, towards that end, the entire teeth and guts have been taken out of the houseless initiative team. To my knowledge, there's one person left. One."
11_09_2016,houseless,"You don't have to like it. We need you to do your jobs. And that is to serve the disenfranchised, are sick, are ill, are houseless."
11_09_2016,houseless,I do it all the time. You guys see me before it. I'm here to speak for the voiceless and the houseless.
11_09_2016,homeless,"So first off, I just want to address, you know, everyone's all but heard about PERSON0 becoming president. And you're talking about the refugee crisis and all this stuff. Well, what about all the economic refugees we got in our own community, all the homeless people and all this?"
11_09_2016,affordable housing,"And you're right, it is complicated, a lot of factors to weigh. But we have this new discipline, which we just actually used [ORGANIZATION], of these gator sessions, that is government accountability through transparency and results, led by our independent budget office staff. And we've looked into a couple of issues like sidewalk paving and building permits for affordable housing and then police staffing."
11_09_2016,affordable housing,"Mr. [PERSON]. Thank you, Mayor. This action would be the final step in approving a much-needed affordable housing development in [ORGANIZATION]."
11_09_2016,affordable housing,"The FAC0 project will feature 126 units of affordable housing located between FAC1 and FAC2 along bus lines and the core of [ORGANIZATION]. I believe it's the new FAC3 site, if I'm not mistaken. This project for the [ORGANIZATION] Town Center Urban Renewal Area was made possible through joint actions of [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]."
11_09_2016,affordable housing,"A few [ORGANIZATION] employees got to talking in their hangout down the [STREET], the stars aligned, and a fellow that ran small brewery pints along with his business partners agreed to open a larger operation, [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION]. What we didn't know at the time was how lucky we had gotten and that one of the partners was [PERSON] of ORG2. and in the time he spent in GPE1 center working on the brewery project he quickly saw what we saw in our community he saw a gathering [STREET] a [STREET] where commerce should naturally occur and where people should live work and play our small victory led to advocacy for an action plan which led to a request for interest which led to an ambitious proposal from palindrome communities to restore our town center and before you we have the proposal to provide funding to realize the first phase of a development plan that is really about a true lens revival  PERSON1 and his team have been integral parts of our community since the opening of [ORGANIZATION], and they work to ensure that they are intentionally including us, not just bringing us along, but including us in the anticipated development in every aspect of the project, including making sure that we're keeping space for our neighbors who need affordable housing, but consciously mixing it with market rate housing to ensure that everyone has access to good services and our small businesses are supported."
11_09_2016,affordable housing,"Well, this is really an outstanding public-private partnership to build affordable housing and retail in [ORGANIZATION]. And it's great to see the neighborhood coming here in support of this. And so I just want to recognize the neighborhood, [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, for the tremendous work they've done."
11_09_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,"This will bring on 126 units of deeply affordable housing. And it seems like an appropriate point for me to personally thank [ORGANIZATION] voters [ORGANIZATION] for their outstanding approval of $258 million in general obligation bonds, which we will use to create at least 1,300 units of deeply affordable housing. So I want to thank [ORGANIZATION] voters for recognizing the affordable housing crisis and taking a decisive step to end it."
11_09_2016,houseless,"Thank you. PERSON0, he was houseless, and he was in a neighborhood where someone had actually been helping him take showers so he could get on with his life. PERSON1, also houseless."
11_09_2016,affordable housing,"We've required careful deconstruction of some historic homes, and I hope more soon. And we've worked to expand the affordable rental housing development in our city, like all the projects that will be funded by the bond measure that [ORGANIZATION] passed [ORGANIZATION] that you led, Commissioner [PERSON], and that will put $258 million into the provision of affordable housing in our city. We'll also soon be hearing ORG1 recommendations on inclusionary housing, which they sent to us [ORGANIZATION]."
11_09_2016,affordable housing,"I think it's relatively affordable. I mean, I think that  I mean, I come from an affordable housing background. This is not getting you the affordable housing, except for in very limited ways by some nonprofits that specialize in for-sale neighborhood-based housing."
11_09_2016,affordable housing,"Bring more affordable housing options online for future needs. Eliminate McMansions and encourage the building of smaller houses. Land use decisions made [ORGANIZATION] will directly affect housing abundance, diversity, and affordability."
11_09_2016,affordable housing,"Somebody that just spoke [ORGANIZATION] also is, and who is helping push this proposal through, happens to build the type of housing that would benefit and is also on [ORGANIZATION]. I was appalled to watch them group together and hijack the process and put through a very self-serving agenda and wrap it in the disguise of affordable housing, which it will not create. We all want a suitable and affordable housing, but this proposal will not create affordable housing, and it would increase demolitions and displacement dramatically."
11_09_2016,affordable housing,"The infield proposal creates important housing choices, new important housing choices for Portlanders. Creating more diverse housing options means more type of people can live in our neighborhoods and throughout our city. [TIME], I was able to celebrate the silver lining of the election with a number of you as we passed the affordable housing bond."
11_09_2016,affordable housing,I also would like to see it go farther. I think there are ways that we can support. We have opportunities to directly promote affordable housing in this as well.
11_09_2016,affordable housing,My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I am the [ORGANIZATION] representative on the residential infill project. The assertion that this proposal will provide affordable housing does not hold up to close analysis.
11_09_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,This proposal is simply deregulation that allows the imperfect market to determine the future of our neighborhoods. Analysts have stated that the current reason we have a housing crisis is that we trust in the private market to solve the problem. Increased supply does not lead to more affordable housing.
11_09_2016,affordable housing,A [ORGANIZATION] study states that it will take [ORGANIZATION]...  to produce affordable housing to the first-time homebuyer. Trickle-down economics has failed in the housing market. Duplexes and triplexes are primarily rental housing.
11_09_2016,affordable housing,I'm with [ORGANIZATION]. We're a statewide association of affordable housing and community development nonprofits with 20 members here in the [ORGANIZATION] area. I'm here to express our strong support for this proposal.
11_09_2016,housing crisis,"And our members who are experienced mission-driven nonprofits are eager to help shape this policy as it moves forward to maximize rental and homeownership options in all parts of [ORGANIZATION], not just the centers and corridors. The families our members serve are currently shut out of nearly every neighborhood in [ORGANIZATION]. We need every possible tool to help address [ORGANIZATION]'s housing crisis."
11_09_2016,housing crisis,"We believe that duplexes and garden apartments can absolutely coexist harmoniously with single-family homes, and why not support gentle infill like granny flats? We need all types and all sizes of housing in all price ranges, and this proposal is an important part of the solution to our housing crisis. I also want to express my support personally as someone who's been a homeowner in [ORGANIZATION] since [ORGANIZATION], currently living in the southwest neighborhood of [PERSON]."
11_09_2016,affordable housing,"Nonprofit affordable housing providers, disability rights advocates, home builders, community-based groups, neighborhood associations, and more. My comments [ORGANIZATION] are going to focus on one issue. The residential infill project fills in a significant gap in [ORGANIZATION]'s housing supply by providing smaller housing choices throughout our neighborhoods that are relatively more affordable for more of [ORGANIZATION]'s families."
11_09_2016,affordable housing,"the [ORGANIZATION] proposal delivers family housing in family neighborhoods at a scale that meets the needs of more portlanders you'll also hear that the [ORGANIZATION] proposal will not provide housing affordable to portlanders the economic report commissioned by you shows this to not be true by reducing the scale of new dwellings and allowing more missing middle housing the economic report demonstrates that more affordable housing will be provided and you'll hear that the [ORGANIZATION] should only apply to a narrow band around corridors and centers  [ORGANIZATION] has always provided itself on being a welcoming community for all, and that means adapting to changing families and those of different economic, social, and racial backgrounds. This is not the time to shut some people out of some neighborhoods. The housing decisions you make are for the long term and should not be limited to [ORGANIZATION]'s transit routes, retail nodes, and a [LOCATION] notion of a single-family zone."
11_09_2016,affordable housing,"Housing choices that fall between single-family homes and apartments can also help address the historical inequities of access to self-sufficiency by providing homeownership opportunities. but we know there is still a shortage of housing choices in [ORGANIZATION] currently minimum lot sizes and density limitations constrain the number of homes that can be developed limiting our opportunity to deliver affordable homes by allowing for modest increases in density within the residential zones recommended in the proposal it would open an opportunity not only for [ORGANIZATION] but the market as a whole to provide homes for even more families when it comes to more families  When it comes to housing, every unit really does count. That is why we support the proposals put forth in the residential ORG1 project and see opportunities to further strengthen support for affordable housing development through the proposal."
11_09_2016,affordable housing,"We think it is important to incentivize affordable and accessible homes to reflect the needs of the [ORGANIZATION] community. So we recommend reasonable density bonuses for permanently affordable and accessible units to be added back into the proposal. With these additions, the residential infill proposal can play an important role in providing much-needed affordable housing for our communities."
11_09_2016,affordable housing,"We support changes recommended by [ORGANIZATION] strongly to extend the housing opportunity overlay zone to all residential zones citywide, offer incentives for development of affordable units, promote housing that is adaptable and accessible for people of all ages and mobilities, and what I'm going to talk about more [DATE] is incentivize on-site tree preservation. Carefully crafted zoning code revisions can promote more affordable housing and preserve neighborhood character and also help the city with other worthy goals like tree preservation. The details of how the rules get written matter."
11_09_2016,affordable housing,"My name is [ORGANIZATION], and [ORGANIZATION] when I was president of [ORGANIZATION], I responded to residents' concerns over the growing number of demolitions of single-family homes and the environmental fallout from the demolitions. With the creation of a grassroots organization that we called [ORGANIZATION], the idea was to see if the same concerns were shared by other neighborhoods. And our basic premise in our resolution, preservation of existing affordable housing is a citywide concern, was to see if the same concerns were shared by other neighborhoods.  eventually got endorsed by 43 neighborhoods representing over half the population of the city."
11_09_2016,affordable housing,"So it's compact living. but I get to walk to work. But of those 1,200, 1,300-foot bungalows, they were once upon a time the affordable housing in the neighborhood."
11_09_2016,housing crisis,"Well, I think you had, you know, before the housing crisis, you had a lot of seasoned planners who helped some builders do things really well. We also had an [ORGANIZATION] waiver. Welcome."
11_09_2016,homelessness,"These people don't have a housing choice in this city. by and large what I see is either they go directly into homelessness or they are displaced outside of [ORGANIZATION] they simply can't afford to rent here once they lose their home I don't believe that they have a housing choice  On the other side of my organization, we help people to buy homes. This is largely [ORGANIZATION]'s Hispanic community."
11_09_2016,affordable housing,"Like you said, there haven't been a bunch of duplexes built for all those demolitions. Right. We're concerned about how – I mean, of course we support affordable housing."
11_09_2016,affordable housing,"And [ORGANIZATION] we are still mourning the loss of neighborhoods that were destroyed with good intentions back then. So, yeah, we need to add density, we need affordable housing, but let's make sure that we are doing this in the right [STREET], and let's make sure that these decisions are based on sound evidence, proven results, examples we can look at, see pictures of, and that we respect our heritage and character of these neighborhoods in the process. Thank you."
11_09_2016,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] supports abundant, diverse, and affordable housing options in every neighborhood. We encourage [PERSON] to support ORG2 recommended concepts and policies that will create more missing middle housing in every neighborhood in the city. Currently, [ORGANIZATION]'s housing options are limited and increasingly unaffordable."
11_09_2016,affordable housing,"And recommendation 10, revise parking rules for housing on narrow lots citywide. We believe that there are some areas we can do better. Exempt parking requirements is an incentive for affordable housing units."
11_09_2016,affordable housing,Low-income people are more likely to use transit and not own a car. Infill development that provides affordable housing should be exempt from parking requirements. You should offer parking exemptions for tree preservation.
11_09_2016,affordable housing,"We feel responsibility to those 43 neighborhood associations and neighbors citywide who oppose demolitions, and we can't in good conscience support something that contemplates demolitions at the scale and rate in the proposal. Hundreds of units of affordable housing, well-built and viable housing, crashed into the landfill in this building boom. Many neighborhoods that used to serve a wide range of residents are now only accessible to the wealthy."
11_09_2016,affordable housing,"But the rezoning of this project, even if it's legally defensible, it promises more harm than good and further loss of a desirable resource, which is viable, affordable housing. So I'm going to make the same request of you that I did as others, because you've been so involved in this, and that is three choices. Stop now, do nothing."
11_09_2016,affordable housing,"While keeping the scale of new development consistent with existing houses, it will re-legalize the development of smaller, more energy efficient, and more affordable housing. It will offer options for middle income families that are not currently available. It will allow school teachers, first responders, and shop owners the opportunity to live in the neighborhoods they serve."
10_04_2017,homeless,"None of that is my intentions. I just...  Wanted to point out and have you guys accept the fact that the police was in [ORGANIZATION] responsible for an investigation. And I called and reported the homeless under the building that burned this building down [LOCATION], [DATE]."
10_04_2017,housing crisis,"I'm [PERSON], and I'm an amateur historian right now. Thinking about the housing crisis, I go back to World War II sometimes, where [ORGANIZATION] had the last big housing crisis. 194,000 people came to [PERSON]."
10_04_2017,housing crisis,"150,000 of them working in 85 shipyards. We had a huge housing crisis, and we responded quickly. In [ORGANIZATION], we created [ORGANIZATION]."
10_04_2017,housing crisis,"There was a lot of support back then to increase housing options so people could live, but they didn't apply in single-family zones, Class I residential zones. So it got me curious, what parts of the city have effectively figured out how to not be part of that response to a housing crisis? And so I pulled out the old zoning code map, and you can see on the next page, single-family zoning pre-World War II.  and did a little color by number."
10_04_2017,housing crisis,"Back then, they marked by little dots the single-family areas. And the yellow areas are the areas that were zoned single-family back then. So those are the areas of [ORGANIZATION] that didn't really participate in the first response to a housing crisis."
10_04_2017,homelessness,"Next item, please. The time certain item [DATE], further extend the housing emergency to address continuing homelessness issues, identify council powers, specify an [ORGANIZATION] duration, and waive portions of the zoning code. Colleagues, we're proposing an [ORGANIZATION] extension to the housing emergency that was first declared."
10_04_2017,homelessness; affordable housing,"Since first declaring this state of emergency, we've made significant progress to address the housing and homelessness crisis. We've increased shelter, and the number of unsheltered people sleeping on our streets has decreased. There are 2,200 affordable housing units currently in the pipeline through both an increased funding strategy and streamlining the permitting process."
10_04_2017,homelessness; affordable housing,"We've passed a number of additional tenant protections from inclusionary housing to mandatory DATE0 notice to mandatory relocation assistance. And we're currently finalizing the strategy to construct, acquire, or rehabilitate an additional 1,300 units thanks to the $258 million affordable housing bond voters approved [LOCATION]. But there's more we need to do to stabilize the systems that impact housing and homelessness in our community."
10_04_2017,homelessness,"It's a practical set of land use and regulatory tools that we can use to address both housing and homelessness in our community. This ordinance asks [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] to help us determine criteria which indicates when we can end the housing emergency as well as a plan to get us there. I also want to acknowledge the typo in the FIPIS at the end of the original announcement, which had the incorrect date listed for the extension."
10_04_2017,housing crisis; affordable housing,"DATE0 and over [LOCATION], we are poised to take four important actions to address our housing crisis. I support all of them. Extending the housing state of emergency by DATE2, extending the renter relocation ordinance, developing a roadmap for how we spend the housing bond, and setting a bold vision for boosting the supply of permanent supportive housing.  deeply affordable housing with the services that people experiencing mental health crisis and addiction so desperately need."
10_04_2017,homeless; housing crisis,"and I will push for continued funding for [ORGANIZATION] during our normal budget process. We are not the only city on [ORGANIZATION] experiencing a housing crisis, but we have an opportunity to be a leader in supporting innovative, compassionate, and cost-effective solutions to that crisis. Thank you."
10_04_2017,homelessness,"So thank you, Mayor, and I look forward to the crisis.  extending, but I look forward to the emergency measures we're taking, staying in [STREET]. Very good. With that, we'll introduce [ORGANIZATION] from [ORGANIZATION] in ORG1 and [PERSON], the Director of ORG2."
10_04_2017,homeless,One is the [ORGANIZATION] review by which [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] will review. derive what we think are appropriate metrics to end the housing emergency. This was discussed during our budget process for the DATE1 budget.
10_04_2017,affordable housing,"Now that we're doing the point in time [ORGANIZATION], I think we'll have better data and more frequent data inputs for that purpose. The other thing I'd like to underscore is the value of some of the more subtle aspects of the state of emergency. The process improvements that have been created by working together amongst and across bureaus, [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, and ORG3 especially, to help accelerate the velocity of permit approval for affordable housing projects has been very, very important."
10_04_2017,homeless,I'm PERSON0. I'm the Director of [ORGANIZATION]. I appreciate the opportunity to come and speak a little bit about what we've been able to accomplish thus far under the state of emergency and why we need to continue this.
10_04_2017,homeless; homelessness; housing crisis,"When you first declared the state of emergency [ORGANIZATION], you gave us important tools, financial resources, and critical focus to move forward a set of strategies to address the homeless and housing crisis in our community. Since that time, the city and the county have worked together in an unprecedented [STREET] and in partnership with community-based organizations, advocates, business leaders, philanthropists, and the faith community to expand the resources available to people facing homelessness. With the declaration of the state of emergency, you joined the county to increase total investment in homeless services by 40%, $20 million a year, in addition to the large increases in housing development investments."
10_04_2017,homeless,"With the investments in homeless services and the tools provided by the state of emergency, we've expanded services rapidly. In [ORGANIZATION], we've been able to open and help open six DATE1-round emergency shelters with over 650 beds of capacity. That includes a new 90-bed women's shelter, a new 120-bed shelter for couples and women,  a 30-bed veteran shelter, a new 200-bed shelter for adults that prioritizes women, couples, the elderly, and disabled, a new 14-bed village for women in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood, and a DATE1-round 120-bed shelter for families that also serves several hundred additional people a night with overflow capacity."
10_04_2017,homelessness,"It connects them with the housing, treatment, and employment services they need to avoid being discharged into homelessness. And there's a new housing stabilization team at [ORGANIZATION] that helps their aging and disabled clients avoid losing their housing. As a result of these expanded and new program investments, [ORGANIZATION] we increased the number of people who received prevention assistance by 33% to 6,000 individuals."
10_04_2017,homeless,"All of this is good progress, and yet the housing and homeless crisis continues for low-income people, disabled people, our seniors, and especially for communities of color. The most recent point-in-time count made it clear. While we can appreciate that our unsheltered number was down by 11%, an outcome that defied the trend of double-digit increases up and down [ORGANIZATION], there were still conservatively over 1,600 people entirely unsheltered on [TIME] in [ORGANIZATION] in our community."
10_04_2017,homeless,"And importantly, the overall homeless population continued to grow, nearly 10% over [ORGANIZATION]. And we saw a particularly dramatic increase, about 24%, in the severely disabled long-term homeless population. and over 70% of that chronically homeless population was still unsheltered."
10_04_2017,homeless,"Within this increase, there are other disturbing trends, especially the continued significant overrepresentation of communities of color in the homeless population. Nowhere was this more evident than within the Native American community, which makes up 2.5% of [ORGANIZATION] population and about 10% of the [ORGANIZATION] homeless population. What this data tells us is that while we have made progress on improving shelter access overall, that work is not done."
10_04_2017,homeless; homelessness; affordable housing,"We still have too many highly vulnerable people unsheltered, and we need to fully stabilize the shelter capacity that we've created. And critically, we continue to be in a situation where [ORGANIZATION] more people are becoming homeless and ending up on our streets and in our shelters than are able to escape homelessness. For all the progress we've made on prevention and placement, we need to use the continued declared state of emergency to sustainably improve the ability of our shelters, especially our low-barrier shelters, to help people move out of them and back into permanent housing, to reduce the number of people who are leaving the hospitals, the mental health system, the criminal justice system, and the foster care system, and winding up on our streets, to strengthen the integration of our homeless interventions with mental health, addiction treatment, education, and employment services.  to expand the targeted interventions for communities of color that are overrepresented in the homeless community, to expand our targeted housing and support service interventions for chronically homeless people, including, importantly, the expansion of supportive housing, and finally, to take the financial and regulatory steps to ensure that very low-income households can remain in the housing they have and to increase access to deeply affordable housing units for families and individuals who are homeless DATE1 or become homeless DATE2."
10_04_2017,homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION] will, as directed in the ordinance, work with [ORGANIZATION] over [ORGANIZATION] to articulate the criteria for determining when we no longer find ourselves in a state of emergency with respect to housing and homelessness. But right now, the crisis clearly continues. And extending the declared state of emergency recognizes that we must continue to prioritize the critical work of sustainably expanding and improving our local response to the housing and homelessness crisis."
10_04_2017,homeless,"For the record, my name is [ORGANIZATION]. I am the [ORGANIZATION] Commissioner for [DATE]. And I want to just briefly discuss the work that the county and the city are doing together to expand shelter, streamline homeless services, and get thousands of people into permanent housing."
10_04_2017,homelessness,"I want to acknowledge up front that I think the most important voices we will hear [ORGANIZATION]  are people with lived experience of homelessness or housing instability. Those voices, those experiences, they demand that we respond with care, urgency, and meaningful investment. To that end, over [LOCATION]..."
10_04_2017,homelessness,"Thank you. To that end...  Over [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] has worked closely with [ORGANIZATION] and several community organizations, along with advocates, business leaders, and others, to expand shelter beds, prevent homelessness, and secure permanent housing for individuals and families throughout our community. And...  Though it is clear that people are suffering and we have so much work to do, as [ORGANIZATION] just so eloquently stated, [PERSON] we saw record housing placements and shelter access."
10_04_2017,homeless,"Thousands of people throughout our region got back into housing, found a safer night of sleep, or were kept from becoming homeless in the first [STREET]. But at the same time, we're seeing progress, as [ORGANIZATION] also described. We are also seeing how much work remains to be done."
10_04_2017,homeless; homelessness,"The gap between wages and housing costs continues to widen in [ORGANIZATION], and this pressure is especially acute for our lowest-income residents. What sticks out to me in particular is that our progress on shelter, on housing, and prevention hasn't been experienced equally by all of our [ORGANIZATION] neighbors. The [ORGANIZATION] point-in-time count of homelessness in [ORGANIZATION] tells us that people with disabilities and people who are chronically homeless are making up a larger share of our unsheltered homeless populations than they ever have before."
10_04_2017,housing crisis,It's clear to me that our housing crisis continues to be a true emergency. The action you're considering [ORGANIZATION] will help us respond swiftly and humanely to this crisis. And thank you again for your time.
10_04_2017,homelessness,"When we were regularly pulling families off of our housing choice voucher waiting list, about half of them were leaving homelessness DATE0. We stopped pulling names from our housing choice voucher waiting list. It's frozen for the foreseeable future because our federal funding is not keeping up with the cost of rents."
10_04_2017,homelessness,"this back in [ORGANIZATION], that emergency still exists. It's not done. And we see the urgency of the emergency [LOCATION] in the interactions we undertake with people experiencing homelessness on the streets of our neighborhoods."
10_04_2017,homelessness,"So we're leveraging services by housing people, creating new opportunity for others to access those emergency services. What we know is that over [ORGANIZATION] of joint [STREET] outreach, being out on the [STREET], creating relationship with the folks that are struggling to survive, these people that we see on the streets of our city desperately are looking for the tools needed to end their homelessness. We see the extension of the declaration providing three areas that can enhance those tools that we've already built upon."
10_04_2017,affordable housing,"Let's go ahead and also read [ORGANIZATION], please. [ORGANIZATION], extend sunset of mandatory relocation assistance for involuntary displacements of tenants under affordable housing preservation and [ORGANIZATION] renter protections. So let me just give a brief statement on [ORGANIZATION]."
10_04_2017,homelessness,"And that [STREET] if people want to testify, they can testify either on the emergency extension or on the reload. Colleagues, recognizing that the cost of involuntary displacement burdens residents, increasing the risk of homelessness and poverty, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] passed a temporary mandatory relocation assistance program. While we've been aggressively advocating in the capital for additional tools like Just Cause Eviction Standard and rent control that could help us address our housing emergency faster, we know there are tools we currently do have that can help us make significant progress."
10_04_2017,housing crisis,"I think we know that we have housing crisis in our hand, and our community, particularly low-income community, community of color, immigrant refugees, are especially impacted. I also emphasize that [ORGANIZATION] must take rental location assistance ordinance permanent now with [ORGANIZATION] review. Why permanent?"
10_04_2017,homelessness; housing insecurity,"And she had a sleeping bag unzipped to cover the dirt floor, and we spent [ORGANIZATION] with her there. And like many people experiencing housing insecurity and homelessness, my mom didn't [STREET] around with a [ORGANIZATION], so she showed us the one box that she kept with her, which is full of pictures of us and letters from us. I know through your courageous leadership that you took in [LOCATION] that you know what I know, which is that everybody struggling to make a home or keep a home, that somebody's somebody."
10_04_2017,homeless,"My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I live six blocks from here, and I represent the next wave of...  5,000 newly homeless people. I live in a subsidized [ORGANIZATION] tax credit Section 42 apartment, and I pay $609 a month rent."
10_04_2017,homeless,"I have a list from [ORGANIZATION], and by my count there are 112 apartment buildings in [ORGANIZATION]. And if each one of those has...  40 units. I got my calculator out and that could be 5,000 new Homeless people like me who did nothing wrong."
10_04_2017,homeless,"My daughter has a number of medical challenges as well as my oldest grandson. We have nowhere to turn for money to relocate, yet we cannot afford these unfair [ORGANIZATION] increases, and we certainly do not want to be homeless. I can't imagine carting my family around all over."
10_04_2017,homelessness,"I'm PERSON0. I work in housing and homelessness in [ORGANIZATION] and also in [PERSON] with [PERSON]. But I was here in [ORGANIZATION] to testify about how no-cause evictions were harming my neighborhood, but I'm here [LOCATION] to tell you how they're harming me."
10_04_2017,homelessness,"This has been a huge hit for my family. Without the connections that I have made in my community, I would not have housing right now. Because I do work in housing and homelessness, and the irony is not lost on me that I cannot afford housing otherwise without the connections I've made in my community."
10_04_2017,homelessness,"So I'll be speaking from my personal experience of that area. So the face of homelessness, what I see there, it's a woman with a black eye and a bloody nose. And I will be drawn to out in front of my house, and there's a woman that has the courage to leave her abusive partner, and she's sitting on the neighbor's hillside, and he's threatening to dump her cart with all her belongings in it."
10_04_2017,homelessness,"And that's the face of homelessness I want you to remember, because we need to solve these things. We need to create stability, and I've heard that word mentioned, and you're right on point with that, and I appreciate that. We need to understand that, to a large degree, homelessness and heroin go hand in hand, and we need to seriously address that."
10_04_2017,affordable housing,"And thank you very much, Mr. [PERSON]. That affordable housing bond, the best thing that ever happened to this city. Thank you for your time."
10_04_2017,housing crisis,And [ORGANIZATION] has indicated to [ORGANIZATION] that it does not want to proceed with a relo policy until [PERSON] has made theirs permanent. [PERSON]'s housing crisis doesn't end at our borders. $500 rent increases and no-cause evictions are becoming epidemic in GPE2.
10_04_2017,affordable housing,"Revenues from a vacancy tax would allow city to spend money needed to preserve existing affordable housing and take housing stock out of the dog-eat-dog private market and [STREET] it into community-based ownership, which would lead to a permanent affordability. Until a vacancy tax becomes a reality, and I believe it is not far off, there is something simple and moral [ORGANIZATION] can do to help thousands of tenants citywide right now. You can make the relocation ordinance permanent and make sure it applies to all landlords, not just the large ones."
10_04_2017,homelessness,"A 10% rent increase is unjust, period. And so is a 9.9 or 9.8 rent increase, period. The family thrown into homelessness does not suffer more or less based on whether or not the landlord owns one or many units."
10_04_2017,housing crisis,"Peripherally, we have family members who are undergoing the stress of the housing crisis. We don't have corporate fortunes to buffer us. I've spoken to a lot of landlords who make the same argument."
10_04_2017,houseless,"I am the chairperson of [ORGANIZATION], and I also work with other organizations like ORG1, ORG2, [PERSON], and [LOCATION]. I am here to speak about the state of emergency and ask for it to be extended for [ORGANIZATION]. I  I work with hundreds of houseless people [LOCATION]."
10_04_2017,affordable housing,"I want us to also make sure that we have no demolition of safe, affordable housing. We need to have sustainable housing stock and not replace with these trashy, big monstrosities that have mold and wood rot, but that instead maintain a percentage of units for the percentages of people at the rates of their income. So if we have...  50% of the people living in the area having no more than $700 a month from SSI, then there should be 50% of the units that are built should be for no more than $250 a month rent."
10_04_2017,housing crisis,"Members of the [ORGANIZATION], while some say only rent control can effectively remedy [ORGANIZATION]'s ongoing housing crisis, in the absence of such control, [ORGANIZATION]'s tenant relocation assistant provisions are the only effective alternative for [ORGANIZATION]. I can speak with some authority on the effectiveness of these provisions. With relocation assistance looming for the [ORGANIZATION] back in [LOCATION], DATE2 I and my fellow [ORGANIZATION]-to-[ORGANIZATION] tenancies in our garden complex received a letter that I've provided copies to your office.  from our recently anointed property management company."
10_04_2017,affordable housing,"The [ORGANIZATION] community in general will benefit greatly over the long term from stable housing for its tenant-focused neighborhoods. With stable, affordable housing, tenant families can spend less time desperately worrying about housing costs, finances, and having to move, and more time planning how to get into a higher-paying career and otherwise enhancing the community. The most effective tool available now to eventually achieve this is to make the tenant relocation assistance provisions permanent, mild though they be."
10_04_2017,homelessness,"While tenant relocation assistance will not permanently ensconce tenants in neighborhoods, it does ensure that if the time comes when a property owner decides to convert his property to a higher-yielding use, the effective tenants will have a better shot at avoiding homelessness. Thank you for your time. Thank you."
10_04_2017,affordable housing,"I hope at some point we don't have to extend the housing state of emergency. I hope we have laws and rules in [STREET] that protect people, and we have figured out a [STREET] to significantly boost the production of affordable housing. But for now, I think this is the right thing to do, and I'm proud to support this extension."
10_04_2017,affordable housing,"I think it has definitely helped, uh,  help pave the [STREET] in terms of eliminating some rules, the dumb rules I guess we call them, that may have stowed in the [STREET] of more shelters being added to our system. And also I think it has all stimulated this whole council as well as the county commission and others to look at ways we can boost production of affordable housing. And those goals remain as important as ever."
10_04_2017,homeless; housing crisis,"First of all, Director [PERSON]'s testimony and that of others has highlighted the continued urgency of this housing crisis. And despite a massive increase in investment in housing and homeless services, despite preserving and providing more housing than ever,  and shelter than ever, our homeless population continues to grow in no small part due to our failure to stem the inflow of cost-burdened and displaced renters into our homeless population. The city is addressing the issue on the supply side."
10_04_2017,housing crisis,"It's important that we continue to understand the devastating nature of our housing crisis and the impacts an unregulated market is having on households in every corner of our city. I remain deeply committed to this issue, and my office staff dedicate much of their time researching and developing policies that will mitigate displacement, making housing more accessible and stable, and increasing our supply of truly affordable units. I'm hopeful about the future of renters here because I'm confident  that although we could not come to an agreement [ORGANIZATION], each of my fellow commissioners understands the nature of this emergency and are also dedicated to helping us solve the problems."
10_04_2017,affordable housing,"I was a landlady for a while while my parents-in-law finished up their service in [ORGANIZATION]. And if they had been only planning to move into our first home for [ORGANIZATION], I would have had to have included the $4,500 in the rent for [LOCATION], and that would have increased the rent by $375 a month. That is definitely not what we are...  intending to do we are intending to provide affordable housing to a lot of people so that's something to consider I am concerned with the number of emails and letters that I've received about people completely leaving the rental business because they feel that we're becoming over regulated"
10_04_2017,affordable housing,"I served on [ORGANIZATION]. And...  There was no discussion at that time about affordable housing. Now it's front and centre, and it's not only front and centre for [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON], it's front and centre for GPE2 and other – GPE3 and other jurisdictions in GPE4, [PERSON] as well as [ORGANIZATION]."
10_04_2017,affordable housing,"So that is progress. Commissioner [PERSON] and I serve as the delegates to [ORGANIZATION], and I'm hoping that they will –  really take up this issue of, oh, by the [STREET], why is [ORGANIZATION] the only [STREET] to have a construction excise tax, thanks to Commissioner [PERSON], which then is used for affordable housing? Why don't the other jurisdictions do that?"
10_04_2017,affordable housing,"And what other kind of revenue are we going to maybe think of that could pay for this affordable housing assistance, which is so desperately needed by people who've been living here for [ORGANIZATION]? PERSON0 I want to thank Commissioner [PERSON] for being the architect of this.  of this important piece of legislation."
10_04_2017,affordable housing,"The proposed changes are consistent with [LOCATION] and the DATE0 Broadway Corridor Framework Plan. This project will bring approximately 700 units of affordable housing, a high-density mix of employment, new city attractions including expansion of the park blocks, and signature connections between [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON], and between the LOC2 blocks and FAC0. Colleagues, any further discussion?  Please call the roll."
10_04_2017,homeless,"So this process actually harms the homeless by getting these derelict vehicles. This ordinance is just one tool to prevent the most derelict of RVs from being occupied to begin with and being parked in the right-of-[STREET], creating hazardous conditions. And that's the end of my presentation."
10_04_2017,homeless,"Could we create a similar environment for people that are otherwise homeless? Sure. And just to add a little bit to it, and it's a fabulous idea that I think should be explored,  But [ORGANIZATION] tried much the same thing, and what they found is these [LOCATION] parks didn't become transitional."
10_04_2017,homeless,"so I know one of the gentlemen who's his  He lived in a boat and he lived in a trailer and they've both exploded because they're in such poor repair. So when we talk about the community caretaking piece, we're talking about the entire community. It's not pitting neighbors against homeless people."
10_04_2017,homeless,We do currently find places for them if they are capable of going to a location. So [ORGANIZATION] has paid for application fees. We've located families in these.
10_04_2017,homeless,"It puts them in a bad position. It puts the officers in a bad position, and we've got to put a stop to it from that piece. That's pretty much, I just want to make sure that Mr. [PERSON] knows that we are working and discussing with [ORGANIZATION] about a more efficient [STREET] of dealing with these."
10_04_2017,homeless,"Okay. I mean, that is...  a little bit comforting because that would be one derelict [LOCATION] for every 65 [ORGANIZATION] residents if we did have 10,000. And it makes me very concerned that our homeless count might be grossly off."
10_04_2017,homeless,"PERSON0? So this is a great policy. And as with everything we're doing regarding homeless populations in our community, it is a thoughtful balance."
09_21_2016,homelessness,"Yeah, I think we've all seen some examples lately of really how it does make a difference. I mean, the things that people have been doing about hunger and homelessness in [ORGANIZATION] are really making a difference and are really much needed. Yeah."
09_21_2016,homeless,"Even congregation is a natural right, as finding safety in numbers for a [TIME]'s rest, gaining access to shared resources, developing a sense of confidence and trust, and yes, even access to mates are all found via the formation of groups. DATE0 evolving through group selectivity left us predisposed to form groups for good reason, right?  with us because without any of the aforementioned things we literally would not be here [PERSON] I can't think of a better definition of a need than that if one is not free to use the two hands given them to harvest resources and land given all of us to congregate and make for themselves then yes homeless are entitled to more than being treated like prisoners and missions on that note consider why you pay rent  To me, it means [ORGANIZATION] access, autonomy, and individual accountability."
09_21_2016,affordable housing,"However, I still believe FAC0 should go through, even if [ORGANIZATION] fails to deliver on his half of the deal financially. I'm just saying dispose of the mission side, keep the affordable housing side, charge rent for a bed, and make money off of the problem. and then we'd still come out better off than relying on programs like tpi where we construct a seven-story building just to give 130 people a [ORGANIZATION]'s worth of free rent few of which even make any good use of it as a side note commissioner PERSON1 uh the public right away underneath FAC1 is being leased to [ORGANIZATION]"
09_21_2016,homeless,"PERSON0 i'd question the legality of blocking off a public right away with the use of yellow caution tape people are going to be under that bridge because it's overhead protection from the rain  but we can have them out of the [STREET], or we can have them intruding on a [PERSON] stop causing safety hazards and obstructing the use of a public sidewalk. Mayor [PERSON], bike police are treating homeless people differently than middle class. Laying in a [INSTITUTION] during broad daylight is not a crime, and micromanaging homeless people in this fashion is discrimination."
09_21_2016,affordable housing,"That is our number one concern here. Now again, on these issues as far as I'd like to see money going into an affordable housing fund,  out of some of these proceeds. And again, I do like the fact that some of these owners are initiating sales."
09_21_2016,housing crisis,"So this focused effort is really starting to solve an egregious and unacceptable problem in a city that has a housing crisis. And I, again, want to thank the staff that's working on it. This will come back for a second reading [ORGANIZATION]."
09_21_2016,homeless,"As a more concrete example of something that's coming up, [ORGANIZATION] is actually planning on sending not one but three staff members, staff from the city of [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], up to [PERSON] to learn more about [PERSON]'s data-driven procurement policies and how they have improved homeless services in that realm. So that's just one example of how the partnership will help us apply cutting-edge administrative practices and ensure that these benefits lift the entire community. Thank you."
09_21_2016,homeless; homelessness,"I  Thank you, sir. Because of homeless, growing homelessness, and the increasing cold weather, [ORGANIZATION] has been envisioned a comprehensive solution. But in the interim, you have a warehouse which will serve as a very effective temporary shelter as you plan long-range, a comprehensive retreat  a treatment service to end the revolving door mentality, the revolving door mindset that many seem to be trapped hopelessly in."
09_21_2016,affordable housing,"I remember the things that were really hard. And just as an example, when I had the honor of being the housing commissioner, we were charged with building an affordable housing development in [ORGANIZATION]. And then Director [PERSON] was charged with putting the project together"
12_16_2015,homelessness,"Well, of course, not simple in politics, but then again, pretty straightforward solution and pretty doable, okay? Update on homelessness. Okay, [ORGANIZATION] said in a [ORGANIZATION] litigation that they entered that if your shelters are full, it's cruel and unusual punishment to give people citations for camping."
12_16_2015,homeless; homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION] reaffirmed that. The city of [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], passed an ordinance allowing camping on public lands, on park lands. [PERSON] declared that homeless have a right on public land."
12_16_2015,homeless,"And you do these sweeps, stealing people's property with no authority of law. Another point, I put in a few things in there. There are 10,000 homeless in [ORGANIZATION]."
12_16_2015,homeless,So let's throw this idea away that [ORGANIZATION]'s a mecca for the homeless and people come here. That's pretty humorous. And the solution is before you.
12_16_2015,homelessness,"Got to be in different areas of the community. Let the communities pick where they go. Okay, because this homelessness is in every community, and I understand communities don't like it."
12_16_2015,homeless,"I'm very privileged to be here, and I'm terribly sorry I was [TIME] for communications. It's taken me a lot longer to get anywhere in the city the further I move out, and so  When I first met you all, of course, I came here as a newly homeless person [ORGANIZATION]. And the news now is simply that I'm still trying to function within the subsidized housing market and dealing with apparently a condom minium association that I didn't know about."
12_16_2015,homelessness,"As soon as the landlords found out about the emergency of planning for homelessness, that there would be a [ORGANIZATION] requirement for a 5% increase. No one's getting a 5% increase on their rents. They're getting huge, unbelievable increases."
12_16_2015,affordable housing,"hi okay [ORGANIZATION] direct the city budget office to create an ongoing general fund transfer to [ORGANIZATION] starting [ORGANIZATION]. Thank you, Mayor. I don't have to tell any of you up here that one of our most vexing and urgent problems in the city is not having enough affordable housing."
12_16_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"By our own estimates, we lack 24,000 units of affordable housing to meet the needs of our current residents in our city. We are working on many tracks to tackle this affordable housing crisis. We are accelerating our commitments to new affordable housing developments through our largest ever funding release."
12_16_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"we are revamping our bonus program to prioritize affordable housing development we have taken the first steps to institute the development impact fee for affordable housing and we continue to advocate aggressively for new tools like inclusionary housing [ORGANIZATION] we are poised to take the first step to providing the first ongoing source of funds for our housing investment fund through the dedication of our short-term rental revenues there is no one silver bullet to our housing crisis  no one legislative tool or revenue source to solve our affordable housing crisis we need a myriad of tools and sources of funds [ORGANIZATION] we add one important piece to the tapestry of resources we require so i'd like to now turn it over to my two co-sponsors mayor [PERSON] and commissioner [PERSON] before we bring up the panel thank you i'll just add this these thoughts to that good introduction  This is an extraordinary situation, and it requires extraordinary means. And one of the reasons why I supported this change is that, although in general I don't like dedicating general fund revenues, this situation that we're facing in housing is so significant, and it's going to last a while, that it requires that we use different means."
12_16_2015,housing crisis,"You made it very clear early in your tenure as Commissioner in Charge of [ORGANIZATION] that you wanted to build up a housing investment fund  so that it could become another important tool in our kit to give us flexibility in addressing this housing crisis. In my view, there's a clear nexus between the legalization of short-term rentals, which has taken thousands of units off the market, disproportionately impacting low-income renters, Therefore, I think once that nexus was established, it is entirely appropriate for us to take the revenue from short-term rentals and to put them into a fund which effectively mitigates the negative consequences of short-term rentals."
12_16_2015,affordable housing,"And this is something that we've been working on for [ORGANIZATION], since I started [LOCATION]. First, I'd like to recognize [ORGANIZATION] is an important building block in our kit of tools to provide affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]. The reason it's important, even though it's small, is that the money can be used anywhere in [ORGANIZATION], whereas most of our revenue is dedicated to specific urban renewal areas."
12_16_2015,affordable housing,"It's important also that you know that [ORGANIZATION] currently receives dedicated loan income from our portfolio of affordable housing units. These are performing loans, some 13,600 units financed by the ORG1 citywide. We get about $600,000 a year in revenue."
12_16_2015,homeless,"And I must say that as the council has indicated their interest in helping to resolve the homeless problem, some of that money can be used for operating because it's general fund revenue. This housing investment dollars can only be used for capital. So this might be used in construction."
12_16_2015,affordable housing,"I'm the director of [ORGANIZATION], which represents about 115 organizations in the region dedicated to this very issue, the need for ongoing  ongoing dedicated funding to build back our affordable housing infrastructure. Many of the comments I prepared for you [ORGANIZATION] have already been said, so I'll try to be brief and just add some additional comments. We've studied at length what other cities across [ORGANIZATION] are doing to address the need for local and dedicated revenue."
12_16_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"So there are many different kinds of tools we can look to, but what all these cities agree is that it's necessary in order to combat the housing crisis across the country with these local dedicated fund sources. Okay.  because we're here in this housing crisis due to [ORGANIZATION] of divestment in affordable housing infrastructure, and we need to commit to building back this lost housing inventory. And as many people say, we can't just build our [STREET] out of that."
12_16_2015,affordable housing,"We know it's going to take a lot and probably more than we have to build 24,000 homes  But by increasing minimum wages, we can lift families out of poverty. And the need for affordable housing with inclusionary zoning, we can have our developer and community contribute to this solution. But bottom line, for the families living with fixed incomes, for grandparents on [ORGANIZATION], for veterans with disability pensions, there's no market opportunity."
12_16_2015,affordable housing,"I think this is a historic moment, understanding that we're putting the first time in –  people have fought for [ORGANIZATION] to have a dedicated stream of revenue for affordable housing. And this is a historic moment, even though it's not up to scale that it needs to be. And I just want to say thank you for everyone for taking the time to do the work and look at this very complex issue."
12_16_2015,affordable housing,"But I actually sat on the committee that sort of devised some of the [ORGANIZATION] and short-term rental rules [ORGANIZATION]. And also [LOCATION], I was here testifying that those funds should be dedicated to affordable housing. And it's great to be back [PERSON] and to see that we've come to that conclusion [PERSON]."
12_16_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"but it's a small piece. And we know the elephant in the room is the affordable housing crisis that we're all trying to solve. And they always say, how do you eat an elephant?"
12_16_2015,affordable housing,"And I guess I would add that, sort of echoing [ORGANIZATION]' comments, we don't know actually what the impact is. There would be different ways to mitigate it. Do we just outlaw short-term rentals, or do we ask the beneficiaries, the companies that run these, to actually give much more significant money to fund additional affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]?"
12_16_2015,homeless; affordable housing,"Again, Commissioner [PERSON], I think you're making some real good moves here pertaining to the homeless, providing more affordable housing, and again, also to the Mayor on declaring a state of emergency on housing. Now, again, I think [PERSON] is absolutely an advantage to this city. We're forgetting to calculate that they also go out there and obtain more units that aren't currently on the market."
12_16_2015,affordable housing,They do that through aggressive marketing. And also what we're missing with [ORGANIZATION] is that their system is bringing in tourists from around the world that spend a tremendous amount of money through this local economy –  that will far weigh out any losses that you can calculate pertaining to affordable housing. And you must keep that in mind and also always keep in mind [PERSON].
12_16_2015,affordable housing,"And I think we need to keep that in consideration. Issue number three is that  On the affordable housing issue, I agree with Mayor [PERSON]'s position on going for more shelters. I think it's a good move at this time until we can implement other things as bonds that we can get the more permanent housing."
12_16_2015,affordable housing,"And that's the most important piece of this puzzle is how we continue to get more resources for the affordable housing, permanent housing, and making sure we have enough shelter space, which Mayor [PERSON] is taking some risks there. He's using eco-diversions.  transportation, shuttle buses, transportation to these shelters. I think it's very innovative, and I think it's going to work."
12_16_2015,housing crisis,"But it is nevertheless a good discipline for us to follow, because if we're going to make choices about prioritizing the housing crisis, we will have to –  we will have to make choices about doing less in other areas, even in a better economy, even with a bigger general fund than we've currently forecast. So there's no question this isn't a free good. But if there was ever a time when this would be less painful, it's when our general fund is growing as it is right now."
12_16_2015,affordable housing,"So we do not have a good budget situation. I think that it is reasonable, given that there apparently is evidence that the short-term rentals are reducing the supply of overall affordable housing, to dedicate some money from short-term rental revenues to housing. However, so I am going to support this, but without making any commitment as to how I'll vote on any other budget issue."
12_16_2015,housing crisis,"I don't remember people raising all these concerns about doing so because as a council, we agreed there was a transportation funding crisis. DATE0, we have said there's a housing crisis, and we're going to focus our attention on meeting the needs of people who are literally dying on our streets. So we make choices."
12_16_2015,housing crisis,"We are using a revenue source to mitigate the negative impact of an activity of which I remain very dubious. Second,  Commissioner [PERSON] has laid out a vision for using a housing investment fund as a flexible tool to address this housing crisis. My political mentor, [PERSON], set up a federal housing trust fund."
12_16_2015,affordable housing,"PERSON0? Well, I appreciate the discussion, and I know this is a vexing decision to make, but I think, as I said in my...  opening remarks when we consider that we have a deficit of 24,000, a lack of 24,000 households or 24,000 residents who lack access to affordable housing, and you add another 10,000 in our comp plan projections. You know, we've got to start somewhere with a steady state stream of revenue that can be used for capital investment in affordable housing."
12_16_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"And that's exactly what this is going for. And with the tantalizing ability to use revenue bonds to turn this $1.2 million into $12 to $30 million dollars,  and is just an opportunity that I think we can't pass up. All of us have said we are in an affordable housing crisis."
12_16_2015,housing crisis,"I had the opportunity to meet with my colleagues [ORGANIZATION] who are mayors of other [ORGANIZATION] cities and had sort of a teasing conversation with Mayor [PERSON] from [ORGANIZATION] that [PERSON]'s trying really hard not to be [ORGANIZATION], and actually [ORGANIZATION] wished it had had the chance to not be [ORGANIZATION] either because the housing crisis there is so much greater than ours. So I think that's a great question. So we really need to act with every tool at our disposal, with some level of risk, and with the credible claim to the people that are up against it in housing that we are doing everything we can with every tool that we have."
12_16_2015,housing crisis,"And I think this is consistent with that. We will spend less on shelters someday if we spend more on housing now. We need to spend more on shelters at the moment, and that's a cost of doing business in this housing crisis."
12_16_2015,affordable housing,"My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I work for a nonprofit called [ORGANIZATION]. And so we provide services and work alongside residents living in affordable housing. So we're there to build community amongst those residents and enhance individual quality of life opportunities."
12_16_2015,affordable housing,"They started visiting us on site and teaching us. like map reading skills and doing activities to talk about walking and moving around the city in a less utilitarian [STREET], because that's a lot of folks in affordable housing are using it, and in a more engaging sort of community-building [STREET]. So this led to group walking tours, and the highlight of that was really the resident participants getting to share stories about  about [ORGANIZATION], getting to share their stories."
12_16_2015,affordable housing,"Now, what I'd like to know on this is that  when we're looking at the extraction industries and putting them on this list, is that with the money that we actually divest, where are we going to put that money? And that's my main focus right now is that can we – is there any possibility to look at being able to somehow use some of that money toward affordable housing? And why I ask that is that we're taking a tremendous amount of money from these companies –  And where are we going to put it?"
12_16_2015,affordable housing,"So I like the extraction industries removing that money, but can we put it towards some type of affordable housing type situation? And that's my question. Mr. [PERSON], it's not that we're taking money out of these companies."
12_16_2015,affordable housing,"And my point to you is that,  Is there a [STREET] to divest out of the fossil fuel industry and invest in affordable housing industry? Is there a [STREET] to do that? And we are investing money into these companies."
12_16_2015,affordable housing,"So putting the money into affordable housing would be a big departure from our current financial policies where we maintain a certain pool of investments based on certain criteria that are applied to the companies. Even if you could reach that same return, and that would be backed by certain investors to make sure you have that guaranteed return. PERSON0, this is really probably not the right [STREET] to have this discussion right now."
12_16_2015,affordable housing,"I completely applaud your idea of using the funds  [ORGANIZATION] funds have a little more flexibility to do that, depending on the law. These are heavily circumscribed, and we can't put it into affordable housing. That's the short answer."
12_16_2015,affordable housing,"Why I brought this up during my communication is that I wanted it to possibly be looked at  from various individuals to see if there can't be some changes or some directions made toward affordable housing with some of these funds. And that's all I've asked at this time. And then they can counter back and tell me why it can't be done, and then we can look at possible ways of understanding that maybe we can go in a certain direction to do it."
10_22_2015,affordable housing,"This is for $968,000, which is [ORGANIZATION]'s portion of the home funding, which is a federal funding formula for housing assistance.  determined by population and other criteria the city of [ORGANIZATION] intends to use this to fund tenant-based rental assistance development of affordable housing and down payment assistance to low-income home buyers so just in case anyone's wondering if this is not us spending portland general fund on [ORGANIZATION] it's us being a conduit for federal funds to [ORGANIZATION] yeah"
10_22_2015,homeless,"Okay. Now we have one more item left over from [ORGANIZATION]'s calendar, and that's [DATE]. Okay.  amend contract with [ORGANIZATION] to add $50,000 to house chronically homeless women for a total not to exceed $160,000."
10_22_2015,homelessness,"Commissioner [PERSON] again. Thank you, Mayor. From our [ORGANIZATION] point in time homelessness count, we know that on any given night more than 1,000 women experience homelessness in [ORGANIZATION], including more than 560 without basic emergency shelter or transitional housing."
10_22_2015,homelessness,"Without going into too much detail, this funding within this amendment will allow Catholic charities to help 10 additional households headed by women to move from homelessness into housing. And this doesn't represent an increase in funds. It's really a reprogramming of funds from joined to Catholic charities serving the same population."
10_22_2015,affordable housing,"It's access to housing for people who are here for [ORGANIZATION] at a time, and many of our outpatient transplant patients are. If they can't get affordable housing, they can't get care. And so that guest house, if you will, with 76 units of housing, much of it free for those people who stay there is to meet that need."
05_04_2017,affordable housing,"So I'll follow up with you on that. Thank you. And the other thing to the point of the conversation you just had with my colleague, I just want to acknowledge that there is some conversation that's percolating about how to bring down the cost of affordable housing."
05_04_2017,affordable housing,"But number three, and the one where you potentially have the greatest savings at the greatest cost, is backing off family waste jobs. So if we seek to build affordable housing for low-income families but we don't pay the workers a living wage, that's a problem. So keep your eye on that because those are three ideas that when you hear about bringing down the cost of affordable housing, here's a little secret."
05_04_2017,affordable housing,"It must all happen. You have to provide wages for people to sustain living and support their families, and then to move into other housing and make that affordable housing affordable for the next family. So we're in agreement."
05_04_2017,affordable housing,"No.  That role? Anyway, if that's the case, then I'd like you to put your heads together and do that. So we ask that the city take a convening role in building the partnerships that will establish this much-needed integration of  a first floor multicultural entrepreneurial incubator opportunity, 9 through 12 public education training in the health industry, manufacturing, and possibly construction, [TIME] adult workforce training, affordable housing, and [ORGANIZATION] relocation or office space to help fund the whole thing."
05_04_2017,homelessness; affordable housing,"First, I would like to thank you for your focus on affordable housing and homelessness issues and your advocacy at the state level. in the support of affordable housing and the tools for anti-displacement and tenant rights. [ORGANIZATION] has been very busy over [ORGANIZATION]."
05_04_2017,affordable housing,"We have met with city, county, metro, and state elected officials to advocate for adequate affordable housing and for anti-displacement tools such as lifting the ban on rent control,  and the elimination of no-cause evictions, which will help stabilize the housing for [ORGANIZATION] residents and also balance the affordable and accessible housing supply throughout [ORGANIZATION]. We also have joined with the partners of [ORGANIZATION] to advocate for funding for expanding home ownership for moderate and low-income and people of color. When it comes to anti-displacement tools, we did advocate and support the inclusionary zoning program here at the city."
05_04_2017,housing crisis; affordable housing,"The committee's advocacy for this program was because we were seeing the housing crisis impacting [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] has a significant amount of privately owned affordable housing, or should I say we did have a significant amount. Rents are constantly going up."
05_04_2017,affordable housing,"We felt that in the short term with this program, we could increase the amount of regulated affordable housing for [ORGANIZATION] while efforts were made to construct additional affordable multi-family units. Unfortunately, in [LOCATION], Mayor's budget, it was reduced to less than $500,000. The slow implementation of this program has been part of the issue."
05_04_2017,affordable housing,It will be less costly to be proactive in providing long-term affordable housing now than to try to buy back as what is being done in [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]east [ORGANIZATION]. I would be negligent as a school board member. if I didn't mention one of the most important factors of stabilizing housing.
05_04_2017,housing crisis; affordable housing,"As a housing committee, we will continue to advocate for equitable funding for additional affordable housing with a focus on ongoing funds, one-time funds, and we will be asking for 26% of the housing bond funds to be spent in [ORGANIZATION], equal to what the population percentage is. As a committee, we will also continue to work with the city and other local jurisdictions to advocate for legislative changes to make it possible for our local entities to have the anti-displacement tools they need to handle this housing crisis. Again, thank you for your time and your support on these important housing issues."
05_04_2017,affordable housing,"And there were some things in the report that, frankly, troubled me greatly. And the trend line on affordable housing investments in [ORGANIZATION], I'd like to go back and look at those numbers. That concerns me."
04_26_2017,houseless,"I think that you guys spend money [ORGANIZATION] and it really has nothing to do with the citizens of [ORGANIZATION] and their well-being But it has everything to do with making your perfect little town even wider and even prettier for white people and it's shameful and  It's shameful that I have to go to the county to get help with the houseless issue because you guys, I can't keep you awake there. I'm sorry, is this germane to the contract?"
04_26_2017,homelessness,And we had to do an awful lot of that work on the fly. The good news is I think we learned a lesson or two from that experience in terms of preparation and collaboration. And [ORGANIZATION] has really stepped up in a big [STREET].
04_26_2017,affordable housing,"Every time we hear conversations about affordable housing, there's a huge segment of the population that doesn't get addressed, and that is people like myself who are over [ORGANIZATION]. people like myself who are can be deemed disabled who are living in this type of housing just to give some clarification 60% of [ORGANIZATION] the building that I live in a single person  cannot make more than 50% or 60% of the [ORGANIZATION], which means for a person like myself, the maximum amount of money that I can make in order to continue to live in the housing that I live in is about $24,000. My [ORGANIZATION] is about $19,000."
04_26_2017,affordable housing,"And thank you for clarifying, because there's a lot of confusion. Unfortunately, I've come to find out that affordable housing has its own language, and it is not helpful. So these  it depends how many people in your household, and it's a threshold income."
04_26_2017,homeless,"And so, and I'll just put that in context. An independent study was released recently saying we're short just under 2,[ADDRESS], who's been chronically homeless, and give them a fighting chance of being a successful tenant."
04_26_2017,homeless,"And the best example of where we've had success, and I think Commissioner [PERSON] deserves a bow on this, is when we made a commitment as a city and a county to greatly reduce the amount of veterans who are homeless. And we had a very friendly tool then. We had something called a VASH voucher, and that was a federal voucher that provided a subsidy for the home and services."
04_26_2017,housing crisis,"And so that's why I believe we should be spending more of our money with the county addressing people who are in poverty areas.  because it's going to cost us a lot more if we don't, and I think it's morally the right thing to do. The reason I will support the applications before us [ORGANIZATION] is that it turns out this housing crisis is impacting people across the income ladder. And if we don't have workforce housing or housing for working-class people, then shame on us."
04_26_2017,affordable housing,"Okay. So it shows that affordable housing, you know, we lack 25,000 units of affordable housing, and we need to have all cylinders working. And the multi is an important cylinder."
04_26_2017,affordable housing,"We need direct subsidies. We need the multi-program if we're going to really be serious about meeting our goals of affordable housing for the residents of our city. So this is great, and thank you for the good work."
04_26_2017,affordable housing,"And this really relates to what we just heard, this very successful and increasingly successful program to build affordable housing. And one of the problems is we ran up against the agreed-upon cap between the city and the county and the school district about how much revenue to forego [ORGANIZATION] in this cycle to make these multi-programs work. And what we're seeing now is an increasing number of multi-applications, and it makes sense to move towards a, rather than setting the cap [ORGANIZATION] at $1.5 million, I believe it was set at, of lost revenue, to come up with a rolling average over [LOCATION] not to exceed $15 million."
04_26_2017,homeless,"And I can just think of a million things that [ORGANIZATION] could do with $30,000 besides police overtime and sweeping homeless people. Thank you. Thank you."
04_26_2017,affordable housing,"There are two technical additions in this supplemental budget. The authorization of the housing capital fund is being undertaken by [ORGANIZATION]. That fund will be used to budget affordable housing capital project spending, largely related to the recently passed general obligation bond."
04_26_2017,homeless,"It sounds like the only thing holding us up is a question that Commissioner [PERSON] has. And it's actually to address a concern that Commissioner [PERSON] raised during [ORGANIZATION] budget process, where we had a very narrow three to two vote that Commissioner [PERSON] and Mayor PERSON3 joined me in to allocate $350,000 to a project that had come out of [ORGANIZATION] to  do outreach on housing and homeless services. And Commissioner [PERSON] voted against it, saying that he was not confident that the money would go out to the community."
04_26_2017,homeless,"And so since the request is now changed into two internal positions,  some of which seems primarily related to the work of [ORGANIZATION]. I'm wondering what council, and as I say, I would have hoped that Commissioner [PERSON] would have been part of this,  What council is thinking on that? Particularly, Mayor, you're looking at the office, creating an office of landlord and tenant services, and also you obviously are representative to the joint office."
04_26_2017,homelessness,"We are turning $120,000 back to the general fund. We are trying to use these dollars to their absolute  best potential. And I'm not convinced that doling out grants to a variety of community groups to engage members in discussion about our homelessness issues is going to be effective or move not just the conversation forward but actual progress on the issue."
04_26_2017,homelessness,"appropriate role of the joint office vis-a-vis the interests of the city of [ORGANIZATION]. We have lots and lots of interactions with neighborhood associations, with community organizations, with people in the community around not only solutions to homelessness, but also some of the manifestations of homelessness. Okay.  working with us to address abandoned campsites, working with us to address some of the issues around public health, public safety, environmental issues."
04_26_2017,affordable housing,"We urge the city to support the recommendation to clarify the scope of design review doesn't include changes to base entitlements given by long-range planning and zoning, potentially reducing the number of homes in designated high-capacity areas. Thank you.  to better align development and design review process to lessen delays and costs, which can impact both availability and affordability.  to allow the type of review to be appropriate for the size of the project with clear and objective standards, to consider where outside the central city the D overlay may not be appropriate, and weigh its application carefully with potential impact on affordability where that is an issue. In particular, consider allowing non-profit developers and or affordable housing projects to meet a different set of clearly defined standards."
04_26_2017,affordable housing,"We also encourage the City to consider that any limitations on entitlements and therefore new housing will, by virtue of the recently adopted [ORGANIZATION], also result in potential loss of permanently affordable housing in our most well-connected, amenity-rich areas. There are two recommendations by [ORGANIZATION] we also wanted to highlight, which is the great improvements to public process to increase inclusivity and our commitment to equity in the city, and differentiating between more intense central city and sub-districts and those less intense sub-districts to reflect the unique character of those neighborhoods. Lastly, we encourage the city to always consider the de-overlay criteria  any project really, in light of its long, of its stated long-range planning goals, namely the Climate Action Plan and the Comprehensive Plan's equity and anti-displacement goals."
04_26_2017,affordable housing,"Okay. And then I'm rather struck when the consultant said that affordable housing was really tangential to this whole effort. Again, from my perspective, affordable housing was really the genesis of this whole effort."
04_26_2017,affordable housing,"So what am I missing here? So we did have a sub-consultant working on the affordable housing aspect piece of it. And really, we were trying to set the framework for all of design review."
04_26_2017,affordable housing,"And as we've discussed, design review is a subset of  of development review in total. Unfortunately, we didn't delve as deep into affordable housing as we would have liked to. We certainly have in the [ORGANIZATION] process that Mayor [PERSON] and Commissioner [PERSON] have been discussing, and we've been delving deep into it in that respect."
04_26_2017,affordable housing,"And like [ORGANIZATION] mentioned, [ORGANIZATION] has looked at the recommendations to see what the effect would be on affordable housing and has some findings in there. That wasn't the genesis of the project though, was it? The charge to the consultant was not see how does our review affect affordable housing."
04_26_2017,affordable housing,"Right. So the – I guess, you know, it's probably not in your contract, but I think the genesis for these discussions we've been having over [ORGANIZATION] have been related in part to affordable housing projects objecting, and maybe objecting is too strong a word, but having strong concerns about the time –  and expense of design review, the expense added to projects by design review. So I think, you know, if memory serves me correctly, and I'm not always the best on timelines, but there was certainly an axis of connection there."
04_26_2017,affordable housing,"So we needed to settle that issue. That was one of the motivations for it. And then since then also, we've gone through the [ORGANIZATION] process and this whole idea of the cost that actually –  Early on, you had hearings of this with ORG1 here of what kind of role that permit processes play in the cost of affordable housing."
04_26_2017,affordable housing,"And I appreciated comments from a whole range of folks, even when there was tension or disagreement. I think these are really fascinating and vital issues that are coming up. And, of course, unsurprisingly, I'm also very concerned with how  we are impacting development, specifically development of affordable housing."
04_26_2017,affordable housing,"And I meant no disrespect for any of the commissions that are present [ORGANIZATION]. My example about concerns over design commission and affordable housing projects are as related to me as my term as housing commissioner. I'm not casting judgment one [STREET] or the other whether those concerns are legitimate or not, but nevertheless, those are concerns that I've heard and have talked with [ORGANIZATION] about and numerous other people as well."
04_26_2017,affordable housing,I think that's one of the reasons that people come to [ORGANIZATION] is that we're not just saying slop anything up wherever you want to because we need more housing we're saying you can do both and that's as again what I've said [ORGANIZATION] throughout the process we were saying yes you may be taking more density and we're going to make sure that it fits in the context of the neighbourhood and that it's got  appropriate design and affordable housing does not have to be ugly housing.
03_04_2015,homeless,"Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel regarding human trafficking. She called and is not able to make it. 232, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel regarding homeless issues."
03_04_2015,homeless,"No.  Asleep, store your belongings, or stand still. For homeless people across [ORGANIZATION], these circumstances are an ordinary part of [DATE] life. In [ORGANIZATION], people are criminalized on a [DATE] basis for just trying to survive."
03_04_2015,homeless; homelessness; affordable housing,"Sitting, standing, sleeping, and eating in public in many cities in the [ORGANIZATION] are illegal. According to [ORGANIZATION], homeless people are criminalized, let's see,  punished or being in public, even when they have no alternatives. [PERSON] is caused by a severe shortage of affordable housing and fewer emergency shelter beds than homeless people."
03_04_2015,affordable housing,"Despite a lack of affordable housing and shelter space, many cities have chosen to criminally punish people living on the [STREET] for doing what any human being must do to survive. In [ORGANIZATION], for example, there used to be a sit-lie ordinance that made it illegal for people to sit or lie on a sidewalk. There is still a law that makes it illegal to cover yourself if you're lying in a park or public space."
03_04_2015,homelessness,"Other laws affecting homelessness include camping in public, sleeping in public, laws against panhandling, sleeping in a vehicle, and food sharing. These laws are against the very Constitution.  that everyone has against people's basic human rights as afforded by [ORGANIZATION]. I would like to read from the Declaration of Human Rights put out by [PERSON] at ORG2."
03_04_2015,homeless,"old age, and the lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control. In three states, homeless bill of rights have been passed. These states are [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], and GPE2."
03_04_2015,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] was the first state in the nation to pass a homeless bill of rights ensuring that no one is discriminated against based on their housing status. For the first time, basic rights such as the right to vote,  to access to gainful employment or gain housing can't be denied because someone lists a shelter or a [STREET] corner as their address. [PERSON] is trying to pass a very similar law that will allow people to shelter themselves, cover themselves, and sleep in a vehicle that is legally parked."
03_04_2015,homeless; affordable housing,"I do believe it does need to happen because I think our stock of affordable housing, and I do mean truly affordable housing, is growing. you you we don't have enough housing to put every homeless person in a in an apartment or a house so that is one of the the main solutions I can come up with I know it's a temporary thing and the other the other thing is is"
03_04_2015,affordable housing,"Throughout the process of tackling displacement and gentrification in north and northeast [ORGANIZATION],  we have heard time and again from the community about the need to support the elderly to help them age in [STREET] with dignity and safety. While this council item that we are considering [ORGANIZATION] predates the [ORGANIZATION] initiative, it nonetheless captures the spirit of that work. Since DATE1, FAC0 has provided affordable housing to low-income seniors from in and around Northeast [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood."
03_04_2015,affordable housing,"DATE0, when revitalization efforts first started to take shape in inner [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] of the [ORGANIZATION], a consortium of African American Baptist churches, partnered with [ORGANIZATION] to develop land the ORG2 owned for affordable housing. Their goal was to serve older African Americans and other seniors who attended their churches regularly. and who had needed affordable housing to remain in the neighborhood."
03_04_2015,affordable housing,"It was the first project done by an African-American nonprofit sponsor group in [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] approached [ORGANIZATION] to buy the building and preserve the affordable housing for current and future elderly tenants. ORG2, which is the item before us DATE1, is proposing to invest nearly $2 million in  towards the $4.15 million redevelopment and acquisition cost, and in doing so, we'll extend the affordability of senior housing in a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood through DATE2."
03_04_2015,affordable housing,"Very important to have.  affordable housing for seniors in inner northeast [ORGANIZATION] and be able to do that in a 64-unit complex where the majority of people are really their rents are between 30% and 47% of MFI. In this case, what we know is that the lower end is related more to those who have certificates  The general sweet spot is right around 40 percent, meaning that they are able to pay rents somewhere between $450 and $[ADDRESS] that it would maintain as many people as possible."
03_04_2015,affordable housing,"Anticipating that these fees would be exhausted about [ORGANIZATION] and the partnership, the general partners who were there in the beginning would be on their [STREET] because of the expiration of the tax credits, we made a decision as a Board in [LOCATION] that it would be best for us to sell the property because of our own incapacity to do the greater work that we think needs to be done there. But we wanted to make sure to sell it not just to any other high bidder, but really to sell it to another non-profit affordable housing developer whose main focus was to develop and operate quality affordable and rentable housing and would have the financial capacity to continue to operate it the [STREET] we intended from the beginning. We're blessed to have worked with [ORGANIZATION] for DATE2."
03_04_2015,affordable housing,"So why is [ORGANIZATION] taking on this challenge? The simple answer is organizations are most sustainable when they stay focused on what they do best, and preserving affordable housing for the long term is one of the things [ORGANIZATION] tries to do best. It's been part of who we've been since we were founded in [ORGANIZATION]."
03_04_2015,affordable housing,"And as several of you actually know very well because of your past involvement and even involvement on the board, in some cases in [ORGANIZATION] and [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION] preserved hundreds of units of affordable housing in inner southeast [ORGANIZATION], and all that housing remains DATE2 affordable. And so that's vital housing, some of the last affordable housing in inner southeast [ORGANIZATION]. We're now also doing some of that same work in northeast [ORGANIZATION] and have been for [ORGANIZATION]."
03_04_2015,affordable housing,"So that meant we were going to have to be creative on the financing. And you already heard it mentioned, but I really want to call out [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]. They're based here in [ORGANIZATION], and they pool funds from several banks."
03_04_2015,affordable housing,"I know it is a grant, but upon a sale, just a percentage paid back. And, again, to keep these unit prices low, I have no concerns whatsoever, and you're locking in the affordable housing. Again, I do commend all parties involved on that."
03_11_2015,homeless,Police should also walk around schools. Homeless people are just sitting around and looking for cans. Police should be more focused on kids.
03_11_2015,homeless,"212. I mean, that's obscene. And the park rangers obviously do a better job than our [INSTITUTION], where obviously  We're more friendly being advocates for the homeless with the park rangers than we are with the [INSTITUTION]."
03_11_2015,homelessness,"For [ORGANIZATION], what I've been telling people, trying to educate them that homelessness is not a crime,  If you see a crime in presence, call 911. What I've been telling people, another [STREET] to do it is ask the mayor and the police chief to expand [ORGANIZATION] to cover [ORGANIZATION] Park. So it's encouraging to hear Mayor [PERSON] say that they're going in that direction."
03_11_2015,houseless,"And to see how they've interacted with social services, the houseless community, and other vulnerable populations has been truly impressive, and they've carried through on that training. So again, I appreciate your time [TIME] and hearing me provide some support for the park rangers. Thank you."
03_11_2015,affordable housing,"There weren't any services available, and so the rangers went above and beyond and were able to connect with the families of the men and the women who were in the park. There had been some estrangement, and the rangers were able to work with them to get the family to –  come together and the parents of those campers then came to later to thank the rangers for their intervention so that that's one example of a happy ending one of a less happy ending was a camper a mother with a small baby in lens park the rangers tried to connect her with services and were told that the wait for a mother with a baby is [ORGANIZATION] to get into housing and so that in fact [LOCATION], I was in [ORGANIZATION] for a neighborhood association meeting and talking about the challenges of people living in [ORGANIZATION] Park and there's just nowhere for them to go. So I did appreciate the suggestion that there needs to be a multi-bureau look at how do we  help people who have to live outside pending finding more affordable housing."
03_11_2015,homeless,"Item 260. Authorize a grant agreement with [ORGANIZATION] for $15,000 to support one outreach specialist to continue outreach to homeless and runaway youth and ongoing training and coaching of volunteers. Do we have a presentation on this?"
03_11_2015,homeless,"And there is some connection between this and the earlier item where we had the 25-page good report from [ORGANIZATION], the new park security director. We didn't talk about distressed juveniles that are encountered by the rangers, an area that really should get specific attention. And although it's one particular agency, [ORGANIZATION] here, who had a paperwork glitch recently,  I want you to know that all citizens want to see tight cooperation between you and the different semi-private organizations such as [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] that are not just a safety net but a lifeline for homeless children."
03_11_2015,homelessness,"We support and urge you to pass the ordinance that will remove barriers for countless black LBGTQ people, specifically youth and young adults and thousands more throughout the city. As we live in a culture of homophobia, social stigma, anti-gay violence, [PERSON], ignorance and unacceptance, which too often push black and brown, gay and transgendered people into a cycle of homelessness, unemployment and sometimes leads to crimes of survival. In our groundbreaking [ORGANIZATION] report, created in partnership with [ORGANIZATION], it highlights the experiences and disparities impacting black LGBTQ Oregonians."
03_11_2015,homeless,"The report quantifies our concerns and what we have known about our LGBTQ community. We are still highly disproportioned. In [ORGANIZATION], there were a startling rate of 18% unemployment in our community and an estimated 42% of homeless LGBT youth of color."
04_03_2019,homeless,"I  The subject I want to talk about [ORGANIZATION] is not a pretty one. It's about the homeless camping. It's against the law, yet it is still happening throughout the city."
04_03_2019,housing crisis,"Dr. [PERSON]. I mean, I'm particularly interested in that issue. Because while I certainly support and celebrate our tourism industry, my first  concern is how it's impacting our housing crisis and that is specific to short-term rentals."
04_03_2019,houseless,"All right. Thank you mayor Thank you so much excellent report  I want to go back to something Commissioner [PERSON] said, which is how is our rising houseless population impacting tourism? And what's the role of the tourism industry to help us find housing that people can afford to live in?"
04_03_2019,houseless,"I was pleased to see that. There certainly are blips around some of the protests that happened and things like that, but generally we aren't seen as much different than any other city. One of the things that we are doing on a houseless situation, [ORGANIZATION], who's our Vice President of [ORGANIZATION], has convened [ORGANIZATION]."
04_03_2019,houseless,"Okay. However, I think there are [STREET] too many tables trying to address the problem of people being houseless that don't have anybody at the table who's actually experienced houselessness. And so you get better outcomes when you're actually talking to the people on the front line."
04_03_2019,homeless,"[PERSON]. report on recent work from [ORGANIZATION], data loss prevention, restoration projects and green streets, cleanups of homeless camps and the [ORGANIZATION] following of reporting. [PERSON], Welcome."
04_03_2019,homeless,"I'm a performance auditor and I led our [ORGANIZATION] audit of the city's camp cleanup program. [ORGANIZATION] was created in [LOCATION] and it takes complaints about camps, assesses site conditions and removes trash and camps on city property."
04_03_2019,homelessness,"We did find that there were some improvements in communication of folks as well as program data. For people making a report about the camp, they like the ease of reporting a camp, but they did want status updates about what was occurring with their complaint. We were pleased to find that the city was meeting legal requirements for posting notice and we saw firsthand that crews were being respectful with those experiencing homelessness."
04_03_2019,homeless,"These crews are hired through a contract with the city and many of the crew members themselves are formerly homeless individuals. People living in the camps wanted better information on when the cleanups would occur. So rather than a [ORGANIZATION] window, they wanted more information about when exactly they would have to move."
04_03_2019,homeless,"And so this is really a good [STREET] for, at least I'll speak for me personally, to be able to track the work that's being done and to find out if we really are improving our governance in the process. So thank you for that. My last question has to do with the reports around the cleanup of the house, the homeless camps."
04_03_2019,houseless,"So you know what I'm saying? So I'm trying to understand if I'm houseless and my ID is gone, my medicine is gone, if I call and complain, am I going to get help if I go through this process? Commissioner, so they take complaints from anybody."
04_03_2019,homelessness,"It could be somebody who lives in a neighborhood and somebody is, there's a group of folks that are homelessness near the neighborhood, they want that [STREET] cleaned up. It could be somebody who potentially is living in a camp. In many cases when we went out and did field work, the folks who were actually living in the camp helped with the cleanup."
04_03_2019,homeless,"I want to speak specifically to the homeless.  and urban camping impact reduction program. This has obviously had a very rapid evolution just in [ORGANIZATION]. We have an [ORGANIZATION] agreement, a legal agreement, which has been in [STREET] since [LOCATION]."
04_03_2019,homeless,"I also want to acknowledge that the office moved the storage from a [STREET] that was really inconvenient to a [STREET] that is now centrally located and easier for people to gain access to. [ORGANIZATION] started out in [ORGANIZATION] as a one [ORGANIZATION] program in the mayor's office. And it's now grown over [LOCATION] to include [ORGANIZATION], which you mentioned, as well as [ORGANIZATION]."
04_03_2019,homelessness,The goal of this program is not to solve homelessness. There are other programs that are supported and funded by the city to address the issue of homelessness. This program's goal is specifically to reduce the impacts of these camps by managing the waste and keeping the community safe and clean for the benefit of everyone in the community.
04_03_2019,homeless,"You cannot make everybody happy  when you were doing this work and we've already seen something in the dynamic in this chamber [TIME] there are some people who will say we are not doing enough and make no mistake about it this program is not resourced to the scale of the problem in this community on the other hand there are those who say we're doing [STREET] too much  This is characterized as sweeping homeless camps. You're never going to make everybody happy, but the work that you do is important. You get all the complaints."
04_03_2019,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] has worked with [ORGANIZATION] for quite some time on affordable housing issues as well as was on the committee that moved forward the original ballot measure for [ORGANIZATION] itself, [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] is also a public policy advocate for [ORGANIZATION] and we are privileged and honored to have her on our oversight committee. So with that, I would turn it over to [ORGANIZATION]."
04_03_2019,affordable housing,"PERSON0 Just as [STREET] of reminder, [ORGANIZATION] passed a comprehensive inclusionary policy, housing policy in [ORGANIZATION]. Prior to when that policy took effect, 19,000 units of housing were permitted and vested in that program beforehand, meaning they did not have to comply with the requirements to include affordable housing in their developments."
04_03_2019,affordable housing,"Based on the large pipeline that did not supply any affordable housing, the mayor and commissioners asked us to look at creating a program to incent that pipeline to come forward and voluntarily include affordable housing. After working with city council and [ORGANIZATION], a program was approved to provide a limited tax exemption for a period of [ORGANIZATION] in exchange for [ORGANIZATION] of affordability. The development you have before you [PERSON] is the first development to take advantage of that program."
04_03_2019,affordable housing,"It will be providing eight units in their new development for affordable housing. The range of rent savings for tenants who would reside in that building would be from a $479 savings [DATE] to $650 savings [DATE] in the one bedrooms. And with that, I would like to just turn it over to [ORGANIZATION] to add a few comments, and we're here to answer any questions you might have."
04_03_2019,affordable housing,"Good morning, Commissioners, Mayor [PERSON]. I'm [PERSON], Program Manager of [ORGANIZATION]. AND AS [PERSON], THIS PROJECT WILL BRING EIGHT UNITS TO [ORGANIZATION]."
04_03_2019,housing crisis,"Our failure to protect tenants and stabilize rents has contributed to an unprecedented housing crisis, which is now in [ORGANIZATION]. It has changed the face of our city, decimated communities, and impacted the future of tens of thousands of [ORGANIZATION] residents. It's terrible for our economy, our environment, our social and cultural fabric, and our spirit."
04_03_2019,homeless,"Because this data was used, a lot of the data points were used to create the rest of the documents that you'll hear [ORGANIZATION]. Starting with one app, you will...  When we first designed One App, we had the premise that we could create access to housing for everybody if we let everyone know where they qualify to live. Through my own homeless experience, that seemed like what made the most sense."
04_03_2019,homelessness,"That's 10 out of 1,000 units. The amount of money and time it would take for you to find one of those random needle in a haystack properties can be so much and so expensive that it creates homelessness that's unnecessary. People qualify for housing, they just can't navigate the rental market."
04_03_2019,homeless,"That's how it works. There's one thing that I wanted to make sure that...  I helped change and inform the narrative of this conversation going forward because before I, originally when I first spoke with [ORGANIZATION]'s group, I had this impression that was kind of created just universally about what property management companies are. And because I went through my own homeless experience, I kind of had my own idea what they were."
04_03_2019,homeless,"So the only reason I'm bringing this up is because I know that we're going to paint a  First of all, I want to let you know, I actually want, throughout my homeless process, faith is really the only thing that got me through it. And I want those pins on that map to be green for people more than probably anybody else in this room. But at the same time, I mean, it's not a job for me."
04_03_2019,affordable housing,"As you can see, the mission statement says, we wanted to create clear channels to access housing of choice for all renters regardless of background that is consistent, fair and equitable and maintains dignity and humanity for the renter. With our workshops, we met with a large variety of impacted community members, including housing providers to negotiate the details. As you can see, we spent almost 55% of our time in workshop with private market and affordable housing providers, and there were significant improvements to our policy drafts because of it."
04_03_2019,affordable housing,"Our second finding is that there is clear discrimination in affordability. So while property values and home prices are skyrocketing, average wages for people of color are going down. Because all or almost all of the city's neighborhoods are unaffordable to many people of color, we are reinforcing economic segregation through displacement and putting inordinate strain on affordable housing providers and their very limited housing stock."
04_03_2019,homeless; homelessness,"Nationally, black and [ORGANIZATION] individuals comprise an estimated 58% of the [ORGANIZATION] prison population, despite accounting for only 25% of the total [ORGANIZATION] population. These impacts are well documented by [ORGANIZATION] and form the foundation of their guidance around individualized assessments. Additionally, [ORGANIZATION] found that justice-involved individuals are subject to public policies that impede successful reintegration into society, especially housing, leading to higher rates of recidivism and homelessness."
04_03_2019,homelessness,"So in essence, we allow justice-involved individuals to continue to be punished even after they have served their time and posed on them by the justice system. The stigma of past incarceration continues to [STREET] public policies that either exacerbate or quietly allows a lack of access to fundamental resources, like housing, that enable them to contribute positively to society and avoid negative outcomes, like increased recidivism and homelessness. It's a vicious cycle of our own making."
04_03_2019,homelessness,"There is literally no [STREET] for a renter to overcome the stigma of a previous eviction until they are given the opportunity to build a better rental history. It's a [DATE] that leads to homelessness. Instead, only specific patterns of recent behavior can accurately assess risk."
04_03_2019,affordable housing,"This puts tremendous pressure on affordable housing provider resources as well as creates economic segregation that impacts people of color the most. Also, people who have Section 8 vouchers have extreme difficulty finding market rate housing they can afford, and at least 25% are forced to give the voucher back.  and at least half of all voucher holders are seniors and people with disabilities. We are recommending landlords cannot reject applicants who make at least two times the rent or at least two and a half times when three major utility costs are paid directly by the tenant."
04_03_2019,affordable housing,"As you can see, the number of units available to people who make 60% [ORGANIZATION] or less is about half the number of people who need them. Lowering the income ratio allows us to ease some of this mismatch, which based on a previous map clearly demonstrates economic segregation, while also easing some of the resource burden put upon our limited affordable housing units. Okay, so let's talk about screening for barriers."
04_03_2019,affordable housing,"And finally, the best part. I'm so excited to get to this moment. We wrapped up our development of this policy by conducting a beta test with affordable housing providers, market rate providers, legal advocates, and resource advocates."
04_03_2019,affordable housing,"Rental history, again, will be a barrier for a substantial number of people who do not have a reported rental history for whatever reason. So in terms of looking at these outcomes, essentially what I've done is simulate the screening. Giving folks a sort of yes, no, we're an indeterminate across four policies this policy proposal the standard screening provided by a multi-family [ORGANIZATION] provided by another private industry group and one provided by central city concern to represent an affordable housing providers and  So, we looked at all tenants across all four policies and then tried to drill down on some specific groups of persons with issues or backgrounds that were flagged as having particular concern."
04_03_2019,affordable housing,"The fair policy proposal in looking at outcomes looks most like, and in fact very similar to, central city concern as an affordable housing providers policy. So the kinds of practices of those providers would be similar to this policy. Overall, from one-third to one-half of the applicants with data in this data set are newly approved with the [ORGANIZATION] policy as compared to current industry standard operating procedure."
04_03_2019,affordable housing,"similar to the kind of screening that happens with affordable housing providers now. Folks who are of course dedicated to providing access to folks with lower incomes. And this policy would increase the acceptance rate on the criteria of history, rental history barriers for people of color, low-income applicants and those with housing choice vouchers."
04_03_2019,affordable housing,"And this policy is designed to increase housing access to fair housing protected classes that the beta test has demonstrated, time-saving.  that have time and again been proven to have less access to private market housing, for which market rate and affordable housing development will not meet the need in the near future. Number two, this policy does not limit a landlord's ability to screen people with criminal histories, as we've heard over and over. This is a twisted, fear-mongering tactic that has been used to scare people into thinking they are unsafe."
04_03_2019,affordable housing,"People are already living this reality both in private market and in affordable and in the affordable housing Market, so let's talk numbers to your question according to the [ORGANIZATION] DATE1 ORG0 estimates 46.6% of households which we know is an undercount in [ORGANIZATION] our renters. So that is approximately 115,949 people  Of that number, approximately 110,426 households were computed for rent burden. 52.5% of renters are rent burdened, or approximately 57,974 renters."
04_03_2019,homelessness,"We know a woman who has moved six times in [ORGANIZATION]. Each time, she has been rent burdened. Each time she was preparing to move, she was threatened with homelessness due to a lack of housing choice."
04_03_2019,homelessness,She said this policy gives her hope because it will increase her chances of finding a [STREET] to live instead of potentially facing homelessness due to less choices. She has never had an [ORGANIZATION] filed against her for nonpayment of rent. I also want to point out an amazing feat of this long and arduous process.
04_03_2019,affordable housing,"We do not believe this should prevent the [ORGANIZATION] from passing this policy in its attempt to address housing discrimination and economic and racial segregation. We do know  that the status quo does not work. Despite our best efforts to invest in housing access, affordable housing development, vouchers, et cetera, we cannot meet the volume of need that exists."
04_03_2019,affordable housing,"Although this remains true for all of our members, the greatest impact in terms of cost and implementation will be shoulders by providers of affordable housing. While there were non-profit housing providers that participated in the beta testing, those were largely social service oriented organizations with dual missions of housing and supportive services. By the nature of their good work, these organizations already have screening criteria similar to or even less restrictive than the low barrier screening criteria recommended in Commissioner [PERSON]'s proposal and as such would not be impacted."
04_03_2019,affordable housing,"However, a vast number of affordable communities which house tens or possibly hundreds of thousands of people do not operate this [STREET].  and are simply offering affordable housing to residents who would otherwise be priced out of the market. These providers are not currently prepared with the resources that it will take to implement these proposals. Early analysis indicates that, for example, a provider with 600 affordable units will see an increase in screening-related costs of $60,000 a year."
04_03_2019,affordable housing,"If the law is implemented,  immediately or in short term. It would provide thousands of housing providers including affordable housing providers the need to expend more money on legal services because they will not have the time to modify their forms, their policies, their procedures or to train their  We support the goal of increasing access to rental housing for all Oregonians. However, complicated policies will result in disinvestment of rental properties rather than finding ways to increase supply."
04_03_2019,affordable housing,"We believe that there is certainly more work to do to create a more equitable access to housing. However, with the complexity of this proposal coupled with the many consequences it could create, we implore you to assemble a broader group to work collaboratively to ensure that smaller rental providers do not leave the city due to regulations they can't implement and our affordable housing providers are not forced to reduce the vital services that help residents stay in their homes. Thank you for your time [ORGANIZATION]."
04_03_2019,homeless,"As rental vacancy rates have plummeted and housing has become less and less affordable, our clients are struggling to meet these needs. Some of them are homeless, some of them home ownership is simply out of reach. Many barriers contribute to these situations but  A couple of them are your focus [ORGANIZATION] and are important to address."
04_03_2019,homeless; housing crisis; affordable housing,"We're your partner in [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] in our collective response to the homeless and housing crisis. We also help provide increased economic security for the diverse communities living in [PERSON]. I'm here [ORGANIZATION] to speak from our perspective, both as a provider of services and as an owner and operator of affordable housing, in effect a landlord."
04_03_2019,homelessness,"We really have a dual role in this and a bit of a dual perspective, but I'll try to bring those together and do it all in now [DATE]. From our service provider perspective, we see the impact of the current screening practices. Our shelters and housing programs support families and individuals experiencing homelessness."
04_03_2019,affordable housing,"They're punished once for the sentence that they serve for their offense. They're punished a second time in an ongoing [STREET] in that that sentence continues to serve as a barrier to both housing and employment. And we think that this measure sets a reasonable new bar for,  particularly with the low barrier criteria that are very similar to what we use as an affordable housing provider to provide clear access and also clear rules of the [STREET] for how renters will come up against the screening criteria."
04_03_2019,affordable housing,"Over to how we see this as a landlord and an affordable housing provider. As we shared with [ORGANIZATION] during the process, myself and many of our colleagues already do use selection criteria that are less restrictive than what this policy would require. In fact, we are required by our public funders to use income to rent ratio of 1.5 to 1."
04_03_2019,affordable housing,"I'm going to say something real fast and just say, we know that this policy will continue to screen folks out. They don't have housing options. Our publicly funded affordable housing system should be their first option."
04_03_2019,affordable housing,"Unfortunately, many formerly incarcerated people struggle to find stable places to live. Part of the work focuses on assisting individuals who have been released from jail or prison to reintegrate back into the community. Part of the integration is the ability to find clean and safe affordable housing."
04_03_2019,affordable housing,"Discrimination, and combined with affordable housing shortages, continues to [STREET] the exclusion of formerly incarcerated people from the housing market. A big part of the problem is that property owners have the ability to implement their own screening criteria to determine if an applicant merits housing, a process that relies on criminal record checks as a primary source of information. Thank you."
05_23_2019,homeless,"So the non-conforming upgrades are just a little bit too much for some property owners.  safety, connections, roadway and public realm improvements. And I would say that of all of these listed here, that is the number one issue that was conveyed to us was the condition of the [STREET]. And then finally a lot of folks that participated, just the ongoing theme of concerns around the increasing homeless population, a lack of services,"
05_23_2019,affordable housing,"Private preschools are able to easily deny children with disabilities based on...  limited criteria and so it's just especially sad to me that those opportunities are going to be reduced and I really hope we can work to bring them back sorry throughout this budget process I've heard from Portlanders who want to work with the city on stabilizing parks funding and I hope that offer still stands  It's frustrating to see cuts at a time of relative economic prosperity, but I need to point out that that is in no small part due to the federal government divesting in things like affordable housing and transportation and our need to step up and fill in that gap. So there's a greater burden on local government with...  costs increasing faster than revenue."
05_23_2019,houseless,"Not if you're black. Right. not if you're brown, not if you're a young person, not if you are houseless, not if you are powerless in our community."
05_23_2019,homelessness,"It also advances a number of my priorities, including significant investments in supportive housing, including funding for deep rental subsidies and services for people struggling with homelessness, mental health challenges and addiction, continued support for brownfield remediation or work to convert contaminated land into productive community use,  Funding for [ORGANIZATION], which supports film production in [ORGANIZATION]. Seed funding to support [ORGANIZATION], a community-driven plan for redeveloping FAC0 and repairing the damage done by urban renewal. Establishing [ORGANIZATION] position in ORG2 to guide the city's work on age-friendly services and practices."
05_23_2019,homeless; homelessness,"I'm just going to mention a few things that I'm really proud to see pass What first and foremost is full funding for [ORGANIZATION]? Which [ORGANIZATION] served? 35,000 individuals either experiencing or facing imminent homelessness and  Two, we increased funding for the rental services office, which serves landlords and tenants."
05_23_2019,housing crisis,"Tenants make up nearly half of our population. We're in the midst of a housing crisis. It's important that we get this office beyond up and running and to fully functional in order to advance the work we want to, continued work we want to do around tenant protection and housing."
05_10_2017,houseless,"Forget the fact that we have a [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION] What you are doing with [ORGANIZATION]...  or as we now call them, the police, is what we should look at. And you used the guard to punish the houseless."
05_10_2017,homeless,And I thank you for that. More and more radicals means we may think about expanding the homeless. They're expanding the protests at your houses so your police can keep busy.
05_10_2017,affordable housing,"Our general fund request prioritizes resources essential to implement the strategic plan's focus on inclusive economic growth. Thank you, Mayor, for your proposed budget that maintains key citywide economic development functions. The budget also recognizes the importance of implementing strategies and plans we have in [STREET] to assist key areas of the city, including [ORGANIZATION] and action plans in [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION], Old Town, Chinatown, as well as the 45% set-aside for affordable housing."
05_10_2017,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] works closely with our colleagues at [ORGANIZATION], and I see that [ORGANIZATION] is here, so if there are any questions about priorities there, he is available to answer those, to program the timing of the housing set-aside. Looking from [ORGANIZATION], which was the beginning of the revised policy, the [ORGANIZATION] lift, through the completion of all urban renewal areas, we are on track to spend approximately $281 million, or 45% in new [ORGANIZATION] resources, as well as the remaining $20 million from the closeout districts. Taking into account [PERSON] and the proposed [ORGANIZATION] budget, we are largely spending ahead with regard to affordable housing with the exception of [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] areas."
05_10_2017,affordable housing,"And so what have we done in light of that testimony and in terms of changing the mix? Well, let me see if [ORGANIZATION]'s still here. I think [ORGANIZATION] might be able to speak to it from the affordable housing standpoint."
05_10_2017,affordable housing,"And so I look forward to the briefing. I guess...  I generally am biased towards investing in affordable housing for people shut out of the market. We heard from a number of people, including community members, they wanted to see low-barrier homeownership in that district."
04_13_2016,housing crisis,"The housing crisis is more than evident. It affects every person, every institution, and it rips apart the basis of community when relationships are broken by displacement. While this council has put in [STREET] measures to catch people in crisis by increasing the time of notice for rent increases and no-cause evictions, [ORGANIZATION] we will need to maintain a proactive approach."
04_13_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"This council will continue to need to address...  the long-term solutions that prevent homelessness, increase housing options available to individuals, and in turn, open doors of opportunity to our most economically vulnerable community members. DATE0, we will work on policies that create shared opportunity in every community. It may mean more affordable housing in a public transportation-rich area or more public transportation in an infrastructure-poor area."
04_13_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,"And 17% of those respondents said that they had to move because of a rent increase. The final results of the Fair Housing Poll will be available [ORGANIZATION], and we'll be happy to share that with you. So, again, additional policies that might be helpful in addressing some of these housing crisis issues that we're experiencing right now, in addition to educating landlords, would be to implement inclusionary zoning, which I know the city is working on, to consider rent control and other incentive programs to include more affordable housing and high opportunities, and  You could consider instituting a landlord licensing program in order to consistently train all landlords and tenant landlord rights and responsibilities."
04_13_2016,homeless,"Good morning. So I wanted to say, you know, I think it's good to reduce traffic deaths and stuff, but I also wanted to point out that [ORGANIZATION] is directly involved with killing homeless people by having homeless sweeps.  and coordinating a lot of the homeless sweeps so i'd like to see the uh same uh vision of zero deaths for homeless people and uh i think one of the ways that you could do that is by uh stopping a lot of the sweeps because uh sweeps are known for killing people and uh so i think it's kind of a  contradictory that, you know, that motorists and bicyclists and pedestrians are put on this pedestal of safety, but homeless people basically are being killed by these same agencies that are supposedly there to stop traffic fatalities and other stuff, you know?"
04_13_2016,homeless,"So I don't think that the police and police  [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] and all these people should be conducting homeless sweeps and killing people, especially under a homeless state of emergency. And, you know, this is a – I just see one class of citizens and –  all these various groups that get protection, but I don't see the homeless. And you know what?"
04_13_2016,homeless,"The homeless are an all-encompassing group of people, which include every race, gender, you know, sexual preference, et cetera. So, you know, these homeless sweeps are still going on. They're being coordinated by the same people that are supposedly...  all interested in safety issues, you know."
04_13_2016,homeless,"So basically I'm wondering if you guys are going to maybe tell [ORGANIZATION] to stop sweeping homeless people and killing them, because I'd like to see the same vision of zero deaths amongst the homeless that you guys are free to comment if you want. Thanks very much. Mr. [PERSON], I think you're next."
04_13_2016,homelessness,"And those opportunity youth need an opportunity in this community. And for whatever reason, whether it be gang violence, homelessness, drug and alcohol, or just not being able to get along with your family and couch surfing in different places,  We have a very serious problem, a youth employment crisis, and not just the public. And we have stepped up in a big [STREET], Mayor."
04_13_2016,affordable housing,"But when we allow apartment buildings to be built, that increases density, but we require the developer to pay [ORGANIZATION]s. And we have [ORGANIZATION] waivers for affordable housing, but we require that the housing actually be affordable. Okay."
04_13_2016,affordable housing,"So for me, because we're talking about the backward-looking effect of waiving SDCs for utilities, I think it's very important to identify what's the public benefit because we are doing a little bit of cost shifting. I believe that when we waive SDCs for affordable housing with regulatory agreements, there's a clear public interest that's obtained and it's enforceable. I was persuaded during the recession that bringing an illegal industry out into the sunshine and making it conform to our building code and incentivizing them was laudable."
04_13_2016,affordable housing,"Our research showing the low carbon footprints of small dwellings has led us to support [ORGANIZATION] through zoning codes, building codes, financing, appraisals, tours, and survey research. Our [ORGANIZATION] survey research showed that ORG1 owners in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], and [ORGANIZATION] showed that over 80% of these ORG1 owners are providing long-term housing with their accessory dwelling units. Additionally, the survey demonstrated that approximately 16% are providing free or affordable housing with rents below $500 per month."
04_13_2016,affordable housing,"and I think the affordable ish affordable housing issue that's under discussion here kind of meets that criteria what was striking and just looking at the ordinance language was kind of lack of data and  lack of information on enforcement and how to ensure accountability. So I think it's not only meeting a clear and important, you know, goal and benefit for the city, but, you know, just having it, having there be some meat to it, you know, some teeth to it. And then third, to keep in mind the bigger picture, right?"
04_13_2016,affordable housing,"Mr. [PERSON], you're next. So...  I'm all for affordable housing and affordable dwelling units and all that, but I hear a lot about affordable housing, affordable housing, this, that, and the other thing all the time. But the reality of the situation is people cannot afford housing whether it's so-called affordable or not."
04_13_2016,homeless,And there's homeless people that are falling through the cracks. You have an ongoing war against the homeless in this town. There's all these zombie houses you guys are all talking about now.
04_13_2016,affordable housing,"And now they actually own the building. And this was an occupied space that...  community activists and artists and community members took over and revived on their own. So, you know, I'd like to see you guys move beyond just talking about affordable housing."
04_13_2016,homeless; affordable housing,"And when you do talk about affordable housing, actually talk about it being not so affordable for a lot of people. And  Until there actually is affordable housing, maybe we can establish some more homeless camps or rest areas or other places. And for a start, we could take over a couple of these zombie houses and turn them into a community resource that actually benefits homeless people."
04_13_2016,affordable housing,"And it's the perfect kind of affordable housing to slip in discreetly into existing neighborhoods, where it's hard to build any housing. On the short-term rental side –  [ORGANIZATION] obviously has a compliance and enforcement issue on short-term rentals. But the biggest problem is single-family homes being decommissioned and being taken out of the housing market."
04_13_2016,affordable housing,"she's had to leave but  uh she's taken very seriously the concerns uh that were very evident [ORGANIZATION] when hundreds of people came to [ORGANIZATION] to talk about the huge problem our community is having with low income and affordable housing um [ORGANIZATION] our answer i think that given the amounts of money we're talking about and the extreme need it would be appropriate for you to make this last for [LOCATION] unfortunately this housing state of emergency  Hopefully, we'll be better in [LOCATION], but given the 20s plus thousand of low-income and median-income people that are housing distressed right now, we're not going to be looking at a beautiful world [LOCATION] from now where this isn't going to need work. So I think you can feel safe about leaving the original language for a [ORGANIZATION] waiver."
04_13_2016,homeless,"So we need to open up the public forum with legislatures, city and county commissioners, working to incentivize [ORGANIZATION]s that provide low-income housing. And for people who choose to use an [ORGANIZATION] or a private home as an ORG1, we need to really accelerate our efforts to get [ORGANIZATION]s  fair, effective taxation to make those high-profit properties provide public services for the most distressed units. I know that that's a difficult conversation, but in the housing emergency, I think that many of the tens of thousands of low-income people have not heard enough real numbers and statistics, except for the 600 coming [INSTITUTION] beds,  about what we can do for people who are extremely rent-distressed and the numbers of people that – how many people – we still don't have the information from Administrative Judge, Chief Judge [PERSON] and the [ORGANIZATION] [STREET] system about how many people are really getting evictions and finding themselves stuck on the streets."
04_13_2016,affordable housing,And I also appreciate Commissioner [PERSON]'s continuing efforts to ensure that we have a supply of affordable housing. All right. I think the remaining piece that needs to be figured out is the short-term rental piece and also new construction.
04_13_2016,affordable housing,"And again, I'm going to thank many of the staff who were involved in it. We did carve out the exemption for affordable housing and potentially at the expense of large trees, and that is a policy choice that the council has made. There are many issues involving the tree code that need to be addressed sooner rather than later."
04_13_2016,affordable housing,"We're happy to. It's real brief. We have a contract with...  [ORGANIZATION], they were under contract to look at a linkage fee for supporting more affordable housing."
04_13_2016,homeless,"And if somebody left city employment and went to work as a highly paid lobbyist for a big business that does business in the city and makes a lot of money off it, I think people might certainly raise some eyebrows. Right. But if somebody came to work at the city because they're interested in homeless issues and then they got a job at the county working on homeless issues and occasionally they were lobbying the city on how to address homeless issues, I don't think the public would be upset about that at all."
02_28_2018,homeless,"You call for donations of bedrolls and blankets and socks, and yet your police and your subcontractors steal these and other items from the homeless during your audit sweeps. Warming stations are totally inadequate to sustain life. Not enough of them and not open until humans are freezing to death."
02_28_2018,homelessness,"25 degrees is the temperature that you will open these warming centers. The waste of tens of millions of dollars of taxpayer money [ORGANIZATION] in, [ORGANIZATION] out. With no sufficient reduction in homelessness or houselessness, this charge is a waste of government funds."
02_28_2018,houseless,"We are currently sitting in and occupying your office until you come to speak with us about our need for space to establish our self-managed houseless community. And as you receive, this is a reward to each and every one of you for 30 pieces of silver if you resign. We will take your resignations."
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"Each ORG1-unit application comes before [ORGANIZATION] for approval and that's why it's here. In addition to the [ORGANIZATION] tax exemption provided by the ORG1, this project will also receive an exemption of the affordable housing construction excise tax that otherwise would have been due on the affordable units. This project will join 17 other projects that have already been included under ORG2."
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"As the Mayor said, we're pleased to be here with the 17th project under the new [ORGANIZATION] adopted less than or finalized [ORGANIZATION]. This is now bringing 92 units of affordable housing under the program and developments that encompass more than 1,000 total units of  [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] Incentives Manager, is here with me [TIME] to answer any questions you may have. Good morning."
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"Next item, 196. Authorize intergovernmental agreement with [ORGANIZATION] to provide asset management and development consulting services for [ORGANIZATION]-owned properties to satisfy the housing bond production goal. Colleagues, prior to the passage of the housing bond, the [ORGANIZATION] has primarily been a funder of affordable housing and not an owner or developer."
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] has proven expertise in procurement subject to [ORGANIZATION], long-term asset management experience, and development of affordable housing for the most vulnerable populations in [ORGANIZATION]. This allows for immediate management oversight and coordination of the current bond properties, as well as pre-development design work on the Southeast FAC0 and [ORGANIZATION] development. This partnership brings the benefit of both agencies' best practices to the bond framework by creating low-barrier, sustainable, and affordable housing for [ORGANIZATION]ers."
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"Those guidelines have led us to the partnership you have before you [ORGANIZATION]. Before we talk about the specifics of this intergovernmental agreement, I wanted to share with you the broad outline of some of our bond goals as a reminder. [ORGANIZATION] is [ORGANIZATION]'s first voter-approved measure for affordable housing."
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"For instance, a family of two would be making less than $20,000 a year to qualify for a deeply affordable unit under the housing bond. 300 units will be set aside for individuals and families that require supportive housing, and 650 units will be sized for families. I wanted to also give you a little update on the progress that we have under the affordable housing bond."
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"To date, we've acquired the [ORGANIZATION] apartment complex, converting 263 apartments into permanent housing. We have purchased a site at [ORGANIZATION] and FAC1 for the development of an estimated 200 new units. And [TIME], we're also announcing that we have entered into an agreement for the purchase of a property in [ORGANIZATION] for a new development for at least 75 units of affordable housing."
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"I was trying to create a house, but it didn't quite come out the [STREET] it intended. So in practice, we will use our framework and the policies developed with our community and our bond oversight committee for the foundation of all of this work. And then when needed, as for example, on the [ORGANIZATION] and FAC1 site, we will jointly work with [ORGANIZATION], who, as the mayor mentioned, is uniquely situated to help us both with public contracting and procurement and has a deep expertise in affordable housing development."
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"Then once we develop the building, have a building, [ORGANIZATION] will step in with professional asset management services. [ORGANIZATION] performs this function for over 6,000 existing units of affordable housing and will bring their expertise and commitment to resident success to help us provide for the long-term health of both the bond assets and for the tenants who reside in our buildings. PERSON0, before you move off that slide."
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"So that's one category. Another model is how we finance affordable housing development, where we put public resources in, but the nonprofit developer, sometimes for-profit, but mostly nonprofit developer, has an asset management, property management agreement. So complaints from tenants go to the nonprofit."
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"Yes. And I think the city only has two affordable housing developments under city lights where we're the owner. So now we're the owner, and we're delegating to [ORGANIZATION] this function of asset management."
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"That means getting housing built and acquired that meets a host of goals in the immediate term, from bedroom sizes to geography to population priorities, and making sure that we have our eye on the long-term horizon so they remain affordable housing assets in the community for [ORGANIZATION]. We live and breathe that work at [ORGANIZATION]. And it's hard, and we bring the benefit of many hard-won lessons from [LOCATION] of doing that."
02_28_2018,housing crisis; affordable housing,"And so we thank you for your trust in us to help you do this work. And I know I don't need to tell anyone on this council that the housing crisis that we are facing is the result of [ORGANIZATION] of massive federal disinvestment. affordable housing, but it bears being said publicly as often as possible."
02_28_2018,homelessness,"We continue to struggle with the perception that the crisis of housing and homelessness reflects some kind of local failure. And it is true that we need more done locally. And part of the reason it's important to deliver successfully on this bond is because we need public confidence and support for a regional housing bond, for a dedicated revenue source to fund services for supportive housing, and more."
02_28_2018,housing crisis,"We went from deindustrialization. a policy of not wanting to institutionalize people to a policy of wanting to have community-based facilities to a policy of repealing everything that we committed to so there was no policy. I was at a forum [TIME] where a good number of people blamed the city for the housing crisis, and I thought this is [ORGANIZATION] vision."
02_28_2018,affordable housing,We build from scratch. But the goal when we have housing that's existing is to preserve it as affordable housing. And so housing that may be lower income.
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"I'm using this as a pejorative, but lower income housing [ORGANIZATION], there's no reason why a developer couldn't come in there, do a complete reconstruction of that, evict everybody, and then have it be much higher cost housing. And we do weigh the relative cost and benefits, but our objective there is to really preserve what is there as affordable housing permanently. But I see your larger point."
02_28_2018,homeless,I also appreciate the fact that it was pointed out yet again that it is the federal government's responsibility and that people can move here and people become homeless here.  or are at danger of losing their housing because of factors that are beyond the control of the city council. And I believe we all need to accept that it's not just the politicians who are making the decisions that result in this huge need or the [STREET] to fix it. So thank you very much for everybody who's willing to stay in the fight for as long as it takes.
02_28_2018,homelessness,"Bye. I can't think of a better partner than [ORGANIZATION], so I enthusiastically support this. The city of [ORGANIZATION] has embarked on a multibillion-dollar campaign to address homelessness, and the most recent numbers are completely discouraging."
02_28_2018,homelessness,They've had a spike in homelessness because this problem is not just about housing. It's about poverty. It's about mental health.
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"It's about addiction. It's about a whole host of things. We cannot solve this problem alone.  alone, the President's budget, which would result in a 20 percent cut to [ORGANIZATION], and eliminate all the tools that we use for affordable housing development, homes, CDBG, and other things."
02_28_2018,affordable housing,And I think we need a little less character building and a little more investment in affordable housing if we're going to solve this crisis. I just cannot believe it. [ORGANIZATION] would be turning in his grave if he was listening to this discussion.
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"Commissioner, I don't have a second amendment but I just want to put it on the table there that I think that as we go to implementing these pieces we are going to need to think about how do we encourage  individuals and groups to move out of spaces when they become successful. I know that we found this with affordable housing, that we don't necessarily have appropriate checks and balances so that once an organization is established and thriving, there needs to be an incentive to them to move somewhere so that the next generation of new makers and...  artists can move into that property. And so I think throughout the recommendations, that will happen through the implementation phase."
02_28_2018,unhoused,"A struggle even more pronounced for black, brown, indigenous, [ORGANIZATION] artists, queer and trans, disabled, poor, unhoused, and immigrant artists. We appreciate that [ORGANIZATION] recognizes the urgency of the situation and is initiating a conversation at the municipal level about how to address the lack of affordable, accessible space for artists and organizations because art institutions and artists cannot solve this problem alone. We need direct financial investment, subsidy, and advocacy from the city as well as a voice at the table."
02_28_2018,homeless,"And we would have been desperately looking for a new home like so many other local art nonprofits and artist-run spaces. As some of you know, if not for a 16,000 square foot warehouse at [ORGANIZATION] and FAC0 that we were generously leased rent-free for [ORGANIZATION] by a visionary local philanthropist, we might too be homeless, literally. This building is a gift to [ORGANIZATION]."
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"Affordable housing and family wage jobs, all of these things which allow artists and people of all backgrounds to live and thrive in the city. As [ORGANIZATION] has now said, diversity of all kinds is the key. Thank you for recognizing there are some barriers that naturally exist within the government structure."
02_28_2018,homeless,"And having been one of the administrators of [ORGANIZATION], when it was still around, I can...  add to that story of how challenging it is to keep creative spaces open, as well as what it feels like to become homeless when [ORGANIZATION], who you heard from earlier, was also affected by the loss of theater theater, which I certainly hope part four of the affordable art space, the incentivizing creative landlords, will go to help  make sure that we don't lose more of the arts spaces. And so to finalize, I just want to say thank you, and thank you to everybody who is here and lending their voices so strongly in support of keeping the creative heart of [ORGANIZATION] that has brought so many here. And unfortunately, we mourn for those who have had to move away because of rising costs."
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"Okay. Item 204, amend to make permanent the mandatory relocation assistance for invol[ORGANIZATION]tary displacement of tenants [ORGANIZATION]der affordable housing preservation and [ORGANIZATION] renter protections. Colleagues, [PERSON] will take up a set of policies that are designed to protect tenants in an increasingly [ORGANIZATION]-affordable rental market."
02_28_2018,housing crisis,"This supports the council's current policy around maintaining existing density in our neighborhoods. Second of all, we're exempting all auxiliary dwelling units, otherwise known as ADUs,  on a property where, once again, the owner is in residence. The city has long had a policy of increasing ADUs as a [STREET] to alleviate the housing crisis and increase our housing stock."
02_28_2018,housing crisis,People have older relatives. Adult children are struggling in the midst of this housing crisis. People need to support their families.
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"Sixth, if an affordable housing unit is already regulated by the federal, state, or local government, that should be exempt. Seventh, if a dwelling unit is rendered uninhabitable through no fault of the landlord, this too is exempt. It's not just natural disasters we're talking about."
02_28_2018,housing crisis,"I look forward to having [ORGANIZATION] in monitoring the continued future of our relocation policy. And I'm going to continue to work for advocates both on the renter and owner sides of this equation, along with property management companies and professionals on the tools that can aid us nationally, at the state level, and most especially at the local level to help us to continue to address this housing crisis. My belief is that housing is a human right."
02_28_2018,housing crisis,"We allowed an unregulated market to dictate what happened to children and to seniors and people with disabilities on fixed incomes. We weren't protecting some of the most vulnerable members of our community, which is our primary job as far as I'm concerned. When we introduced relocation assistance [ORGANIZATION] as a step toward increasing stability and the chances that families could afford to find a new home, we knew it wasn't going to solve our housing crisis."
02_28_2018,homelessness,"We only hoped that it would stem the tide of cost-burdening displacement and homelessness, especially for the 25% of our residents currently struggling to afford the roofs over their heads. Because of state interference with our local power to regulate and manage our rental housing market, relocation assistance was virtually the only tool left at our disposal. And I'm so grateful to my colleagues for recognizing its value in supporting this effort."
02_28_2018,housing crisis,"There has not been [ORGANIZATION], and this is not an exaggeration, that has gone by since this policy was originally passed that our office hasn't received a phone call or an email about relocation assistance. As expected, some but not all landlords are unhappy with it. Also, as expected, many tenants thank us for providing a modicum of stability and security amidst this unprecedented DATE1-and-counting housing crisis."
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"It's a crisis that's driven by many circumstances beyond our control.  from the federal government abandoning its obligation to fund affordable housing, to growing income inequality, to huge Wall [STREET] investment firms and foreign investors buying up our real estate and rental properties. We are also facing as a city the ultimate outcome of social engineering through discriminatory public policy,  that began [ORGANIZATION]. We are not responsible for creating that policy, but we are responsible for the remedy, and this is part of it."
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"So those are some of the larger modifications that don't relate to the exemptions. Again, looking at the exemptions, just to kind of go through really quick, the single-unit exemption was eliminated, and there are 11 exemptions in here. The owner-occupied duplex, the owner-occupied site where there are ADUs, ADUs when the owner is on the site, landlord renting a primary residence during absence of not more than three years, and military service, moving in an immediate family member, regulated affordable housing."
02_28_2018,affordable housing,Can you go back one bullet? I don't understand this. DATE0 of regulated affordable housing.
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"So if it's affordable housing and it's regulated by the federal government, the state government, or the local government, for [ORGANIZATION] it will be exempt from relocation assistance payments. So if it's [PERSON]? Then it is not exempt in the ordinance."
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"And, you know, most regulated affordable housing is exempt anyway, given the provisions in the lease about having to make only a certain amount of money. And most events that an agency that owns and operates regulated housing would come with federal relocation requirements. And so most regulated affordable housing would be already exempt, but there was some request for clarification in the code, just because there was some confusion in the earlier versions, and so we wanted to add that in to clarify that."
02_28_2018,homelessness; housing crisis,"DATE0, we stabilized about 250 low-income seniors in housing, preventing their potential homelessness. And we also placed into housing another 250 low-income seniors from a situation of homelessness. And that was in [LOCATION] housing DATE2 and a housing crisis."
02_28_2018,homeless,"We also had a few cases of landlords choosing not to end a lease because of the potential of triggering relocation. I can't emphasize really enough how important it's been for our clients, for whom...  a significant rent increase or a move not of their choice puts them at risk of being homeless. And that's one of the things that we see as an important role in what we do."
02_28_2018,housing crisis,"It's no longer the big little city that I moved to as a young adult in [ORGANIZATION]. That's led to record level of tourism, record level of commercial real estate investment, record level of multifamily real estate investment, and at the end has resulted in a housing crisis. I don't think that that can be ignored."
02_28_2018,housing crisis,"When we're facing an economic shift like we've seen, the onus is on leaders of our city to provide new tools to combat what's going on. I do believe that the relocation policy is the best tool that we have to treat what I believe is the largest symptom of a housing crisis, which is displacement. By no means do I believe this is a comprehensive tool, but it's the only tool that we have that directly affects the biggest...  problem I see that our community faces."
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"I think we need to create more tools. I think Mayor [PERSON], your recent public announcement of being invested in the framework building in [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] over by FAC0, your state legislation to combine different forms of government financing as another tool to provide more supply to the market. And I like the fact that you're looking at that from a comprehensive standpoint."
02_28_2018,housing crisis,"As advocates for tenants, especially those most impacted by the housing crisis, for many of us this crisis is not new, it has stretched [ORGANIZATION] for people of color and those with barriers to housing. And we believe that the permanent relocation ordinance before us DATE1 is an important step forward toward the symbiotic housing relationship we wish to see between landlords and tenants. We're hopeful that this policy sets a precedent, and we believe it prioritizes a healthy balance in a severely unbalanced relationship right now in the state of [ORGANIZATION], despite the long-term tools that we need."
02_28_2018,homelessness,"We are supportive of permanent relocation policy for the following reasons. Of course, the reasons that Mayor [PERSON] mentioned [ORGANIZATION]. In addition, involuntary displacement affects us all as a community, especially when it leads to homelessness."
02_28_2018,homelessness,"We believe and have seen and we've all experienced the externalities created by a business decision between one person and another, and we don't believe that it has to continue to fall on the rest of the population to make up that burden. Relocation assistance also helps to increase the likelihood of successful relocation for tenants in unexpected crisis. Involuntary displacement due to a rent increase or no-cause termination can not only be anxiety-provoking and create homelessness or transience, but it creates a situation where sometimes they're not able to relocate and they end up on our streets."
02_28_2018,housing crisis; affordable housing,"And the city of [ORGANIZATION] has identified its commitment to equity. Um, first our city and community have expressed a commitment to supporting those most impacted by the housing crisis and the city, um, has boldly claimed equity goals. However, the current long-term policy includes a flat exemption for federal state and local regulated affordable housing, um, for [ORGANIZATION] in subsection G eight."
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"If anyone needs relocation the most, even in nuanced circumstances, it is this population. Due to severe shortage of affordable housing that is both regulated and market rate, when families are displaced from affordable housing, they most often have to relocate to market rate housing, or they end up on the streets or end up on the couches, often sometimes ending up on waiting lists that can be [ORGANIZATION]. Relocation payments are critical in these scenarios as they are the least likely population to be able to save for an unexpected displacement event and are already scraping by."
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"As advocates for this population for [ORGANIZATION], we know that exempting them from support during voluntary displacement could be one of the biggest mistakes we make as a city. [ORGANIZATION] never talked about a straight exemption, and we talked through different nuances or different circumstances in which there should be or could be additional support. So [PERSON] is requesting that this language be stricken from the code, and we specifically request that council mandate ORG2 to take up the issue with local affordable housing providers to talk through this more nuanced language that addresses the issues highlighted in ORG3 during deliberation in [LOCATION].  around federal changes, rent changes, income changes, and more."
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"I think we're talking about a number of groups. And in transparency, I emailed some of these affordable housing providers to let them know that we would be taking this position. And one indicated interest in engaging in this process of talking with [ORGANIZATION] to develop this nuanced language."
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"What I can share with you is that we have had several members within [ORGANIZATION] who have received rent increases and regulated affordable housing that has caused a displacing event that forced them to relocate into private market housing. So we have seen it on the ground, and it is very distressing. Some folks..."
02_28_2018,homeless,"I believe one person that I can think of off the top of my head did end up homeless. Yeah. And one of the scenarios that we're trying to avoid is in a circumstance where there is an actual income restriction, and that's not always the case."
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"When the household income exceeds that restricted level, they either have to move out or the nonprofit affordable housing organization  property manager loses the tax exemption on that property. So that's a scenario where I think an exemption makes sense because it would be a burden to that housing provider  There are definitely some nuanced situations in which I think exemptions are appropriate, but there are some others that a flat exemption does not include in which relocation would be extremely necessary. Okay."
02_28_2018,affordable housing,And so that's why we're recommending that [ORGANIZATION] take this up with affordable housing providers to talk through those and include it in the language. Great. Thank you.
02_28_2018,housing crisis,That's my practice area. Okay. I've seen from working with clients directly the devastating impact that the housing crisis has had on the most vulnerable members of our community.
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"Why don't you come on up? I guess I'm inclined to want to delete the exemption that relates to  Dwelling unit regulated as affordable housing by a federal, state, or local government. for a period of [ORGANIZATION]."
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"So the regulated affordable housing is actually regulated on an attendance income level, and it's allowed to go up based on the MFIs and a number of different things in a regulatory agreement. We don't think that it's a significant factor and that this amendment is actually necessary. However, our affordable housing partners are extremely concerned about the removal of this amendment and quite frankly have some concerns about the length and duration of [ORGANIZATION]."
02_28_2018,affordable housing,We don't necessarily regulate all of the affordable housing in the city of [ORGANIZATION]. Much of it was created by the city. created before the [ORGANIZATION] requirement happened.
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"I'm particularly thinking of some properties with [ORGANIZATION] contracts, et cetera, that may be owned by a partner like ORG1. It's clearly a policy choice by this council, but it is something that our folks in the community who are providing affordable housing in partnership with the city are extremely concerned that this is –  I believe the removal would be problematic for them, and that's what I can... Don't these entities issue no-cause evictions?"
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] would definitely be included, but it would be any regulated affordable housing as long as it was affordable for a period of [ORGANIZATION]. But that would include many of [ORGANIZATION]'s units as well as many other affordable housing providers in the community. Like nonprofit providers?"
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"So, yes, you could have a scenario where somebody is earning very little money. Maybe they're working part-time and they're in regulated affordable housing, or maybe they're not working at all. And so the subsidy that is helping them stay in the rental unit is covering most of the housing cost."
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"And then when they see a significant increase in their income, their lease agreement should—and  Again, I don't know what all of the lease agreements say between the providers of affordable housing. We don't have a full list. compilation of all the terms of the lease agreement, but in that scenario they would have to pay 30% of their [ORGANIZATION] income toward rent."
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"And that could be a significant increase, but that is the policy framework under which a lot of affordable housing with subsidy built in is regulated. And then there's the other scenario that I already mentioned, which is that the income goes up so much that they no longer qualify for  for the subsidy in that housing provider would either have to pay RELO or they would lose their tax-exempt status. Those are two scenarios that I think are reasonable for us to want to avoid."
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"That is another scenario where we need to – I mean, the virtue of regulated units is that once individuals are making enough money, that we can move a new family in. We have a deficit of 23,000 affordable housing units in the city. And so part of this, that was that sense of, well, as people can earn income and move into the private market, we need – this is what we heard from some of the affordable housing providers."
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"Is it an urgent issue that needs to be resolved [TIME] without the benefit of a lot of information? Or can we choose either to keep it in or keep it out and come back with some feedback from our affordable housing partners to better understand the issue? Because I have a feeling – Yeah, and that was my proposed amendment."
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"So what's the harm in taking it out altogether and just putting a [ORGANIZATION] clock on bringing back something that we can all understand that's tailored to the situation that our nonprofit and federal partners have raised? That is an option that is available to you. I will, again, reiterate just from the affordable housing partners I talked to, they are very concerned about this provision."
02_28_2018,affordable housing,And our intent was the [ORGANIZATION] policy was not to cover those shorter-term durations of  things that are the DATE1 tax exemptions that the city gives or otherwise. The intent was for long-term committed affordable housing providers. And so even this was a compromise that our providers are not particularly pleased with.
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"But let's face it, there's also a lot of landlords that have been out there providing affordable housing for a long time too. And we're sort of saying...  We're going to not be so concerned about what the policies and practices of the nonprofits as we are with the for-hire or for-profits. So I think it's fair to strike it and educate us all about it because it is – we obviously need more education about the issue here."
02_28_2018,housing crisis; affordable housing,"In my opinion, this proposal is not a win-win solution to a housing crisis that we face. It's not a win-lose issue for either tenants' rights, affordable housing advocates, or landlords. In my opinion, this proposal is a lose-lose issue that negatively affects all small landlords and tenants in [ORGANIZATION] combined."
02_28_2018,housing crisis,"I am here [ORGANIZATION] with [ORGANIZATION], or [ORGANIZATION], to urge your support for the mandatory relocation assistance that ensures all renters are permanently protected from forced displacement. They tell us in medical school that patients are our best teachers, and there have been no better teacher to the plague of our housing crisis than a patient I'll call [ORGANIZATION]. I met [ORGANIZATION] DATE1 of residency, where his medical diagnosis read like a laundry list of chronic conditions."
02_28_2018,houseless,"But on [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION] like this one, I know he is more likely to be houseless on the streets, his chronic conditions deteriorating. So they tell us during residency that patients are our best teachers, and [ORGANIZATION] was an exceptional teacher. But I have failed [ORGANIZATION]'s test, and I refuse to fail again."
02_28_2018,homeless,Three women did help me out and I was appreciative of this. I am homeless right now because of not getting relocation assistance. I am homeless now because of bigotry and there are landlords out there that  are not using the law.
02_28_2018,housing crisis,"These protections have brought struggling tenants relief by reducing severe rent increases and no-cost evictions. [ORGANIZATION] is a good beginning, but our rental housing crisis and our unequal tenant-landlord relationship demands additional protections. I am...  I'm going to talk about my experiences with maintenance and the safety of the homes that some of these landlords fail to do."
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"So we provide safe, stable, and affordable housing for people that are evicted. And I don't worry about that when I'm dealing with these people that are in recovery. For me to have to worry about a relocation fee when there is a problem with recovery, it's an issue for all of us, and it does affect my business greatly."
02_28_2018,affordable housing,My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I've been providing affordable housing in the local area for [ORGANIZATION]. I'm urging you not to extend the emergency ordinance.
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"I aim to provide clean, comfortable, safe, and affordable housing to my tenants. In this capacity, I also take on significant financial risk. In return, I seek a modest profit."
02_28_2018,housing crisis,"With the [ORGANIZATION]-to-[ORGANIZATION] cost of living, including the cost of housing in this area, these workers and their families do not have the ability to create and maintain the resources to self-finance two [ORGANIZATION]s of rent, deposits, and the other costs associated with an involuntary move. The members of my union adopted as official union policy an acknowledgment that there is a housing crisis in [ORGANIZATION], that this is clearly a working family issue, which especially presents a hardship to low-income workers, and that this crisis needs immediate and meaningful solutions, including better protection of tenants' rights and welfare. The fact that there's a longstanding housing crisis in [ORGANIZATION] means that the current system of providing housing to our city's population is inadequate."
02_28_2018,homeless,"No-cause evictions are similar to homeless sweeps. Evictions and sweeps cause undue stress or even trauma, and in extreme cases, death. There's been several deaths [ORGANIZATION] from just people dying from exposure."
02_28_2018,housing crisis,Our sales are doing quite well [ORGANIZATION]. The housing crisis is a simple supply and demand economics. The ordinance is nothing to address the housing crisis and only makes small landlords like myself want to get out of the business.
02_28_2018,homeless,"But boy, it would sure be easier to just sort of do it once and be done. The other thing is, I have a homeless guy living...  sheltering himself in my garage, since my garage would be considered, in quotes, uninhabitable. But he uses my kitchen and my bathroom, and it keeps him from sleeping in people's doorways in the neighborhood."
05_25_2017,affordable housing,"Thank you, gentlemen, for your patience and thank you for coming back [ORGANIZATION]. Please read the next item, which is our one and only time-certain item for [TIME]. Item 564, amend relocation assistance regulations in affordable housing preservation and [ORGANIZATION] renter protections."
05_25_2017,affordable housing,"If a tenant is opting for additional services such as a pet fee, an additional parking stall, or storage, that's also not the landlord increasing the rent. And lastly, we flagged that...  Affordable housing and regulated affordable housing have limited applicability under relocation assistance, mostly because usually the federal, state, or local level is setting the income eligibility and the maximum rent that can be charged under those situations. So technically it would not be the landlord increasing the rent up to that 10%."
05_25_2017,homelessness,"So in a sense, it did provide support for mitigating the impact of no-cause evictions. In terms of, I think it's a little bit too premature to see if there was any long-term effect, whether it increased the housing stability of families or prevented families from moving into homelessness, because obviously the cost of moving is really, really high. And a lot of families, particularly the families that we work with and serve, still face very high barriers to getting into housing and maintaining housing in terms of financial perspective."
05_25_2017,homeless,"I think we have to think equitably about the,  that people are facing. We're talking about families that could potentially be homeless if they don't receive relocation assistance versus an organization or a landlord keeping with accounting procedures or operations. It's very, very different in nature."
05_25_2017,housing crisis,"And I brought to the council's attention in the past major corporations that have impacts all over the world, and our council can draw attention to the dangers, and instead our council's history is very poor in [ORGANIZATION]. They brought in [ORGANIZATION] when I brought out the point that they were criminals in [PERSON] on a natural gas explosion, which was ignored. In this housing crisis, who are the players?"
05_25_2017,homelessness,"If we extend the notice period to [ORGANIZATION] for the tenant and the time frame for the landlord to [ORGANIZATION] and the tenant doesn't receive relocation assistance until [LOCATION] before their move-out date... And we say that if they overstay their notice period, they have to refund the full amount of the relocation. We are setting them up for failure and potential homelessness."
05_25_2017,homelessness,"The original intent of the ordinance was to create an opportunity for tenants to avoid homelessness and other potential harms that an unexpected displacement causes, as such prescribing that the tenants receive that relocation money in a time frame that allows them the flexibility to find another home is paramount. While we agree that tenants could use [ORGANIZATION] by which to decide if they can absorb a rent increase,  Giving the landlords additional time as suggested creates a situation where a tenant might not receive relocation until they are [LOCATION] into a DATE2 notice period. With a no-cause eviction notice, a tenant receives the money in [LOCATION], exactly in the middle of the DATE2 notice period."
05_25_2017,housing crisis,"That's what triggers RELO. If they don't want to do that, then they shouldn't do either of those things. Once they do one of those things and they risk involuntarily displacing a tenant...  adding to our housing crisis and burdening or triggering that reload, they will know we have [ORGANIZATION] to write this check."
05_24_2017,homeless,My name is [ORGANIZATION]. We are students at [ORGANIZATION]. We are here to tell you about the [ORGANIZATION] homeless crisis.
05_24_2017,homeless,"It is very noticeable, and it's getting worse and worse. And we have to do something about it. We are here to tell you some solutions we have come up with to give more homeless people homes and give them education to get them back on their feet."
05_24_2017,homeless,"There are people that are homeless because of luck. But there are people that are homeless because of drugs, drinking, and losing things that they already have. So why don't we care about the homeless?"
05_24_2017,homeless,"They're people too, and they should deserve what we get. If we look down at them, it makes not only them unhappy, but us too. We will start overflowing with homeless on the [STREET], so it's time to take action and make a difference."
05_24_2017,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] is the second worst in the country at providing shelters for the homeless. There is 620,000 homeless in [ORGANIZATION], but we only have about 15 homeless shelters and two family shelters. Only 60.5% of [ORGANIZATION]'s homeless have a shelter to sleep in [TIME]."
05_24_2017,homeless,"A [INSTITUTION] is a [STREET] where you can go when times are rough, but think about if you have a family. You don't want to separate from your family, and that's why we need more family shelters. It is scary to leave your family and live alone, and that's why we need more family shelters."
05_24_2017,homeless,"But regular shelters don't offer that, and that has to change, because everyone deserves to have a roof over their head and some education. In conclusion, we have come up with a couple of solutions to help get homeless people off the streets. Our first solution is to simply get more family shelters in [ORGANIZATION]."
05_24_2017,affordable housing,"At that time, we couldn't find any affordable housing there. after the war was over. So we moved to [ORGANIZATION], which was affordable at the time."
05_24_2017,housing crisis,"I want to thank you for joining me in advocating for the ballot measure. I want to particularly thank all the editorial boards that took up the issue, looked at it critically and gave us a thumbs up and helped us convince the voters this was the right thing to do. The money that we will ultimately collect in ensuring that there's a level playing field and there's tax fairness,  will be money that we use to provide basic services, but in particular will help us address our housing crisis."
05_24_2017,affordable housing,So it does become a labor of love for the community rather than for one that particularly benefits folks. I'm excited about this one. It's just up the hill from the FAC0 affordable housing complex that was developed [ORGANIZATION].
05_24_2017,housing crisis,"Private disinvestment has been part of it too. So just to understand, [LOCATION] right now are some of the most vulnerable renters in the city. They're right in the crosshairs of the housing crisis that we've been seeing."
05_24_2017,homeless,"I will not fight like militarized police force, but as a citizen with a voice. The city, county, state, country will hear not only for my people, but for all the silent voices.  for brown people, homeless, for our mentally ill, again, for those silenced, unable to speak from the grave. I will be the strong voice in this."
05_24_2017,homeless,"You chose this job because our governor was scared you would run against her. But since you have this job voting in by the citizens of [ORGANIZATION], you have a duty to us. Your job should go to the kid on his knees, the visitor with the afro, terrorized by your police, the homeless, the people being beat up, stabbed to the ground, arrested for protesting, and my personal favorite, wants to be shot by a cop."
05_24_2017,homeless,"But why did they arrest him in the first [STREET]? I don't understand. Why is it that my family gets together [ORGANIZATION], makes little bags of candy, and take it downtown and pass it out to the homeless?"
05_24_2017,houseless,"[ORGANIZATION] was [ORGANIZATION] and on his knees when officers thought he was going for a weapon, even though they had their sniper rifle pointed at him and thus had the advantage, even if he truly was armed. [PERSON] was [PERSON] and houseless and perhaps living with mental illness. He allegedly displayed a utility knife and was killed."
05_24_2017,houseless,"Including PERSON0 death in custody, that means of 38 deadly force incidents, 26% of the subjects, and 26% of those who died were African American. Three other people identified as people of color were killed, were shot or killed, which means 34% of people shot, shot at, or killed by police were people of color in a city that's 77% white. We count at least six houseless persons, including Mr. [PERSON], who have been killed since [ORGANIZATION], none of whom were armed with guns."
06_01_2017,affordable housing,"And I want to be clear, we pursue generative capacity. the ability to [STREET] renewable energy infrastructure into low-income people and people of color neighborhoods in response to that specific community's priorities, which may be health, may be education, may be housing, may be economic opportunity. I think we all can imagine a future where renewable energy infrastructure is actually a key piece of how we fund new affordable housing."
06_01_2017,affordable housing,"I think you've all done a wonderful job. I think that one of the last gentlemen mentioned that our affordable housing stock should have some of this considered into it, and our micro communities do have this solar energy collection, water collection, and all that. So I'll cut it short and say thank you."
06_01_2017,houseless,"For shelters for the houseless, we can have zero carbon footprint with having bales, hay, straw, hemp, weed, not as in pop, and having sand and earth structures. We can include more lighting, so we use less electricity with our...  are reflective and magnification. We can have green ways that are going to have more resilience against the multiple earthquakes and the explosions and fires from the methane gas pipelines that we have so that we have  not only infrastructure for cooling and for cleaning our air and reducing the energy that has to be used, but also for internal refugee camps for folks who are waiting [ORGANIZATION] in between housing."
03_07_2018,houseless,"Please read the first communications. Item 206, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding alternative housing for houseless individuals. And I believe, if I'm not mistaken, [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] have asked..."
03_07_2018,houseless,"207, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel regarding alternative housing for houseless individuals. And 208, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel regarding alternative housing for houseless individuals. Okay.  Very good."
03_07_2018,affordable housing,"Thank you, tenant, for your presentation. Next item, number 220. Amend to make permanent the mandatory relocation assistance for involuntary displacement of tenants under affordable housing preservation and [ORGANIZATION] renter protections."
03_07_2018,affordable housing,"And that was moved by Commissioner [PERSON] and seconded by myself. Commissioner [PERSON] has offered an amendment, a motion to delete Exemption 30.01.085G, Section 8, for dwelling unit as regulated affordable housing by a federal, state, or local government.  and add a directive that ORG0 come back with a recommendation to council. That was moved by Commissioner [PERSON] and seconded by Commissioner PERSON2."
03_07_2018,affordable housing,"If we can establish a legislative history [ORGANIZATION], I am prepared to withdraw my amendment if this legislative history, which I think is the intent of this amendment, is clarified. So I would request that [ORGANIZATION] work with the affordable housing providers and [ORGANIZATION] to craft a narrow exemption for affordable housing providers for rent increases that may exceed 10%. That would be if that increase does not increase the tenant's portion of the rent, i.e., it's paid for out of the Section 8 voucher, or it's in a circumstance where the rent increase is required due to a change in the tenant's income or due to requirements of a regulatory agreement."
03_07_2018,affordable housing,"I strongly feel the family move-in exemption is too vague and it's could be subject to abuse. This type of exemption is currently causing problems in other cities with similar tenant protections such as [ORGANIZATION], so I request that we take a closer look at that. Thank you, Commissioner [PERSON], for addressing the issue with affordable housing providers."
03_07_2018,affordable housing,"And thank you, [ORGANIZATION], for pursuing that. Obviously, we don't want to penalize affordable housing providers who have to follow certain rules about income-based rents. But we also don't want to leave those tenants with no protections if necessary."
03_07_2018,affordable housing,"In [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] recognized the magnitude of the crisis in our community and declared a housing state of emergency. Since then, we've taken a number of steps to help Portlanders who are struggling to keep up with rising rents and the shortage of affordable housing. We successfully lobbied the state legislature to give us new tools like inclusionary housing, which requires affordable apartments and any new construction."
03_07_2018,homeless,"We worked with the community to pass a $250 million housing bond to fund new affordable homes across our community. We created [ORGANIZATION] to streamline programs and services for our most vulnerable, and we committed record funding to their work. We pledged to bring 2,000 new units of supportive housing online, deeply affordable homes with services for people struggling."
03_07_2018,homelessness; housing crisis,"We need to change the conversation about the landlord-tenant relationship. Our unregulated rental market in no small part has led us to where we are [ORGANIZATION] in an [LOCATION] and counting unprecedented housing crisis and homelessness crisis. We are asking landlords to consider the impact that their decisions have, not just on their tenants, but on our communities and on the city."
03_07_2018,affordable housing,"As Commissioner [PERSON] said, housing is a human right, whether our federal government wants to recognize that or not. It cannot be treated like any other commodity. In fact, we need to treat affordable housing as part of our essential infrastructure."
03_07_2018,housing crisis,"In fact, part of the reason I ran is I felt council was not responding to our housing crisis as a cost burden, you know, that being my perspective as a cost burden tenant. And I'm so relieved to find that they absolutely are ready and willing to do that. After [ORGANIZATION] of working with Commissioner [PERSON], he continues to surprise me with his deep compassion, his brilliant contributions, and his excitement for the work we're doing to help solve this housing crisis."
03_07_2018,affordable housing,But I think we need to have a decision [ORGANIZATION] because [ORGANIZATION] can't wait forever to start addressing our affordable housing shortage in [ORGANIZATION] either. Okay. Good response.
03_07_2018,housing crisis,"Let me state several of them. It is a lie that we cannot address the housing shortage and preserve what [ORGANIZATION] made a wonderful [STREET] to live in the first [STREET]. It is a lie that jamming in a few hundred more housing units on top of a tall building in the core will make a significant debt in our regional housing crisis, whole scale is in the hundreds of thousands."
03_07_2018,affordable housing,We are here to talk about the [ORGANIZATION] [DATE] plan and the need to preserve iconic views. But I would like to talk about the background of where we are and how we got here. We are in a panic to add housing units in order to address the shortage of housing in the region and the growing lack of affordable housing.
03_07_2018,affordable housing,"But members of the council, with respect, your job is to ask hard questions, to learn and grow, and not take these plausible-sounding fallacies at face value. How terrible it would be if we surrender our common heritage, our iconic views, and the quality of our public realm to a privatized regime, and then did not get more affordable housing or better equity, but only an uglier, more divided city. Please consider what a terrible historic mistake that would be."
03_07_2018,affordable housing,"And, uh, in addition, obviously the increased height allows flexibility to gain much needed, affordable housing in the downtown core. And we've obviously heard the concerns about stepping down to the river and the compatibility of the surrounding river or the surrounding neighborhoods. Uh,  So a core part of the amendment is the requirement for master planning, which must go through a public review process."
03_07_2018,affordable housing,"I agree with Commissioner [PERSON] that this transportation system is already super constrained and this would not help it, no.  [PERSON]. Yeah, I'm very skeptical of what we can do on the transportation side. The countervailing concern is that we can get a lot of affordable housing in this site at a time we desperately need it."
03_30_2016,homeless,"For the record, my name is [ORGANIZATION]. I represent [ORGANIZATION]. One of our concerns is we have homeless people living on the river."
03_30_2016,affordable housing,"So one of the things I loved about this, again, if we're successful and based on the investments we've made, there's this downstream benefit to an affordable housing development that's in the catchment area. I thought that was neat. Good work."
03_30_2016,affordable housing,"It is critical that we get this code and we be able to do that in a [STREET] that is supportive of the citizenry as well as the environment. We are supposed to be a green city. We also have land  The issue of affordable housing, I don't think they are mutually exclusive."
03_30_2016,affordable housing,And people who live in affordable housing also deserve a nice environment. My neighborhoods are economically not as advantaged. They are not as old.
03_30_2016,affordable housing,"And it's because we're dedicating millions of dollars to affordable housing. It's okay. Counsel, we are supposed to be moving to the next item."
03_30_2016,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION]'s doing a wonderful job of parroting back there, though, so it's good to know that. So we did send a letter. You know, we appreciate the intent behind Commissioner [PERSON]'s proposed additional amendment regarding affordable housing."
03_30_2016,affordable housing,"Certainly no one wants to [STREET] up the cost of affordable housing, but we think this is the wrong [STREET] to do it. We think we're trading one inequity against another because the neighborhoods that are getting the most affordable housing are also the neighborhoods with the least trees. And I don't think we can pit one inequity against another."
03_30_2016,affordable housing,"And that's our recommendation. Don't just put in the exception for affordable housing. Also, agree to mitigate for those trees that will be lost out of the city's fund if, in fact, we do need to do an exception for an affordable housing complex."
03_30_2016,affordable housing,"If you cut down the one tree that's there, it may be the one tree for blocks and blocks that's big. And so I really think when we do these kinds of things, we can't play this zero-sum game. If we're going to exempt affordable housing, let's also put in [STREET], first of all, very strict standards to make sure that the exemption is really needed in this case, that there's no [STREET] to avoid cutting the tree, and that to me would be a site inspection."
03_30_2016,affordable housing,"It will exempt the inch-by-inch diameter tree mitigation requirement for affordable housing projects.  that are approved for our system development charge waiver due to their affordable housing component the sub substitute are the subtle changes here between what was offered [ORGANIZATION] and [LOCATION] is that one this will prorate the exemption to the percentage of units that actually achieve the [ORGANIZATION] waiver and two the housing director may craft administrative rules that can refine this process as real world circumstances dictate And I also want to point out that the amendment makes clear that the developer must demonstrate to the city that the proposed development cannot be situated on the lot to save the trees in question. And I'm confident that with the improved working relationship between ORG1 and ORG2, that this requirement can be utilized to push hard on developers to save trees."
03_30_2016,affordable housing,"But this says the director of [ORGANIZATION] is adopting the rules. If need be in the real world, basically as it works now, you have to go to [ORGANIZATION] to get your [ORGANIZATION] exemption, and you also need to go to ORG1 to get your permits and your tree, obviously all your permits. They work together, and they basically meet now [ORGANIZATION] to talk about affordable housing projects, and these can easily pop up in those meetings as, hey, we have a developer trying to get the [ORGANIZATION] exemption as well as the tree exemption."
03_30_2016,affordable housing,"I'm very impressed with the work that's been done so far, and I really don't have anything negative to say other than we can bring down the cost for the developers and the builders and the homeowners, and that's one of the ways to do that. One [STREET] to do that is to not make people fence things that really don't need to be fenced. In terms of the stopgap of Commissioner [PERSON]'s amendment, though, you're in favor of not requiring trees to be preserved on affordable housing sites?"
03_30_2016,affordable housing,"I think that when you build affordable housing, it's extremely hard to get anybody to build affordable housing anyway. I think you know that. Unless, of course, it's financed by the city for the most part, whether it's through our own sort of inclusionary zoning non-rules or not."
03_30_2016,affordable housing,"It's very hard to build affordable housing affordably. And so anything that you can do to mitigate those costs, whether it's replacing sidewalks, trees at the sidewalks, or any other thing that you can do to make it more affordable for developers to come in and build affordable housing, yeah, I think it's a good idea. And if the city can help pay to bring new trees in, then yeah."
03_30_2016,affordable housing,"So first of all, I was very concerned. It's not in the letter, but [ORGANIZATION] was raised to you as a reason why we need to exempt affordable housing from the ORG1 charges or that we need to have no policy unlike the proposal from ORG2. I looked at what we gained and lost in that project."
03_30_2016,affordable housing,"So what we gained was we gained seven affordable housing units. What we lost was 2 million gallons of stormwater and all the other issues. So...  Finally, looking at the site plan, trees are cut not for building square footage but for our surface parking lot."
03_30_2016,affordable housing,"That's why we thought we need to have perhaps a look at these because in some cases a large multi-dwelling project with many affordable housing units, you just can't have both. You can't save the trees and have the housing. It's clear."
03_30_2016,affordable housing,"This –  The new [ORGANIZATION] rules could require, as [ORGANIZATION] alluded to, something very much along the lines of a competent city official having a quick discussion. So I do feel that there's a workable solution. I just am concerned that the council not feel compelled to, A, underestimate what we're losing by cutting these trees, and, B, thinking that it's trees versus affordable housing."
03_30_2016,affordable housing,"And I thought, we thought it was a little bit...  more onerous and expensive for developers of affordable housing, and it could result in them not being able to build the affordable housing that is so necessary. I mean, we're very glib about saying nobody favors tradeoffs, but, you know, reality requires some tradeoffs. And right now we lack 34,000 units of affordable housing in this city, and so –  I'm trying to make sure, I'm trying to strike a compromise here that will allow affordable housing to be constructed without gumming up the work so much that people throw up their hands and say, forget it."
03_30_2016,affordable housing,"How many affordable housing units are we expecting on single-family lots? This applies to multifamily as well, but I don't have that number. This isn't just single-family lots."
03_30_2016,affordable housing,"I don't know. It sounds quite complicated. I do want to say that I have some real concerns about exempting  affordable housing from the tree code of requirements for many of the same reasons that [ORGANIZATION] and a couple of the people on the committee, I think it was [PERSON], mentioned an equity issue."
03_30_2016,affordable housing,Many of the affordable housing units are being built in and near low-income neighborhoods. Yes. these neighborhoods have fewer trees to start with.
03_30_2016,affordable housing,"I have some real problems with a number of those things, but the exemption of public property or public bureaus, the exemption of the affordable housing, the exemption of the site. I don't like seeing the exemption of all the [STREET] right-of-ways as a flat-out exemption. I think there are a lot of cases where sidewalks can be designed in different ways."
03_28_2018,homeless,"We've been able to serve 54% people of color in [ORGANIZATION]. Eighty-nine percent of the folks we've served are very low income, between zero and 30% of median family income, and 22% self-report that they're homeless at entry. So we're very relevant to the issues of [PERSON]."
03_28_2018,homeless,"I spent DATE0 in addiction. I was homeless for [PERSON] of that. And so when I came out of jail last time, I was introduced to [ORGANIZATION] through the ORG1 program."
03_28_2018,homeless,"I do think positively of memories of occupied [ORGANIZATION], which is a park out here. They did try to feed people. They tried to get outreach for homeless people."
03_28_2018,affordable housing,"To support [ORGANIZATION]. Colleagues, in [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] directed [PERSON] and ORG2 to develop an equitable housing strategy to address potential displacement and housing choices in anticipation of a proposed light rail line along the [ORGANIZATION]. Significant planning and community outreach has been done, and a draft equitable housing strategy is now available online at [ORGANIZATION] slash bps slash [DATE]."
03_28_2018,affordable housing,"I don't expect anybody to remember that, but it's on the city website, which is being supplemented with a feasibility analysis of potential sites. [ORGANIZATION] has a successful history of providing a variety of technical assistance to affordable housing developers and owners, and it's already under contract with [ORGANIZATION] to perform this exact kind of work. ORG2 has both the expertise and the capacity to perform needs assessments and financial analysis."
03_28_2018,affordable housing,"Colleagues, any further questions? So you're actually looking at real physical locations for potential housing, affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]? These are potential sites, prototypes."
03_28_2018,affordable housing,"Please call the roll. PERSON0. Well, a recent study that was done at [ORGANIZATION] showed that there's a lot of naturally occurring affordable housing along the southwest corridor."
04_11_2018,homeless,"Thank you, sir. So I will respond. First of all, we invest heavily, and as I will say in my speech [ORGANIZATION], record amounts in homeless prevention."
04_11_2018,affordable housing,"We made record investments [ORGANIZATION] in housing, and lower-income housing I will –  say [PERSON], and I will show the facts on the screen behind me, we actually delivered record affordable housing [ORGANIZATION], and we're on track DATE2 to do it again. With regard to suites specifically, it is a very rare circumstance during my administration where we actually move somebody out of a campsite. We have a priority list based on either housing  environmental issues, public health issues, or public safety issues."
04_11_2018,homeless,"The whole village got swept. There are 60,000 homeless people in [ORGANIZATION], and they're investing a billion and a half. I didn't say the problem's solved."
04_11_2018,homelessness,"The reality is with more housing comes more cars and a need for more room for cars which includes off [STREET] parking to store them when not in use. Without more places for cars, more conflicts will occur and more people will be hurt. One of the failures of the political oratory and agenda is not initiating a discussion connecting population growth with homelessness, poverty, climate change, sustainability and yes, congestion and [ORGANIZATION]  For everybody's health and safety, a continuing conversation needs to take a [STREET] about how to start managing population growth, preferably with the public voluntarily accepting smaller families."
04_11_2018,affordable housing,"Eleven have been in my district, and three of those were on FAC0. One of the recent deaths on this section of the [STREET]...  was of a woman who was trying to cross safely in a designated crosswalk but was struck by a vehicle. As residents have been pushed east in an effort to find more affordable housing, many folks are transit-dependent, and even though this area and our infrastructure is much more accessible by car,  As you travel further east, our arterials change to four lanes, marked crosswalks become less frequent, and many residents walk along roadways to access transit, work, and school."
04_11_2018,housing crisis,"We were able to immediately file a request for a hearing, get back into [STREET], and negotiate a new agreement that allowed the tenant to stay in their housing and obtain the vital treatment they needed in order to maintain their sobriety. Finally, I would be remiss if I did not underline how the housing crisis [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION] is the most pressing fair housing issue that we face. Through numerous cases that [ORGANIZATION] has handled representing large number of tenants in building-wide displacements or exorbitant rent increases, we have seen how the housing crisis is resulting in the wholesale displacement of communities of color."
04_11_2018,housing crisis,"Through these cases, we have also seen how the housing crisis is reinforcing familiar patterns of housing segregation. In addition, landlords are utilizing more stringent screening criteria that make it nearly impossible for communities of color and individuals with disabilities to live anywhere in our city. This is an area ripe for disparate impact litigation."
04_11_2018,housing crisis,The obligation of the Fair Housing Act command that equity and fair housing be the center of any analysis of policy initiatives aimed at addressing the housing crisis. We owe this to every member of our protected classes in our city. Thank you.
04_11_2018,affordable housing,"These tenants often struggle to find and keep affordable housing. facing housing discrimination against families and recent immigrants. My colleague at [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], will be sharing a story from her community."
04_11_2018,homelessness,"Programs require their participants to meet the federal definition of homelessness, thus bearing Native community members to do communal culture where community members may be doubled up with friends or family. Indeed, it has been observed that information management database reports show that the community-wide effort to fight homelessness simply does not know much about the Native American community. Assessment tools give a profound lack of regard for any community member's specific tribe, and [ORGANIZATION] has grouped the community together as all Native American, American Indian, and [PERSON]."
04_11_2018,homeless,"And now she can be able to prosper. And with a person with mental health and physical health disabilities plus background limitations, that if it wasn't for [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], we would be homeless right now. So I want to thank [ORGANIZATION] and ORG2, and I didn't even know that you guys had a fair housing 50th anniversary, and I'm glad to be here."
04_11_2018,affordable housing,"This bonus offers additional floor area and height for projects that provide affordable commercial space, and [ORGANIZATION] is working on administrative rules and will be the administrator of this bonus. And what we're doing here is amending a section of the zoning code to clarify for implementation how the affordable commercial bonus would work vis-a-vis the inclusionary housing bonus, which is also in the code, so that there's some clarity about what types of projects would access bonuses through which [STREET]. And the proposal is that in the code of 100 projects that were 100% residential projects  but weren't triggering [ORGANIZATION] because they're not hitting that 20 units threshold, would go to the inclusionary housing program and either build housing units or make a contribution to the affordable housing fund in order to gain additional FAR."
04_11_2018,affordable housing,"So if a project wanted to utilize the full floor area allowed on the site, they would have to actually use affordable commercial and affordable housing opportunity to get there. And then finally, for mixed-use projects, so these projects would include residential and commercial, that would like to gain bonus floor area, they can do so by either providing voluntary affordable housing units on-site, by building on-site affordable commercial space, or by first making a payment to [ORGANIZATION] up to the maximum limit that they can, which again is half of the maximum, and then turning to the housing fund for the rest of that. The other clarification here is that we're clarifying in the code that the affordable commercial space bonus, as it's structured right now, if you build space on site, the return is two square feet of bonus floor area for every one square foot of space provided."
04_11_2018,affordable housing,"There's a slight incentive to provide it on site, much like the housing is structured to provide an incentive to do it on site. But clarifying that if you're purchasing floor area via the –  affordable commercial space fund, the ratio is one square foot per the dollar figure. And those figures are preliminarily set to be the same as the affordable housing figures administered by [ORGANIZATION]."
04_11_2018,affordable housing,"And the one that...  called out to me, some [ORGANIZATION] members were uncomfortable with the idea of making fee in lieu payments available as an option for voluntary programs to boost floor area ratio. They questioned why funds raised in this matter based on in lieu payment would be sole source to a particular city bureau when there might be alternative uses for such funds that would more directly mitigate impacts of the allowed floor area ratio, for instance parking management programs, [STREET] trees or whatever. It just kind of called out to me that for the inclusionary housing, we have ORG1 that has an affordable housing bond that is in charge of looking at how do we do affordable housing."
04_11_2018,affordable housing,"And so it's clear for that that the [ORGANIZATION] is going to then benefit affordable housing. For this commercial program, we don't have a mechanism currently for [ORGANIZATION] to find other alternative spaces. Okay."
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"Right. And for those watching at home who may not have access to, well, who don't have access to this document, the three that are not being proposed to be adopted on consent are a set of action items for affordable housing, specifying pretty much our current policy, one to the  remove [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] from the interagency team proposed to provide coordinated environmental permit reviews streamlining, and then also to delete an action item from this [ORGANIZATION] section because it's the same as one in the [PERSON] section. All right."
03_05_2015,affordable housing,Thank you for that warning. You can put a little piece of tape over the –  So the language there crosses out the words or provision of greenway enhancements. But is that because we're not any longer going to consider greenway enhancements or because they're otherwise covered?  Because I thought the discussion that we had last time was talking about affordable housing as the main reason for doing bonuses and [ORGANIZATION] historic resources a secondary one to me the [ORGANIZATION] issues are not related should not be related to the height bonuses
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"The new item A is directing us to come back to you all with a sort of a economically tested and redesigned bonus system that puts priority on affordable housing,  historic preservation and public open space. And seismic. And seismic."
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"I mean, if we want to focus on affordable housing and preservation and seismic, aren't we –  Is this amendment? Yeah, we're going to. No, no, it's actually, we're bringing back the results of the analysis in [ORGANIZATION]."
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"And also part of that is when we come back for the entire central city plan, I think what we want to be able to do is put the three or four –  a key potential bonus, and have you had that real discussion about which one is most important that you really want to focus on? Do you want to just have that? Do you want to have a point system like some cities have where if affordable housing is the most important?  It gets more points, per se, than the FAC0 or something else."
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"The height should be for something that benefits that particular property, not that particular area. And it should be for affordable housing or historic preservation. And that's it."
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"But it also could be the affordable housing bonus, and we'll bring that package back that you can consider it. But what [ORGANIZATION] and our stakeholders were interested in is finding a [STREET] –  a [STREET] to preserve the smaller buildings that are part of the character of the FAC0. And so the commissioner in [ORGANIZATION], Commissioner [PERSON]'s proposed amendment, is consistent with that point of view."
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"How does removing the residential requirement comply with our current comprehensive plan policy of no net loss of housing? Well, there's two no net loss of housing policies. One is the affordable housing no net loss, and that's not the one you're referring to."
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"It's the citywide no net loss of housing policy. In the proposed comprehensive plan, we are not continuing that policy because the  Not the affordable housing no net loss. There's a mandate that you can't change zoning out in the neighborhoods from one zone to another It comp the no net loss of housing policy that I believe you're referring to commissioner is a Man it comes from Metro  It doesn't count our mixed-use zone as a legitimate [STREET] to provide residential development."
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"Not, it doesn't deal with the abstract notion about where we may be developing housing in the future. It's the existing inventory of affordable housing. So we need to – I wasn't aware that we were going to be doing away with current comprehensive plan policies in this particular part of the process."
03_05_2015,affordable housing,so this just clarifies that so we're fully supportive of this action uh if [ORGANIZATION] would like to uh discuss it that would be fine if it's consent okay well i guess uh i guess i don't recall publicly open or publicly accessible open space being one of the things that we were discussing in the spirit of narrowing the focus of our bonuses i mean i think affordable housing seismic and historic preservation were what i had in mind okay
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"It sounds like you're saying this is something you want to assess as to whether it's a viable bonus. But I think you're likely to hear from us that we want to,  narrow the range of bonus linkages and give higher priority to affordable housing. So are we talking –  Is there any daylight between us or can you direct us out?"
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"Yes, so they're both before us. Okay. I strongly support Commissioner [PERSON]'s amendment for zoning tools to allow height increases other than on the waterfront, only for preservation of historic properties and affordable housing."
03_05_2015,affordable housing,I'm very concerned about the height limits. bonus provisions and bonus transfer system supported by the current draft plan in many respects i think many of these problems continue especially as it relates to FAC0 particularly the 25 to 25 about 25 block area east of FAC1 and a few blocks immediately west of the stadium which were talked about earlier today friends of FAC0 strongly supports commissioner amendments  commissioner [ORGANIZATION]'s amendments [DATE] and 43 removing height bonuses over certain historic neighboring areas in the [ORGANIZATION] only allowing height increases above existing levels for historic preservation and affordable housing so we agree with this
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"but we'd like to see a similar amendment for goose hollow which does not currently exist in the draft  [ORGANIZATION] supported the removal of height bonuses in [ORGANIZATION], consistent with 80% of the ORG1 members at the [ORGANIZATION] meeting, special meeting. We voted for height bonuses to be removed in [ORGANIZATION]. If the council decides not to remove all height bonuses, [ORGANIZATION] requests ORG2 to at least allow height increase bonuses only for historic preservation and for affordable housing."
03_05_2015,affordable housing,So I just want you to consider if there's a [STREET] to deal with that issue because we did not come before you last time and say we want [ORGANIZATION] with no residential. On [DATE].  I wholeheartedly support Commissioner [PERSON]'s call for removing bonuses from [ORGANIZATION] and lowering height limits to 100 or keeping height limits at 100 and only allowing height increases for historic preservation transfers and affordable housing. These are great ideas and creative ways to preserve our incredible historic architecture.
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"I was disappointed to see no similar protection of historic buildings in [ORGANIZATION] or [PERSON]. My personal opinion is to support removing bonuses in [ORGANIZATION], as the [ORGANIZATION] membership vote of 80% wanted bonuses removed. However, if bonuses are not removed, then it seems like a smart idea to allow height increases only through historic preservation and affordable housing bonuses."
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"I'm on the board of [ORGANIZATION], but I'm only speaking for myself [ORGANIZATION]. I want to thank Commissioner [PERSON] for her suggestion in Amendments 42 and [DATE] that the ORG1 receive increased heights only for historic preservation and affordable housing, and bonuses are removed in some areas. I support removing [ORGANIZATION] bonuses, just like 80% of the voters in [ORGANIZATION]."
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"39, preserving step down to the [ORGANIZATION] and to the extent that you're removing bonuses only for preservation and affordable housing is outstanding, and we're very supportive of that. to the extent that this proposal seems to increase the height limit in the historic district. I'm looking at the map at the very end of this long sheet here."
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"I'm a member of [ORGANIZATION] of [ORGANIZATION]. Amendment 43 for the ORG2,  would only allow height increases for historic preservation and affordable housing. I support that for them because we would want that at least for [ORGANIZATION]."
03_05_2015,affordable housing,So I guess that's been resolved in the historic area. But some concerns about the bonus linkage. And could you again walk us through why we want to have the bonus linked to something more than preservation of affordable housing?
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"I called it [ORGANIZATION], LOC1LOC2[PERSON] is apt as well. And the notion there is greater heights –  but only accessible through benefit to historic or smaller properties in the [PERSON] to preserve those. [ORGANIZATION] has also made it clear by Action A in the new list that the provision of affordable housing needs to be considered in that whole package, and we're going to bring that whole package back."
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"PERSON0? Well, I particularly appreciate the work that's been conducted by [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and I think virtually all of the offices around here about the importance of narrowing our bonuses down to, you know, if I had my drugs it would be simply affordable housing, but I understand affordable housing, historic preservation,  uh are also very important seismic issues as well but we really need to take the bold steps"
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"A skyline defines a city, and there's nothing to be ashamed about a skyline. And secondly, it is because I want to see that height result in additional affordable housing, affordable to people, and people can live and work in our downtown. So these are issues why I come to the support of these amendments, or I should say maybe in opposition to some of the amendments that were put forward."
03_05_2015,affordable housing,And the proposed amendment would scratch the FAC0 piece and also limit the transfer eligible things to consider to be preservation or affordable housing. I apologize. I was confused.
03_05_2015,affordable housing,We recommend development of zoning tools that would allow increased height in exchange for greenway enhancements along the waterfront. We just want to explore it. the principle that commissioner [ORGANIZATION] has put out there is that bonus or no bonus it's not a step down to the river and it's not acceptable that's sort of your argument if we are to include it we'd still like to consider the greenway enhancements as one of the ways to get there and also acknowledge that when we bring that whole package back to you it may not be a [STREET] to get to the additional you may want to just use all that for affordable housing or some other purpose but we would still  planning to explore the economics of it.
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"So an enhanced greenway, if it's a more shaded greenway with massive buildings over it, really isn't a good trade. And speaking to Commissioner [PERSON]'s point, we should be really focusing on affordable housing as the main reason to have the bonus. That was a brilliant suggestion that you came up with."
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"This is – you know, the reason I didn't support the request of [ORGANIZATION] and others and [PERSON] to lower the heights  is because I think people have a reasonable expectation when they buy a property that the zoning is the zoning and the height expectation is the height expectation. This proposal would give additional height. And I think we need to be really clear to the [ORGANIZATION] now, no, we really are talking about historic preservation and affordable housing."
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"The other bonus is, you know, the FAC0, I've still got to figure out how we're going to fund that, but it's not a good trade to have a much taller building next to the FAC0 in order to have a nicer FAC0. so i'll just i'll just chime in i i support the increased height uh again for what i said earlier i want to get the affordable housing um i'm skeptical about the greenway bonus too"
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"but i'm deferring to [ORGANIZATION] and in saying you know give us a chance to at least look at it and and i know that study is underway right now so that's kind of why i'm i would oppose the amendment so what did the the action item as is doesn't have affordable housing in it  If I could offer, there's two decision points, and actually there's really just one."
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"And then two, what bonus would you even consider for an increase like that? And what we have heard clearly, and you actually adopted in that additional amendment about the bonus system, is that it goes affordable housing, historic, seismic, open space, and we're going to come back with you all and talk about all those. This FAC0 tradeoff in my book is sitting there in the open space bundle of that policy that you adopted to tell us how to redesign the bonus system."
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"No, I mean, I think if there's bonus there [ORGANIZATION], we can look at reprogramming the [STREET] that you get an existing bonus provision. We don't have to do this to get the affordable housing bonus. No, it's an additional tool."
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"And to add affordable housing? Yeah. It does add affordable housing in this particular reference, which we're supportive of."
03_05_2015,affordable housing,So you think A has captured the affordable housing issue because it says so? I think A tells us what to do with the bonus system. All right.  all right now i understand so that's why now you would oppose this amendment
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"I also want to thank [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], the...  ORG2 members and people on my staff who labored through these documents and I know that we will be coming back in [ORGANIZATION] with the study about the affordable housing bonuses and I look forward to a good discussion and hopefully Aggressive movement on that and I feel I feel good that we're going to get those affordable housing bonuses in [STREET] in time"
05_11_2016,affordable housing,"I'm PERSON0. And first of all, I just want to start with another item. I believe the Mayor and the [ORGANIZATION] members have received testimony on [ORGANIZATION] and the need to have ORG2 follow through with their signed commitment to create housing for 300 affordable housing units."
05_11_2016,affordable housing,"Cascadia High Speed Rail Concept Plan relieves bottlenecks on all these corridors, on FAC0, FAC1, and FAC2. Connected TODs with park and kiss-and-rides could be very effective in relieving a [STREET] for affordable housing and market rate housing. [TIME] to FAC3 from [ORGANIZATION]."
05_11_2016,homeless,"Yes. Sometimes I get a little bit confused what people are talking about. With paramedics mixed with homeless people and 911 calls and a social worker, sometimes I feel that it's assumed that homeless people are mentally ill and they need to be taken to a doctor."
05_11_2016,homeless,"I'm just sick, okay? I'm not a homeless, mentally ill person, but I was so incapacitated. It was, the virus was going around [ORGANIZATION]."
05_11_2016,homeless,"I'm making a point. Watch out what you're doing here, assuming that all people who look homeless or are throwing up or on the sidewalk could be sick. Good point."
05_11_2016,affordable housing,"So we'll do an overview of the budget. [ORGANIZATION] covered some of the highest points on that. And then we'll walk through the actual, the budget itself, starting from the overall budget, different, both on the  Remind everybody where we are on the affordable housing set-aside, and then get into the specific urban renewal area budgets."
05_11_2016,affordable housing,"So we have –  $300 million really left to spend on the set-aside. The different categories are we have three closed-out districts, districts that are no longer issuing debt payments,  When debt was issued there, there was money set aside for affordable housing. That money sits in our budget."
05_11_2016,affordable housing,"So you see that's about $20 million. And then the remainder, about $284 million, is money that will flow into affordable housing from either existing resources or new debt in those districts. Okay."
05_11_2016,affordable housing,"You can see how the amended set-aside policy played out. The percentages are very different across different urban renewal areas, with interstate having a significant, basically, the bulk of the dollars that remain in the interstate district will be going into affordable housing, so 70%. And FAC0 had a significant increase, as did [ORGANIZATION], and then the rest fall pretty close to that 30% number that we've used for [ORGANIZATION]."
05_11_2016,affordable housing,"Well, they did do two other things, which would be unlikely that we'd ever do here. One is that as they master planned the area around FAC0, they created a favorable plan for development and mandated no affordable housing. So you've got just this –  huge area of high-end condos with no vision for affordable housing integrated in."
05_11_2016,affordable housing,"So as you said, I'm here to testify on behalf of [ORGANIZATION], which is made up of a diverse group of stakeholders from the [ORGANIZATION] URAs. This is [ORGANIZATION] serving on the committee, and I just wanted to say that I was really pleased [ORGANIZATION] to see that the recommendations we made DATE2 were taken to heart by [ORGANIZATION]. And particularly as somebody who cares very much about affordable housing, I've been happy to see the increased coordination and cooperation between [ORGANIZATION] and ORG2."
05_11_2016,affordable housing,"We're going to quickly run, we're going to finish up with FAC0 and then go through the neighborhood ones, and then we'll bring [ORGANIZATION] will come up and offer the neighborhood committee perspective. So FAC0, the bulk of our dollars DATE0 going into the parcel three affordable housing development, so that obviously came out of the conversation DATE1 around the set-aside. So we would, I think that's pretty much."
05_11_2016,affordable housing,"Okay. So now I'll move to adopt [ORGANIZATION]. PERSON0, would you please read the description?"
05_11_2016,affordable housing,"Now I'll move on to number 34, and I'll move to adopt the affordable housing and anti-displacement policy amendments list. Is there a second? Second."
05_11_2016,affordable housing,"Yeah, and we could also, Commissioner, talk about what we're going to give you this additional economic benefit. What are we going to get for that? We had talked about height bonuses in some instances going for affordable housing."
05_11_2016,affordable housing,"The home forward property is currently developed at a lower density than FAC0, and the current FAC1 designation kind of prevents redevelopment of that site for additional affordable housing units. Mm-hmm. So [ORGANIZATION] requested the change?"
05_11_2016,affordable housing,"The proposal generated quite a bit of debate in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood and some division from different folks. Okay.  some property owner opposition from some of the affected property owners, and  The revision to that expressed in the Mayor's memo was to scale it back to a smaller number of properties that the property on the left is owned by an affordable housing provider, and the other properties on the right-hand side are essentially the properties and the other vacant sites associated with the original request. So, it's a scaled back version of the initial proposal in recognition that there was quite a bit of opposition to the original proposal."
05_11_2016,affordable housing,"The one on the left side of the right currently has an affordable housing project on it. The ones on the right hand side of the right picture are vacant. On the left side here where my [LOCATION] is, that would allow if the owner, which is an affordable housing provider, wanted to increase density and build a larger project there, they could."
04_12_2017,homeless,"When she gets here, we'll accommodate her. First item, please. Item 341, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood seek a permanent solution to the homeless camp on Broadway Jonesmoor."
04_12_2017,homelessness,"Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding the city housing shortage, crime, drugs, and homelessness issues. Mr. [PERSON], good morning. Thank you."
04_12_2017,homeless; homelessness; affordable housing; housing insecurity,"but we can't leave the building my employees  have a hard time going to lunch, running errands, going for a run during lunch because there's so much drug problem around our area and so much homelessness. And I think that [ORGANIZATION] needs to consider how to have more beds, more shelters, shelters for families, shelters for families with pets. prioritize funding for mental health services for drug and alcohol addiction we need more secure permanent affordable housing for those who are homeless or have housing insecurity we need to support families that are in homes or in apartments help them pay their rent keep them from slipping into homelessness it's simply not good enough that we say we don't have the money  The cost to [ORGANIZATION] and the damage to [ORGANIZATION] in terms of livability and the resulting loss of businesses far exceeds what we would spend to take care of these problems."
04_12_2017,homeless,"And we need to address them, and I know that the council is very concerned about that. Mayor [PERSON] has outlined his plans for those issues, and we support those. With [ORGANIZATION] and [LOCATION] coming,  We tend to, I think, become more complacent because the homeless aren't out in the cold."
04_12_2017,homelessness,"It's warmer, but we need to address these issues now. And we need to support the mayor and the issues of homelessness and drug addiction in our city because it affects the businesses in our city. It affects our desire to stay here and in the end that affects [ORGANIZATION]'s livability overall."
04_12_2017,housing crisis,"347, proclaim [ORGANIZATION] to be fair housing [LOCATION] in [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] is in a rental housing crisis. However, this crisis has always been present for people of low income and communities of color, recent immigrants and refugees."
04_12_2017,homelessness,So this is a very real and very current issue in our community. This proclamation demonstrates our belief that hate has no [STREET] in housing or in our city. We know the most effective [STREET] to stabilize households and prevent homelessness is to keep people in the housing that they already have.
04_12_2017,homeless,"When harassment is not addressed, particularly in this housing environment, there's a cost to the community. An eviction could easily make a low income household homeless or displaced from their community. If for example you're a large family or disabled, the time to be rehoused is much greater and the cost on the city is much greater."
04_12_2017,affordable housing,"Finding affordable housing for families is essential for younger generations to access opportunity, as seen with the efforts to keep families in their apartments in both the FAC0 and FAC1 school communities DATE0. Also, as the leader in [ORGANIZATION] leading the commission to redraw school boundaries because of both enrollment shifts due to growth and gentrification, we need a regional effort to plan for change that is both equitable and sustainable. Knowing this, there are policies we can pursue to resolve these issues."
04_12_2017,housing crisis,"Four, [ORGANIZATION] can significantly increase enforcement tools to expand access to housing choice for families of all sizes as well as individuals. [ORGANIZATION] can reinvest in media education campaigns to help people identify different kinds of housing discrimination, including subtle acts of discrimination or disparate impacts, and how to address it. These are just some of the ideas that could address our housing crisis, and [ORGANIZATION] Director [PERSON] will soon share his frame for affirmatively furthering fair housing in our area."
04_12_2017,affordable housing,"And each and every day we have moments of inflection. Decisions can be made to put housing in high opportunity areas to make sure that we're compensating for people's lack of access. It does mean that it costs more, and we're oftentimes criticized for the high cost of affordable housing, but we're trying to alleviate and correct some of these pervasive disparate impacts."
04_12_2017,affordable housing,"And I think we should be proud that we are building quality affordable housing and high opportunity areas and making it available to low income families. And finally, I just wanna call out the work of [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]."
04_12_2017,affordable housing,"I represent [ORGANIZATION]. On this situation here,  As you know, we have a bio here. And [ORGANIZATION], for whatever reason, you did not want to have a bio on [ORGANIZATION]."
04_12_2017,homelessness,I met Ms. [PERSON] [TIME]. Our family is looking to help with this and homelessness issues. We're very active in this.
04_12_2017,homelessness,"And I worked for [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] for a number of years during college. There are people in [ORGANIZATION] and surrounding areas around [ORGANIZATION] that want to help you solve this problem. And so what I'm offering to you, and this can fall under homelessness and police oversight."
04_12_2017,homelessness,"I generally support the reappointment. Even though I've known [ORGANIZATION], my issues have largely been in [ORGANIZATION]. But there are people that want to help you solve two issues, homelessness and police oversight is so important because that's something I'm very passionate about."
04_12_2017,homelessness,"There are immense economic pressures put on the housing in the city right now. And it's causing a lot of problems, as you guys are all well aware. Homelessness is on the rise."
04_12_2017,housing crisis,"This development is part of that solution. This development upgrades a vacant lot and a single residence that hasn't been occupied by residents in [ORGANIZATION] to 18 new units, [ADDRESS] in this area can be used to alleviate the housing crisis."
04_12_2017,affordable housing,"Good [TIME]. Good [TIME]. I'm Dr. [PERSON], and usually I'm here talking about affordable housing."
04_12_2017,affordable housing,"It doesn't matter what area it is, but oftentimes it's the term capacity, or it's the term experience, whatever term we want to use, that consistently happens around ethnic developers. And so that's a concern as I consider what's been going on and once approved and not approved. I'd like to see this being, obviously this building built for all of the things that have already been said and things we're considering or want to consider as we move forward around how to do affordable housing well."
05_03_2018,housing crisis,"According to [ORGANIZATION], over a third of hateful acts occur in housing. Feeling safe and secure in our homes is of course fundamental. People who are feeling trapped by hateful acts where they live feel even more vulnerable amid a housing crisis where there are limited opportunities to move."
05_03_2018,homeless,"This has led to an increase...  in calls related to hateful acts on our hotline and requests for more trainings and technical assistance. We are also training housing providers, landlords, homeowner associations, and homeless shelters on their legal responsibilities to prevent and address acts of hate that occur on their properties. In [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] issued a ruling requiring these housing providers to address these situations and not doing so as a violation of federal law."
05_03_2018,affordable housing,"I think a data point on here that I do want to mention is that within the non-cost burdened renters, an important figure is around 7,700 households are actually at 30% [ORGANIZATION] and below. Yeah. And this is the result of both [ORGANIZATION] housing vouchers, both housing choice vouchers and project-based vouchers, as well as the affordable housing system with [ORGANIZATION] financing affordable housing and ORG1 delivering it to the community."
05_03_2018,affordable housing,"DATE0, we brought online 511 new units and preserved 145 units of affordable housing. We are also proud that we were able to increase our deeply affordable units in our production pipeline by 12%. I would like to acknowledge that in this [PERSON]'s report, we have a placeholder for our progress on permanent supportive housing as we're working to develop"
05_03_2018,affordable housing,"In [ORGANIZATION], there are 30 inclusionary housing projects in process with over 180 units of affordable housing in those projects in the pipeline. We have 1,660 total units and 30 projects currently. And in pre-application and early assistance meetings, there are 49 additional projects, including nine in the central city, which would bring on a minimum of 1,200 new units to the city."
05_03_2018,affordable housing,Yes. The affordable housing that you are delivering is at a record high and continues to be projected to be at that level into the foreseeable future. You are adding new programs.
05_03_2018,homelessness,"Good, and I don't even know whether 16% is the right number, but that's the percentage of the total portfolio. And, you know, we hear from people all the time that we should be investing in housing that serves a range of incomes and a range of neighborhoods and the like. And I certainly agree with the sentiment, but when you have limited resources and you know that one particular –  type of housing is urgently needed to address homelessness, we have to make sure that we continue to invest."
05_03_2018,homelessness,"The language is embedded. And I think that's entirely consistent with the guidance that this council gave you, which is we want to aggressively move into bolstering, boosting our supply of permanent supportive housing as perhaps the most effective and certainly cost-effective tool to address homelessness. So thank you for that."
05_03_2018,affordable housing,"Walk me through again that stat that you offered that said a certain portion of those who are not cost burdened are extremely low income and they're not cost burdened because they're... They have affordable, stable, affordable housing. Yes."
05_03_2018,affordable housing,"And the poverty rate in [ORGANIZATION] is now 15.5. So, you know, we talk about affordable housing, the challenge is that income has not kept... ..not only not kept pace, income has actually gone down. I think you'll also find that homeownership rates have fallen as well."
05_03_2018,housing crisis; affordable housing,"Yes, I mean, we could solve the affordable housing crisis with increased incomes as well that would support the rents that are currently in the market. It's not a...  only a housing problem. No, it's a problem of income inequality and, quite frankly, poverty."
05_03_2018,homelessness,I especially appreciate the renewed attention on permanent supportive housing as a key tool in our arsenal to attack [STREET] homelessness. And I look forward to...  working with the [ORGANIZATION] and the Mayor to target the new resources that are in the Mayor's proposed budget to address some of our most urgent needs. And I'm particularly interested in seeing the service dollars that the Mayor is proposing to add be clearly segregated so we can accumulate them and then spend them strategically on the units that we have in the pipeline.
05_20_2020,housing crisis,"We can't let this virus crisis or the ongoing housing crisis tempt us into giving up on our incredibly pressing climate problem. With the will to do it, we can push for reuse of buildings, incentivizing developers to remodel, upgrade, and add on to existing buildings. Raising older buildings results in a big hit on scarce resources."
05_20_2020,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] recently named their flagship affordable housing project after [ORGANIZATION]. The [ORGANIZATION] flowers, [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] flowers lived in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood. The [ORGANIZATION] flowers arrived, [ORGANIZATION] flowers arrived in [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION] and his wife, [ORGANIZATION] arrived in [LOCATION] when she married [ORGANIZATION] Irvin."
05_20_2020,affordable housing,"Pedestrian and bicycle safety investments, including lighting infill, [STREET] redesign, and neighborhood greenways in [ORGANIZATION].  and also innovative programs such as the affordable housing transportation wallet, which reduces the financial barriers to a suite of transportation options for people in public housing and affordable housing. In this [PERSON] reality, we are pivoting this work to be responsive to the needs of our new reality. In [ORGANIZATION], you've heard us announce our [ORGANIZATION], where we support safe reopening of our city and provide new options for [ORGANIZATION]'s transportation future."
05_20_2020,housing crisis,"For example, living in multi-generational housing, experiencing job loss that's resulting in households doubling up, and also their employment as essential workers. A particular note, thinking ahead to how we will respond to the housing crisis and providing assistance and addressing evictions will be critical and I hope that this is a focus consistently from the city. An equitable recovery must effectively serve our small businesses and workers, including those owned by Asian and [LOCATION] communities."
05_20_2020,affordable housing,"And we have four inclusionary housing multiple unit limited tax exemption applications with  with ordinances for approval before you [ORGANIZATION]. So just with some quick background, starting in [LOCATION], any building adding more than 20 new units is required to contribute to the city's affordable housing inventory through [ORGANIZATION]. Projects have several options to fulfill the inclusionary housing requirements."
05_20_2020,affordable housing,"This also avails them to additional exemptions through [ORGANIZATION] as well as [ORGANIZATION]. And looking at the ORG1 specifics, that one has a per year total of $2,815. And over [ORGANIZATION], there's a difference of $27,000 for the whole project compared to a rough difference in the average rent of $3,000."
05_20_2020,houseless,"And I just wonder, are these the kind of adults we want around our youth and our community? And what kind of message are we sending? And finally, transit police are used to target poor people, especially houseless people who cannot afford fare."
05_20_2020,houseless,"We need to redirect public funds from over-policing to essential services like parks and childcare, hygiene for houseless, housing, representation, and defense of immigrants, and to create our own public utilities such as municipal bank, internet,  power, et cetera, that would all invest in the future and generate revenue and profit for the city to expand public services. Making these changes would help the city and be much more in line with the mission and values of our city. Thank you."
05_20_2020,unhoused,"The transit police are part and parcel of the criminalization of poor and unhoused folks on our transit system. It's admittedly a complicated program, right? [ORGANIZATION] funds large parts of it, but it's housed at [ORGANIZATION]."
05_20_2020,unhoused,"All our systemic failures are on display, and I have been really impressed how everyone has been hustling to try to address the glaring needs in our community. And I would assert that that is how we should function during normal times as well, because as we know,  There is always a crisis for people in our community who are unhoused, who are being underserved, who are being discriminated against in our community. So this is a painful but necessary exercise in how to prioritize the most vulnerable and least well-served people in our community."
04_19_2017,affordable housing,"Thank you, and let's get started with council communications. [ORGANIZATION], please call the first item. Item 365, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding traffic control and affordable housing."
04_19_2017,homeless,"So I think that as a city that talks some high aspirations, when we have the Rose Festival coming in [ORGANIZATION], even though we think we've housed all of our homeless veterans, it's a great chance for us to review how well we are serving people who have –  gotten into that boondoggle of serve your country and then either die or get out and don't have your country serve you. So it's okay to have little parties and stuff where we try and find equitable goodness. When there's just been goodness that benefited white men, we don't really need to have a party about that."
04_19_2017,homeless,"So let us duel in truths known to the downtrodden, not the rich, in truths met on the streets atop sewer gutters where steam is the only warmth for a truth so cold it killed six or seven or 100 DATE0 in our little hamlet of lily-white dreams for white homeowners angered by homeless people bothering them for change. I challenge you, Mayor, to a duel of truth. Will you meet me in the streets?"
04_19_2017,housing crisis; houseless,I thought we were having a housing crisis. I thought we were in the middle of a crisis where we had no [STREET] to even house the houseless. And here we've got the police asking for more stuff.
04_19_2017,houseless,"So I want everybody to know that murderers. Racists. Clowns.  clan leaders, rapists, liars, criminals, and thugs that you sanction on the streets to unleash their fury on people of color, trans people, houseless people, and  protesters exercising their rights."
04_19_2017,housing crisis,"Third, I believe that this is state terrorism, and it's going to create a culture of fear in our community that a house that's for sale, an apartment unit that's up for lease, could very well be inhabited by infiltrators from law enforcement. Kind of reminds me of that Twilight Zone episode, [ORGANIZATION] Maple [STREET], where a community is divided in half due to a lack of trust. That you're doing this during a housing crisis is straight up immoral."
04_19_2017,homeless,"And if they go for the cheese first, I'll know where they're coming from. DATE0 in, Mr. [PERSON], you're no humanitarian. You stole your campaign platforms from the best of your competitors, including PERSON1, talking about police reform and  [PERSON] about the homeless you're showing us that you don't care and if you won't resign then maybe we should look into a recall vote That's all."
04_19_2017,affordable housing,"And here are the seven current volunteers serving on the commission. [ORGANIZATION], project manager for [ORGANIZATION], focusing on affordable housing projects. Architect principal, PERSON1 with [ORGANIZATION]."
04_19_2017,affordable housing,"And then the next project type, affordable housing. Out of those 33 mixed-use housing projects, five included affordable units. And of the 4,000-plus units that are in those projects, 482 were affordable units."
04_19_2017,affordable housing,"Okay.  or approximately 12% of our new apartments or living units were affordable housing units. Two of those are... Well, let me start by saying the one in the middle is actually partly a design commission result of FAC0 behind it, which was identified as a public benefit associated with that project."
04_19_2017,affordable housing,"So the second phase of the [ORGANIZATION] project actually includes affordable housing units that were part of that public benefit to give them more FAR in height. And so, which brings us to the design guidelines. And when we kind of saw the variety of architecture that's been proposed, that's a result of the design guidelines, which are intended to be flexible in how they're met."
04_19_2017,affordable housing,"FAC0 is an example I cited [TIME], in which additional affordable housing units were part of the deal, along with...  funding for the study and improvement of the parks blocks that immediately east of that second phase project. And we also authored the best practices document, which has been retitled a guide to the city's [ORGANIZATION] design review process, which outlines many aspects of the process that gives insight into applicants on how to better, more easily get through  the design review process and expectations of design commission of the design commission relative to, uh, different topics. And we can go into that in a little more detail if you'd like, but basically it gives them the current views and expectations of design commission."
04_19_2017,affordable housing,"It neither needed nor requested special consideration from the city or the design commission during the review process, instead relying on the experience and creative talents of their project team.  which included co-developers [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, and [ORGANIZATION]. Secondly, [LOCATION] is an affordable housing project located in [ORGANIZATION], which we all know is expensive real estate, addressing our city's urgent need to house our most vulnerable citizens. [LOCATION] represents itself as a confident addition to the [PERSON], offering a dignified home for its residents."
04_19_2017,affordable housing,"And finally, [ORGANIZATION] incorporates an emerging sustainable construction technology, [ORGANIZATION], or cross-laminated timber construction, made from a renewable resource and one of [ORGANIZATION]'s most abundant resources, which is trees, and specifically [PERSON] fir. When completed, [ORGANIZATION] will be the tallest wood building in [ORGANIZATION] constructed with [ORGANIZATION] technology, which will be manufactured in [ORGANIZATION], a watershed movement for our state's timber industry and its evolution into a [ORGANIZATION] industry. For these reasons, exceptional design, specifically raising the level of design for affordable housing, and innovation with potential far-reaching impacts to [ORGANIZATION]'s economy, [ORGANIZATION] is pleased to present its first-ever Design Excellence Award to [ORGANIZATION]."
04_19_2017,affordable housing,"And so once that's implemented, that will start to, I think, really gain traction in the outer areas, the outer neighborhoods. Thank you. So we get some criticism from time to time about the quality of affordable housing in parts of the state."
04_19_2017,affordable housing,"And generally, in my experience, it's private sector housing, like in [ORGANIZATION], that was designed to last [ORGANIZATION] without any sense of how it integrates with the neighborhood. And by contrast, we get virtually no pushback from some of the beautifully designed affordable housing stuff that's going in now in FAC0 and FAC1 and everything. There might be a debate about who we're serving and location, but the design is an enhancement."
04_19_2017,affordable housing,So I think we all agree that you can have deeply affordable housing that's beautifully designed and you can meet both goals. Okay. I'm struck that you've given your first award to an affordable housing development that [ORGANIZATION] has been a party to.
04_19_2017,affordable housing,"You're giving an award to a project that shows that you can continue to have high-quality design and deeply affordable. But since there's a tension and we're being told to get more affordable housing out the door, we have to cut red tape, and design review is an area where there's been efforts to –  either bypass you or streamline. Sure."
04_19_2017,affordable housing,"What is the state of that question? Well, I would, yes, obviously that's an affordable housing project, and that makes it even more remarkable. I will say that that project would have gotten through on the first hearing if it weren't for an issue with [ORGANIZATION]."
04_19_2017,affordable housing,"So those are some of the things that we've been kind of kicking around. Well, I'll just say, speaking for myself, when I take visitors into [ORGANIZATION], And I asked, which has one of the highest concentration of deeply affordable housing in the city."
04_19_2017,affordable housing,"And I asked them to identify the affordable housing. Right. More often than not, they can't."
04_19_2017,affordable housing,That we believe good design and affordable housing can go hand in hand. And we shouldn't sacrifice the one for the other. Agreed.
04_19_2017,affordable housing,"I love the fact that you've chosen an affordable housing project with your first Design Excellence Award. And I especially love it because while [ORGANIZATION] is one of the partners on this project, [ORGANIZATION],  [ORGANIZATION], then called ORG2, was thinking about a signature building in the same district and at that time was toying with the idea of partnering with [ORGANIZATION], which I thought in concept was an okay idea, but it turned out it would have been the most expensive affordable housing development in the history of the world and would not have been good for [ORGANIZATION]'s brand to do that. And so I think it's especially wonderful."
04_19_2017,affordable housing,"Thank you.  that you're honoring a building that is using innovative technology, keeping the costs down, and delivering a beautiful and cost-effective building without the glamour of some international architect. Not to say anything, a wonderful architect firm, but I thought the [ORGANIZATION] thing was a bit too much on the vanity side myself. And so the fact that it's affordable and beautiful is really wonderful, and I hope that sets the standard for other people doing affordable housing, because in my view...  Our value system should be very simple."
03_11_2020,homeless,"A hospital psychiatrist came out, agreed with the police surgeon, took him back in for care. A report from [ORGANIZATION] showed that in [ORGANIZATION], 142 arrests at the request of hospital security staff for unwanted. 72% of people deemed unwanted or homeless, 35% of the 142 arrested were people of color."
03_11_2020,homeless,"Good morning. I'm [PERSON] for the record. I'm here as part of [ORGANIZATION], a growing group of now more than 420 neighbors supporting the transitional tiny home village by [PERSON] and ORG2 on the property of [ORGANIZATION]."
03_11_2020,housing crisis,"[ORGANIZATION] neighbors are far from perfect, and privilege is invisible to those of us who have it. I started doing some basic research and was humbled to find how incredibly disconnected I was at the time to what was happening with the state of wages, housing options, and support, not only in my [ORGANIZATION] community, but in many cities across the [PERSON] I decided then to commit myself to actions and solutions in this space, which is what brings me here [ORGANIZATION]. I believe that many small, well executed community supportive solutions like the transitional tiny home village plan for FAC0 and others are one [STREET] to make a measurable impact in our housing crisis right now."
03_11_2020,homeless,"We are behind [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and appreciate your continued support. We are ready to engage, volunteer, and welcome this village. Thank you."
03_11_2020,homeless,With regard to the homeless population. The homeless population is a highly vulnerable population. Even younger individuals who are homeless are at greater risk of having or contracting [PERSON] because they tend to be a population with coexisting health conditions.
03_11_2020,affordable housing,"I remember [ORGANIZATION] when this discussion happened in [LOCATION], right? And there was consideration as to how to address a $20 million allocation to be set aside for affordable housing. At that time, the director of [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], was considering how they would go about doing this work, and they hired a consultant, and a variety of staff members went to different community-gathered spaces to ask people to get engaged."
03_11_2020,affordable housing,"And we wanted to try to speak with them about why they chose this opportunity, what it meant to them, and what their experiences were as they, in some cases, moved back into the neighborhood or moved into more stable, affordable housing in the neighborhood. And we wanted to try to provide this information to the city, to the oversight committee, and also to help think about what other kinds of programming or resources might be important as part of the strategy moving forward. So we spoke with folks about their experiences and also their ideas about what they might like to see in their buildings and in their communities."
03_11_2020,affordable housing,And we also know that many people need affordable housing. What we found is that 80% of the folks that we surveyed said that their connection to the neighborhood was their primary motivation in applying for this opportunity. So [STREET] was really an important component of their prioritization.
03_11_2020,affordable housing,"I have one request when you do the report [ORGANIZATION]. On page 1, it says it's part of the history and the charge of the Charter. In [LOCATION], Mayor [PERSON], with the support of [ORGANIZATION] Commissioner [PERSON], dedicated an additional $20 million in tax increment financing dollars from [ORGANIZATION] to affordable housing to begin to address the ongoing threat of displacement and gentrification."
03_11_2020,affordable housing,"We are starting to have an impact on a small number of people who have [ORGANIZATION] of lived experience in the city of [ORGANIZATION]. I am giddy about the housing units that [ORGANIZATION] and others are doing that will come online [LOCATION]. Because when people talk to me about affordable housing, that's actually housing people can afford to live in who work for a living in the city of [ORGANIZATION]."
03_11_2020,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION]'s life journey began [ORGANIZATION]. But the roads or the routes of affordable housing are directly related to and aligned with determinants such as health disparities, education, access to information, drug and alcohol abuse, mental wellness, income disparities, unemployment disparities. And of course, what we're talking about [LOCATION], home ownership disparities that for us began DATE2."
03_11_2020,affordable housing,"Redlining access to affordable housing, housing mortgages and loans, and laws and policies that landlords and leasing agents use to discriminate against people of color. While these families were forced to rent, 64% of the time, people of color were cited with higher rents, higher deposits, and additional fees. And it's affected all of those neighborhoods that we're talking about [ORGANIZATION]."
03_11_2020,affordable housing,"Somewhere between FAC0 and my mom's move to [ORGANIZATION] is when my application for displaced families was submitted. DATE0, several lotteries, several screenings. My name was selected through [ORGANIZATION] and I was selected for by ORG1 in collaboration with ORG2."
03_11_2020,affordable housing,"Fast forward to [ORGANIZATION]. And my dad is still guiding my living process, but me and my brother, my niece and my nephew are in the process of purchasing affordable housing by [LOCATION]. Through the efforts of [ORGANIZATION], being a young parent and raising a disabled child could never be easy for any community member."
03_11_2020,affordable housing; houseless,"Previous preference in affordable housing programs, excuse me, Previous preference in affordable housing programs have cared for more people than expected, reduced houseless families more than expected, saved more medical and mental health costs than expected, and saved more lives than we ever could imagine. As we heard [ORGANIZATION], according to the [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], nearly 10,000 families were displaced. These families simply cannot grow a community if you scatter them to the wind."
03_11_2020,affordable housing,And so the sweat equity models and the shared equity models provide for families support and help each other and bring cultural diversity back to the community. By enacting the preference policies and affordable housing programs with the 50-20 condo project will help marginalized families with historical roots in north and northeast [ORGANIZATION] come back or stay. and putting them in affordable housing units or affordable home ownerships.
03_11_2020,homeless,"I show up here and even though this [STREET] is a country club, you know, I'm saying homeless people are part of the community. I just can't imagine why anybody would call this [STREET] a country club. I have much higher standards for country clubs than city council, right?"
05_02_2018,homeless,"And just knowing a lot of people in this room [ORGANIZATION], I know it's important to all of you as well. And it has become clear to many of us through the efforts we're engaged in, and I realize the proclamation is broad in its approach, but as I think about the services that the city delivers, both our first responders and our police bureau and our fire bureau, And I think about the work that we do around the homeless population on our streets and the many service providers that we interact with."
05_02_2018,homeless,It will. So we're assuming that...  all homeless people have easy access to a telephone? So we have worked with outreach providers to assist and make sure that all the outreach providers working with the population are aware of the process.
05_02_2018,homeless,"Colleagues, I have one amendment that I propose as well. Decrease program expenses in [ORGANIZATION], this is general fund, by $1,250,000 for [ORGANIZATION] and set aside funds for program carryover and allocation in the [ORGANIZATION] budget. These funds were previously approved by the ORG2 for shelter costs in the DATE1 fall supplemental budget, but the resources are not expected to be spent before the close of DATE2."
05_02_2018,homeless,"All right, I want to note that we also have [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] here from [ORGANIZATION]. So if people had specific questions about that. PERSON2, or Director PERSON3, sorry."
05_02_2018,homeless,"Could I get a little more clarity on the amendment that I've put forward for the record? This is for shelter capital costs. and they were not expended during [ORGANIZATION], so we were requesting that they be carried over to [LOCATION], and that has been done in discussion with [ORGANIZATION]."
05_02_2018,homeless,and this was the one with regard to the carryover of the allocation to [ORGANIZATION] please call the roll  [ORGANIZATION]? Aye. PERSON1?
05_02_2018,homeless; housing crisis,Government can't solve the housing crisis by itself. People in [ORGANIZATION] want to help. More than 800 people signed up for a [ORGANIZATION] pilot program to host a homeless family in their backyard in an FAC0 built by the county.
05_02_2018,affordable housing,"If we don't do this work, I'm worried that our approach to infill will only benefit affluent homeowners and developers. So we need to develop strategies that enable as many Portlanders as possible to benefit from the city's growth and prosperity and the coming residential infill policy changes. We need to do everything we can to harness market forces to produce more affordable housing."
05_02_2018,housing crisis,"[ORGANIZATION] are not going to solve our housing crisis alone, but they should be a significant part of our comprehensive strategy. I'm going to stop there and invite staff and some local experts to testify. We have [ORGANIZATION], Senior City Planner with [ORGANIZATION]."
05_02_2018,affordable housing,"So it's great for the person who rents it, who lives in it, but it still takes a certain level of affluence to create one in the first [STREET]. And what [ORGANIZATION] can do with new financial products, where there's frankly a market gap,  Perhaps property tax abatement assistance is to help make creating them more available. And if you want to achieve affordable, like regulated affordable housing and accessory dwelling units, there are some tools we can look at, like a waiver of your limited property tax while you have someone low income living in the ADU."
05_02_2018,affordable housing,"or if the city provides some financing, do a waiver on interest payments during the time that someone who's income-prolifying lives there at a low rent. So there are some tools we can explore, and we know, though, that from other cities that have linked  accessory dwelling units to regulated affordable housing, it's turned out to be a poison pill, intentioned or not. So I hope that [ORGANIZATION] does look for new ways that we can stimulate affordable housing and ADUs and look for some of the financing things that [ORGANIZATION] is working on with ORG1 to be a leader in that [STREET] as well."
05_02_2018,housing crisis,"But, I mean, honestly, the [ORGANIZATION] will probably be nicer than the main house. Yeah. Anyhow, it's a low-impact [STREET] to add density to our single-family neighborhoods, and it's also a [STREET] to invite average Portlanders to help us solve part of our housing crisis."
05_02_2018,affordable housing,"It was $8 million of lost revenue in parks in [ORGANIZATION] from the affordable housing waiver and that system development charge waivers. That's a lot of money that could be used for developing new parks in [ORGANIZATION], where you'll all remember those three lovely master plans that we approved that we don't have the money to build. So the waivers benefit homeowners and potentially the few renters who are renting those individual apartments."
05_02_2018,homeless,"You may know that we've done seismic work to upgrade and improve the resilience of homes. Recently, we've worked in the floodplain to help reduce folks' insurance costs and help stabilize those families. And we're also the organization working with the county and with [ORGANIZATION] to build the four pilot ADUs to help create housing for some homeless families."
05_02_2018,housing crisis,"We all know that we are in a housing crisis, and ADUs are not the solution to the problem. We need multifamily buildings. We have shelters."
05_02_2018,homelessness,"We see ADUs addressing homelessness, like in the units that we're building now, with programs wrapped around those construction projects. ADUs address low-income housing. ADUs can help folks stay in their homes, as we discussed earlier."
05_02_2018,homeless,"We're also working with [ORGANIZATION] on the ORG1 project, providing ADUs for homeless people. I've come here [ORGANIZATION] to give testimony on the resolution to extend the waiver of the service development charges on ADUs on behalf of our past, current, and future clients as well as their communities, not on behalf of my company. The resolution, should it pass, would be of great benefit to our company."
05_02_2018,housing crisis; affordable housing,"And I just see it as a humongous benefit to the housing and rental market. The [ORGANIZATION] waiver is an extremely successful [STREET] to incentivize new, compact, affordable infill housing built throughout the city. We're in the midst of a housing crisis in general, an affordable housing crisis in particular."
05_02_2018,housing crisis,"ADUs represent a creative solution to the housing crisis. We applaud [ORGANIZATION] for taking the national lead on enabling and encouraging people to build them. Well-designed ADUs can lower carbon footprints and create livelier, [PERSON] neighborhoods without demolition and disruption."
05_02_2018,affordable housing,"Let's put them on the inside to start with. And then I do have, and I intend to support this because I do think ADUs are a positive contribution with the conditions of this resolution for more affordable housing options. But I will say that I do have concerns in general about making something permanent, anything permanent."
05_02_2018,housing crisis; affordable housing,"So I do think it's incumbent upon us, the future councils, to really scrutinize this very closely, both for its impact on our infrastructure bureaus,  but also just to make sure that we are, this is still the part and parcel of the goal of solving our affordable housing crisis. If it somehow changes on us in the midstream, then we need to be able to claw back that benefit. Hi."
05_02_2018,affordable housing,"and I think our staff's got our wires crossed. First, I want to say I am in general support of the ORG0 development. The developer and all of the people involved are good actors in our affordable housing development community, and I was really excited by the potential that this lot offered."
05_02_2018,affordable housing,"And, and the developer didn't necessarily need to have that commercial floor and could, could have limited it, but there was no [STREET] that we could guarantee that we can't actually say, here's your new zoning with some restrictions. So my, my staff is going to be looking into creating some kind of affordable housing zoning plan.  where we could bring more height and units without having to add in the mixed use. So just want to make sure that I covered all the bases."
05_02_2018,affordable housing,"And as you heard me say [ORGANIZATION], we can't say we're for affordable housing but not in our neighborhood. And you have stepped up and said you are willing to accept more density and more housing in your neighborhood. Where I think people got squeamish on this was the idea of also introducing a commercial approach.  into an area that is not commercial."
05_02_2018,affordable housing,"So they have all come in requesting that the [ORGANIZATION] site go from R2.5 to R1 for the ability to do affordable housing. I would note that when we looked at this, we did note that while the church is on [ORGANIZATION], there is [PERSON] that abuts  I'm going to see if I can... This is [PERSON] right here."
05_02_2018,affordable housing,"That was a church that...  That proposal was actually FAC0, and the rationale was because there was some environmental zoning, and they partnered with [ORGANIZATION]. But this is an example of where there's the church, the prosperity initiative, and the affordable housing provider all coming together to make this request. Is this a first cousin of what we did at [ORGANIZATION]?"
05_02_2018,affordable housing,"So we're giving the people who asked and not really considering those who didn't ask. I would say in this case, since we have an affirmative interest in getting churches to develop property with affordable housing that links the beloved community with the housing in a campus setting, I think for me this is distinguishable. And to be clear, the neighborhood is aware of this, whether or not some of the adjacent property owners are, whether all the adjacent properties are."
02_21_2018,homeless,"They've been out [TIME]. We have had people working and volunteering in our homeless shelters, including severe weather shelters that we have opened. For the occasion, we have our utility bureaus working around the clock to make sure that our water and sewer services continue to be maintained."
02_21_2018,homelessness,And I know they're short-staffed and they're stressed. The epidemic of houselessness and homelessness and trying to provide housing services for people in poverty with disabilities is a tall order. Yeah.
02_21_2018,homelessness,"And as significant as that number is, [DATE] for every man, woman, and child in the state of [ORGANIZATION], that's actually down from its high of about 75 prescriptions for every man, woman, and child in [ORGANIZATION]. According to the [ORGANIZATION] Health Authority, three [ORGANIZATION]ians die [ORGANIZATION] due to prescription opioid use. Further, we know that opioid abuse is a major contributor to homelessness."
02_21_2018,homelessness,"With chronic homelessness on the rise in our community, and many of those experiencing homelessness reporting addiction issues, local jurisdictions like the city of [ORGANIZATION] are on the front lines of the opioid crisis. We're investing record amounts to address homelessness. We've committed to dramatically increasing the number of supporting housing units in our community, many of which will go to those suffering addiction issues."
02_21_2018,homelessness,"The city also, as you are all well aware, invests millions of dollars in [ORGANIZATION], which in addition to many of the programming that it provides, provides supportive housing services that assist people living with drug addiction. And finally, the city directly incurs costs as a self-insured provider for its employees and their families, so paying for prescription drugs and for the cost of treatment that employees and family members who are addicted to opioids. The public health crisis corresponds with the massive increase in prescription opioid sales."
02_21_2018,homeless,"Out here on the streets, I've seen it occur in a natural fashion. And when it's broken up, no offense, but by you guys, it's not long after that that you can't recognize the person you've seen because there's nothing left for them to do but drugs and there's no one left to associate with but the wrong people. It's ironic how we rely on social service agencies that neatly divide people between old and young, homeless, non-homeless, addict versus non-addict."
02_21_2018,homelessness; affordable housing,"The opioid crisis commands our attention and our action. This lawsuit is about recovering damages for the costs we've incurred managing this issue, and it also makes an important public statement. Over [ORGANIZATION], the federal government has abandoned local communities time and time again, disinvesting in affordable housing, homelessness services, crumbling roads and bridges, and urgent public health crises ranging from pollution in our rivers to drugs on our streets."
02_21_2018,affordable housing,"Commissioner [PERSON]? Mr. [PERSON], I think at the beginning of your presentation you mentioned in passing that this building would not be subject to our affordable housing requirements under inclusionary housing. I'm glad you mentioned that because over 15,000 units were filed ahead of the deadline."
02_21_2018,housing crisis,"We must consider this and all projects cumulatively and in light of our stated long-range planning goals, the Climate Action Plan, the Comprehensive Plan, Equity and Anti-Displacement Goals. We must ensure that the continued build out of [ORGANIZATION]'s urban core while enabling walking, biking and the use of transit, a proposal to build hundreds of units in our downtown core,  on an empty parking lot, accomplishes our public policy goals for public health, climate mitigation, and affordability. [ORGANIZATION] is in a declared housing crisis, but we did not get here [TIME]."
02_21_2018,affordable housing,"Part of the solution is strengthening tenants' rights. Part of the solution is securing more funding for affordable housing. And part of the solution is making sure that we do not continue to chronically underbuild housing, especially in our best connected places, if we are serious about addressing this issue."
02_21_2018,affordable housing,"So why not go ahead and apply for something that's allowed and subject it to design review? The association is prepared to live with that. And by the same token, going back to your question, Commissioner, if there's a reapplication, there's no need to comply with inclusionary zoning requirements for affordable housing."
04_21_2016,affordable housing,"And we're your family members. And our needs are not that different from anyone else's. And we need access to healthcare, affordable housing, safe neighborhood, and excellent education to be contributing members of the society."
03_04_2020,affordable housing,"Colleagues, in [ORGANIZATION], it was my pleasure to participate in the grand opening of [ORGANIZATION], a new affordable housing project. in our FAC0 neighborhood prosperity district. Our FAC0 is one of seven districts that make up the neighborhood prosperity network."
03_04_2020,affordable housing,"This program built on input that we received from key community partners as well as an analysis at the time that compared to other cities across the country, [ORGANIZATION] had relatively few community-led organizations focused on economic development. By contrast, we had a lot of community capacity around affordable housing, even a very significant understanding of land use, but this was an area when we compared ourselves to other cities that we saw we had room for growth. So this map shows the location of each of the seven districts, six of which are within micro tax increment finance districts."
03_04_2020,affordable housing,"The second one is, which you are very familiar with, is the FAC0 on FAC1, which is a true testament, again, of the affordable housing that [ORGANIZATION] did in partnership with ORG1. So these are great examples where, again, the community is showing its real strength and thoughtfulness with respects to the [STREET] in which the community is growing and really trying to retain the core of that community. Just a few more."
03_04_2020,homeless,"PERSON0? Yes. Item 172, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding the present state of the city's homeless crisis."
03_04_2020,homelessness,"Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding the homelessness epidemic. Is she here? No, sorry."
03_04_2020,homeless,"and their mental health. About one-third of our patients are homeless when they come to us, and everyone who graduates and completes the program, we make sure they have a [STREET] to go to when they leave as well as we've offered obtaining a job in those kinds of other skills as well. And about almost a third, about 28%, of our patients come from communities of color."
03_04_2020,houseless,"But as I'm sure you're keenly aware, we're seeing more drug addiction in our community. We're seeing more of our houseless population becoming addicted to [LOCATION] and other substances. And there are times when it feels that our system is being overwhelmed."
03_04_2020,homeless,"I like beer too much and I consider myself an expert on this topic. Number one is when I was homeless for [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION] and [ORGANIZATION], when I went to city team ministries, if they breathalyze you and you have alcohol, you're out on the [STREET]. And I really don't want to freeze in the cold weather and be drunk."
03_04_2020,affordable housing,"Even on the affordable housing bond, that's not an ongoing sustainable income stream. So again, on the mental health side and the addiction services... We should see in [ORGANIZATION] some amazing things happening, which is beneficial for the people and for their recovery and for them sustaining a life in which they can live in a housing unit supported and maintain that housing. And that's the key is to maintain that housing because these centers are less effective unless they can get into that housing and stay there."
03_04_2020,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]. You know, different types of populations become addicted for different reasons. You've got athletes."
03_04_2020,homeless,"How do we ensure that they don't just come back onto the streets or fall back into a cycle of addiction? Mm-hmm. And if there's one thing that gives me hope about our ability to address the homeless crisis, particularly as it relates to the most chronically homeless, those who've been homeless the longest, those who have coexisting conditions, whether it's addiction or mental health or disabilities, or whatever, it is the system-wide commitment we're starting to see around answering your question, what's next?"
03_04_2020,homeless; homelessness,"And since we're making plugs and soapboxing [TIME], I guess I'll just put in my plug for supporting and encouraging our regional partners and our state to meaningfully invest in homeless and housing services. One of the reasons we're seeing an increase in people with mental health issues and homelessness is that [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] is the de facto service provider for the region, and we really need our neighbors to be able to serve their own community members so people can stay in their communities where they have the best chance of recovering and getting back on their feet, and so that we can... begin to turn the tide on this really urgent matter. I've lost three family members to alcohol addiction and abuse."
03_04_2020,homelessness,"I didn't have time to look at the different resources of the city, but when we're in this situation where the other local governments that we sometimes [ORGANIZATION] with metro regional government is looking to give us maybe $300 million of [ORGANIZATION] renewable aid to homelessness. And then in [LOCATION], billions of dollars of transportation spending. I hope that the city... and [ORGANIZATION] will make it easier to find more information on the potential resolutions for changing this drainage district situation for FAC0."
03_04_2020,homeless,"Appreciate it. Good morning. Okay, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]."
03_04_2020,homeless,"And normally I would agree with [ORGANIZATION] about [ORGANIZATION] not getting money taken away. But frankly, if they would just stop their PERSON1 behavior around the bathrooms and the homeless, I mean, taxpayers pay for the parks. Homeless people should be able to use the bathroom."
03_04_2020,homeless,"That's why we're homeless. So I would say that having gone through 20 pages of government property and looking at subsidized housing and Section 8. And knowing that, again, I will use the words I used at [ORGANIZATION], any rich jerk can go out and buy these contractor housing and they can put in any manager and those managers can be abusive to disabled people."
03_04_2020,homeless,"people, females, and you know gender, race, LGBTQ, and those people can be out on the [STREET] because they want to do something else with that. And I want us to get properties and put in managers that are going to have a people who've been marginalized by society and are not socially connected and don't have power and are going to help them stay in their housing or get their housing because with an 80 percent compliance rate according to the contract with them not even making meeting 80% compliance rate and then [ORGANIZATION] looking the other [STREET] and saying oh you don't want to meet your compliance rates and having [ORGANIZATION] to make their compliance rate in [LOCATION] after [LOCATION] after [LOCATION] they never meet their compliance to put people into housing the number of the equity targets that they're supposed to meet [LOCATION] after [LOCATION] after [LOCATION]. They don't meet them and [ORGANIZATION] looks the other [STREET] and this is why we end up with a homeless problem."
03_04_2020,affordable housing,"Well, I want to thank you for your work, and I feel like we need to clarify a couple issues. There's a limit to what we can compel private developers to do. And so programs like inclusionary zoning and multi- are designed to either require or incentivize affordable housing at the [DATE], 80% level, which, while that does not serve the lowest income individuals in our community, it certainly does help fill a massive gap that exists in that community."
05_31_2017,affordable housing,"Item 565, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding micro-housing opportunities for affordable housing stock. Is [PERSON] here [ORGANIZATION]? We'll check him later and see if he comes in late."
05_31_2017,affordable housing,"I appreciate historic architecture, but it shouldn't override the essential need for housing. I believe that sometimes the use of historic designation is, consciously or not, a method to eliminate some neighborhoods from sharing in solutions for affordable housing. DATE0, [ORGANIZATION] had a segment called Section 8 Vouchers Help the Poor, but Only if [ORGANIZATION]."
05_31_2017,affordable housing,"I realize Section 8 is not the same as affordable housing structures or units, but the principle here is the same. The voucher in [ORGANIZATION] was designed to be, I'm quoting from an article that I gave to you, to be a ticket out of poverty, allowing families to use it wherever they want. With a portable voucher, families can move to places with jobs, good schools, and low crime."
05_31_2017,affordable housing,"It's incumbent upon [ORGANIZATION] to develop affordable housing in every part of the city. I don't know what part of the solution, I mean, maybe we need a PR program, literally ads or something, that get this message across to the city that everybody can live everywhere and that every neighborhood should have affordable housing. I'm not sure how we go about that, but anyhow."
05_31_2017,affordable housing,"Thank you for your testimony [ORGANIZATION], and thank you for making such an eloquent statement about locating affordable housing in every neighborhood. We are criticized regularly for putting affordable housing in what's called high-opportunity neighborhoods. Right."
05_31_2017,affordable housing,"And so some say we should look to the lowest cost housing, which means building in places that don't have the same opportunity. Right. And what we understand is that when we build affordable housing, say, in southwest [ORGANIZATION] next to a high-achieving school, those kids have a better chance."
05_31_2017,housing crisis; affordable housing,"Yes. And so... I completely, I think we embrace what you've said, and we thank you for making such an eloquent statement for everyone participating and helping solve the affordable housing crisis."
05_31_2017,affordable housing,"And 608? 608.  Amend relocation assistance regulations in affordable housing preservation and [ORGANIZATION] renter protections. And without objection, that's also been rolled over to [ORGANIZATION]. And so the next item will be 572."
05_31_2017,homelessness,"Next item, please. Item 590, require short-term rental platforms to collect an additional $2 per room night for housing and homelessness initiatives and expand the tourism improvement district to include short-term rental platforms. Commissioner [PERSON]?  Am I turning this one over to you?"
05_31_2017,homeless,"And while opinions vary as to the magnitude, clearly there is some impact. In recognition of that impact, the resolution before you [ORGANIZATION] directs [ORGANIZATION] of [ORGANIZATION] to draft an ordinance requiring short-term rental platforms to collect an additional $2 per booking night to be dedicated to housing and homeless initiatives and to help mitigate the impact that short-term rentals have on the housing market generally. There are at least two other cities in the [ORGANIZATION] that have implemented similar per-night type fees."
05_31_2017,housing crisis,"Third, the city is about to sit down and undertake negotiations with [ORGANIZATION] for the purposes of attempting to bring them into full compliance with our laws, including to collect arrears from taxes that they have not paid in the past. And finally, [ORGANIZATION], this measure, recognizing that there is an adverse impact on the housing crisis by taking these units offline, proposes that we add a $2 per night fee and that an ordinance come back to us for that purpose. In totality, the actions we've taken...  recognize that with changes in technology, people are increasingly going to be booking units using the Internet, their computer or their phone, and technology provides convenient ways of doing so."
05_31_2017,affordable housing,"If you could speak to an estimated...  I don't know if we have even good intel about how many units are on the market for those services. Well, just we do know – and it's a great question, [ORGANIZATION]. We did get a report, I think, during [ORGANIZATION] of all the revenue that's reported from short-term rentals –  because by council ordinance that revenue goes into the housing investment fund and is used to build and preserve affordable housing."
05_31_2017,affordable housing,So we did make a conscious decision to take the revenue stream for short-term rentals and use it to mitigate the impact on affordable housing. We have quantified the amount of the existing revenue. The challenge here is that there are so many units that are under the radar because the platforms have failed and refused to give us the names and addresses of their hosts.
05_31_2017,housing crisis,"PERSON0. Well, I want to thank [PERSON] for bringing this forward, and I think it's an innovative idea to –  leverage the benefits of the short-term rental market and to generate some additional monies to deal with the impact on our housing crisis. There was some testimony earlier about, to the extent that the effect that we're over-regulating."
05_31_2017,housing crisis,"Thank you, Commissioner. I want to thank Commissioner [PERSON] for his passion on this issue and for his commentary. There's no question that short-term rentals are contributing to a global housing crisis, as well as our own local housing crisis.  is serving as an accelerant to growing wealth inequality."
05_31_2017,houseless,"Or just the little thumb, the victim sucking his thumb, feeling sorry for themselves, they asked for it. But it's also the pointer finger that points out who's allowed to be abused. Houseless, poor, mentally ill, people of color, [ORGANIZATION], gender minorities, religious minorities, political activists."
05_31_2017,affordable housing,"We have a number of staff members who've waited very patiently [ORGANIZATION]. Please read the item. Item 606, authorized conveyance of city-owned property located at [ADDRESS] to [ORGANIZATION], and funding in an amount not to exceed $11,434,111 to [ORGANIZATION], and its affiliate, [ORGANIZATION], for the construction of a new 93-unit affordable housing development."
05_31_2017,affordable housing,"I'd also like to recognize that the site was acquired by [ORGANIZATION] for $1.2 million, a little bit less than its current value of $1.9 million in [ORGANIZATION], and this was a site acquired from [ORGANIZATION] under duress to help fulfill obligations for affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] was the director of [ORGANIZATION] at the time that the site was acquired, and he was supported by [PERSON], our housing finance manager, and [ORGANIZATION], who is our project manager. The other thing that I think is important to mention is that ORG2 has effectively increased the density of the property through a density transfer of [PERSON]'s historic [LOCATION] property in the neighborhood."
05_31_2017,homeless,"So we were able to achieve an additional 16 affordable units over and above what they originally proposed in the [ORGANIZATION] proposal that they proffered to [ORGANIZATION].  $11.4 million is a lot of money, but this also leverages additional resources. The total project cost is some $35.8 million, which includes financial support from [ORGANIZATION], ORG2, [PERSON], [PERSON] itself, which has contributed a portion of its developer's fee to the project,  and [ORGANIZATION] through ORG6, because there are some project-based rental assistance vouchers attached to this particular project. And the real good news story here is that we're supporting homeless families in one of the most attractive neighborhoods of [ORGANIZATION], the [ORGANIZATION], and people who are working in the district."
05_31_2017,homelessness,"And as [ORGANIZATION] said, 40 of the units, well, 45 of the units will be set aside for families that earn no more than 30%. 40 of those households will be coming directly out of homelessness. So that helps bring down the average income of the households."
05_31_2017,homeless,"But we do find that most families we house struggle significantly, not only with income, but also with some other challenges. So we find that in order to help them succeed and stay stable in their housing, we really need to bring wraparound services. So in addition to our partnership with [ORGANIZATION], who will be referring the homeless families, and with [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] and many of the other organizations that provide case management services,  which is much more comprehensive alcohol and drug counseling, different things that families might need."
05_31_2017,homeless,"We provide resident services on site. We will have a full-time staff person dedicated to this building, not only to serve the homeless families, but all 93 of our households. Our basic resident service program includes orientations and basic needs assessments."
05_31_2017,affordable housing,So I guess we should acknowledge [ORGANIZATION]. This is part of the allocation that they made to ensure that we could get deeply affordable housing. It is indeed.
05_31_2017,homelessness,"And maybe this is obvious, but we're talking about a lot of units for very low-income people, and many of them families coming off the streets, so coming out of homelessness, which is great. And you've talked about the wraparound services on site. So do these qualify as permanent supportive housing units, or are they functionally the equivalent?"
05_31_2017,affordable housing,"We had someone [TIME], to Commissioner [PERSON]'s point, who was here who spoke during the public comment, and she said we should be distributing affordable housing in neighborhoods across the city. And we talked about what it is to be in a high-opportunity area. To have family-friendly housing, deeply affordable, in the [ORGANIZATION], I mean, is about as good as you can get."
05_31_2017,homeless,The 40 homeless families will be referred through the GPE0 Homeless Family [PERSON]. So the county will refer those that get to access the project-based vouchers. Okay.
05_31_2017,affordable housing,"Absolutely. Great, thank you. The [ORGANIZATION] fee, [ORGANIZATION] company, has been retained by [ORGANIZATION] so that in the future, vacancies in the entire permanent affordable housing,  of some 14,000 units DATE0, vacancies will be placed through that online service."
05_31_2017,homelessness,"This is a fabulous partnership, and I think –  One of the reasons it is so successful is all these different organizations coming together. You have the project sponsor, [ORGANIZATION],  [PERSON] for it, as has been discussed, has provided the Section 8 vouchers. ORG2 is partnering with the Multnomah County [PERSON]lessness Services, so we've got the county throwing their wholehearted support and infrastructure and capacity behind this important effort."
05_31_2017,affordable housing,"I think it was 35% of the housing that was put in this development would be affordable housing. And the reason that the city purchased and was able to purchase this particular lot, known as [ORGANIZATION], from [ORGANIZATION] was because, according to the agreement, they had not met that threshold of affordable housing. And so the city was able to purchase this lot at a discount and –  Fortunately, [ORGANIZATION] has stepped up to the plate and is going to provide us with another income-restricted or low-income affordable housing, whatever you want to call it."
05_31_2017,homelessness,"It meets so many of the city's goals. It serves the poorest of the poor within our community and with a focus on people who have experienced homelessness and want to get back on their feet. It's in a high-opportunity area, which means we're investing in a [STREET] that low-income, moderate-income, wealthy households would like to live, and so it advances our goal of giving people meaningful choice."
05_31_2017,affordable housing,"When we build beautiful train stations and public amenities, people usually don't come out and say you're wasting money on that. When we invest in beautiful parks, people usually come and celebrate the fact and not criticize us. I'd like to think that we have the same pride in investing public resources in long-term affordable housing, which is part of the asset base of a healthy community."
05_31_2017,affordable housing,"I am, of course, very excited about this project and especially happy to hear that you have 100% visitability and 100% adaptability and the partnership with [ORGANIZATION] because as short as we are in affordable housing, we're perhaps even shorter on accessible housing. Thank you.  [ORGANIZATION]. Well, thanks to everybody involved."
05_31_2017,affordable housing,"Appreciate it. Last item, I believe. Item 604, authorize $220,922,137 million of general obligation bonds for affordable housing projects."
05_31_2017,affordable housing,"Aye. Thank you again, Mr. [PERSON], Commissioners, [ORGANIZATION], City Debt Manager. This emergency ordinance does authorize $220.9 million approximately of additional general obligation debt to fund affordable housing costs."
05_31_2017,affordable housing,We are authorizing at some point in the future debt management to issue debt up to $220 million so that we can invest in affordable housing development. The bond measure actually has some very specific criteria around who we serve and at what income level. We've also established an oversight body whose task it will be to provide advice to [ORGANIZATION] on projects as they come up.
03_09_2016,homeless,"So when I look at the front of the [ORGANIZATION], and here's a woman in children's shelter, and they don't have the money to expand and to protect these people, it really makes me wonder how the city can do these deals where they're giving away millions, and they can't come up with the money to protect people  the homeless, women and children. I'm a product of a broken family. We used to have to open up the oven and turn on the heat because the oil tank was empty."
03_09_2016,homelessness,"216, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding homelessness. PERSON1? Okay, then let's move on to the..."
03_09_2016,affordable housing,And we are at regular agenda item 226. All right. Allow city subsidized affordable housing projects to utilize a type 2X land use review procedure pursuant to [ORGANIZATION] 33.730.025 for the duration of the housing emergency.
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"Go ahead and read 227 too also. 227. Direct ORG0 to develop a legislative proposal to amend Title 33 as part of Regulatory Improvement Code Amendment Package, RICAP No. 8, to simplify regulations, remove regulatory obstacles, and expedite processes for land use reviews and permits for affordable housing projects, mass shelters, and short-term housing."
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"Thank you. Thanks, [ORGANIZATION]. This resolution and ordinance will further [ORGANIZATION] commitment to addressing our affordable housing emergency."
03_09_2016,affordable housing,It also represents one of the many collaborative outcomes between [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] to expand our city's stock of affordable housing. And I'd like to thank Mayor [PERSON] for his support of these efforts and his sponsorship of these items. And the resolution directs ORG2 to conduct a legislative process  to identify other opportunities to increase affordable housing through the land use process and the ordinance establishes a new type of review process for affordable housing projects only and here to explain more is our housing director [PERSON] and development services director [ORGANIZATION] is here always to keep us honest  keep us on tack
03_09_2016,affordable housing,so uh please take it away thank you very much commissioner [ORGANIZATION] mr mayor members of [ORGANIZATION] my name is [PERSON] and i'd like to at least uh remind you that on [ORGANIZATION] the [ORGANIZATION] had a study session on  what we termed at that time the high cost of affordable housing.
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"And just to refresh your memory and for the record, we evaluated all the current data as it related to housing prices of affordable housing. And we were able to isolate the cost drivers of affordable housing. Some 77% of the costs were hard costs."
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"That is land, building, and labor principally. 14% of the costs of affordable housing were  was in what we call soft costs. That's architecture and engineering fees, its interest, its taxes, legal expenses, and the like."
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"So it's not to diminish sort of the value added, but to –  to put it in perspective, to recognize that we do have a housing emergency and that the changes recommended to you [ORGANIZATION] are, in effect, a [STREET] by which to beta test in a short term [LOCATION], process improvements that could result in more affordable housing more quickly. I can go into more detail, but I'd like [ORGANIZATION] to talk a little bit about the specifics. Thank you, [PERSON]."
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"I'd have to have a deeper conversation. So in your presentation, you've been very clear that there's no dilution of design standards. And I want to pick up on that for a second because one of the noteworthy things about city-owned or city-invested affordable housing is  is that it is typically not what communities rail against."
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"That is, when you hear from folks in [ORGANIZATION] about crappy housing that is not designed in a [STREET] that's sensitive or respectful of the community, it is often the private market housing that's been slapped up and that looks like if a good windstorm comes, it'll be knocked down. Some of the most durable long-term and beautiful housing is the housing that the city has partnered with a nonprofit developer to build, and I can give you a thousand examples. So can you ensure us – and by the [STREET], I think that when we're using public dollars to invest in affordable housing, we should approach that just like we're building a [INSTITUTION] or a transportation hub or anything else."
03_09_2016,affordable housing,You just need to say yes. I definitely want to affirm your statement that affordable housing is not inferior housing. We don't need to cut corners with respect to the durability of materials or amenities.
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] is focused on reviewing projects that are developing  for sure, meeting the development standards, the design guideline, we would be looking at affordable housing similar as we would in private development and making sure those requirements are being met. That's the passion and the professional approach from all staff working in the design and historic sections. So that's something we can commit to because that's what we do."
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"So one of the – and I appreciate Commissioner [PERSON] pointing this out for me. So in the second item we're going to take up, we are directing –  planning sustainability to review some of these other cost drivers, kind of below the line cost drivers, and including in that is a consideration as to whether Commissioner [PERSON]'s green building policy will apply to affordable housing. I just want to make sure I understand that."
03_09_2016,affordable housing,i think it's a fair conversation to have and we'll be happy to have that with them yes why is it a fair conversation that doesn't it before the council says we want to undo a policy we that [ORGANIZATION] put into law and defended for [ORGANIZATION] why why are we asking someone to revisit it well i don't think we're i mean we're asking [ORGANIZATION] ORG1 and [ORGANIZATION] commission to to look at the mix of things that may inhibit the delivery of affordable housing
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"And I think the green building policy, it's always been a source of debate in the affordable housing arena. And I think it's a fair debate to have. And I welcome [ORGANIZATION] taking a look at it."
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"It's written very broadly to remove obstacles and find ways to expedite projects that deal with mass shelters, affordable housing, and short-term housing. I'll just say for the record, this is the first time I can remember on my watch on the council where we've said that  we're going to ask someone to evaluate whether we should backtrack on our sustainability goals as to one class of housing as a [STREET] of saving money. And that's not the standard that we apply in any other setting."
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"I have a few other – yes, I believe –  One of the elephants in the room is that the commissioner in charge of housing is also in charge of development services, and under other circumstances I might be concerned about that. Having seen Commissioner [PERSON] and the [STREET] he manages his bureaus, I am not at all concerned that he's going to be directing his staff in development services to approve affordable housing projects just to get them done. He has a history of respecting the process, respecting the land use guidelines,  review and indeed respecting his staff in development services and so i personally am confident that he will continue to allow the staff who i have found to be absolutely excellent in the design review section as in the rest of development services to do their work without interference so i just wanted to state that on the record  and thank you all for the work that you do."
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"As was pointed out, applicants, if they prefer their chances with the city council rather than the design commission, can start with the design commission and come to us. So it seems to me that this is an appropriate switch, at least pending hearing testimony, and also looking at it as a stopgap measure rather than something that we're enacting  as a permanent basis, there's then a burden on the process and on the staff to prove that, in fact, we haven't reduced the standards or diminished the design of affordable housing in the pilot project. So that's the [STREET] I'm looking at it."
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"My biggest concern is about that this change would –  I was glad to see that it requires city subsidy of at least five units at 60% of median family income or less. I'm wondering what's to stop a developer from going through the 2X process with the city subsidy to then say, oh, never mind, I'm actually going to build luxury condos instead. And they've already got the approval for the design, and they then don't give us the affordable housing."
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"And what would trigger that? When we saw a building permit that came in and we were alerted from [ORGANIZATION] that, oh, they are not going to do the affordable housing they said they were going to do. So you could have some kind of a flag within?"
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"yes great thank you very much i'm also going to offer an amendment on that five units after we hear some testimony from one of our design commissioners my final uh point i just want to put on the record that the council in the context of the comprehensive plan has been discussing making affordable housing the public benefit in  in for bonuses, for example. And so I want to be very clear and maybe get some head nods from my fellow commissioners. We're not making decisions on the comprehensive plan."
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"However, we have been having significant discussions about affordable housing as a public benefit, and I want to be clear that that's partly why this is coming towards us and that that is something for [ORGANIZATION] and others to consider, that that's the direction that council may be heading in the comprehensive plan. Head nodding provided. Thank you."
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"This is more related to 227 than 226, but...  We've already, I think all of us, asked the bureaus that engage in permitting to prioritize affordable housing. What I've heard is that we've also asked them to prioritize other things like [ORGANIZATION] and the ORG1 project, etc., So, I think that we need to be sure that we're all telling our people in the permitting bureaus, here is what the priority ranking is and you will spend, we recognize you will spend less time on X when you're spending more time on Y."
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"So how transparent can we be with the development community about saying you can expect your non-affordable housing projects to be pushed back by [ORGANIZATION] because of this? And one sub-question is... When we're prioritizing affordable housing, does that mean that projects that are non-affordable housing projects that are currently in the queue that have been told that you may expect that they will have the project completed within DATE1  Will the affordable housing projects jump the queue so that those projects in the queue will be pushed back?"
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"I appreciate the question and concern. It's competing priorities, and so at some point it becomes philosophical versus realistic, because you can only – there's so much capacity, limited capacity. So what we've done as a solution is to add more staff.  and communicate the sort of priority reality that if you want to focus on [ORGANIZATION], you want to focus on affordable housing, you want to focus on something else, if you're trying to do it with the same number of staff, it just doesn't work."
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"They all have a role to play in this processing. So we're mindful that when a decision is made to prioritize one project and another project is given a lesser priority, I'm not sure that the system really allows you to –  to then put an alert out to the next project in line to say that you'll be [ORGANIZATION] than you would have been normally, as long as it occurs within the same allotted time that this council is established as a benchmark. We might not be able to be that specific project by project, but I do think it would be useful if we tried to provide whatever information we can to the development community saying, you've heard that we're prioritizing affordable housing, you might have some concerns about what that will mean for non-affordable housing projects."
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"tens of thousands of deficit units in affordable housing for people under 60% MFI. I think it was about 25,000 units short. I hope that number will get more and more discussion, not so much here, but as we move towards [ORGANIZATION], because those people really need to know that they need to activate and support proposals like this and even more aggressive proposals so that  the housing can, we can move forward with housing."
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"and then certainly can discuss some specifics as to some of the issues that you've already raised. Thank you. Mayor [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION], thank you for the opportunity to comment on the ordinance to allow city subsidized affordable housing to be reviewed through a type 2x design historic review instead of a type 3 design historic review."
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"The design commission fully supports the creation and expediting of abundant affordable housing in our city. We recently reviewed two housing projects where we offered additional guidance, additional times to meet, and additional support for these projects to the development team. We are committed to assisting the expedient construction of affordable housing projects."
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"However, this proposed ordinance was only shared with us [ORGANIZATION], and we would have preferred more time to have a thorough conversation about how to reach our collective goals. Thank you. We believe additional work is needed to help the needs of affordable housing, such as fee breaks and a swifter and more predictable Type III process."
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"Ideally, the land use process remains equal across the board for all types of projects. Affordable housing projects deserve the same level of respect and scrutiny as their neighbors. Affordable housing will be long-lasting and should be designed and reviewed with that in mind."
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"Under the proposed ordinance, that project would have only needed to provide five affordable housing units in order to avoid a Type 3 review. We request that the [ORGANIZATION] revisit the minimum requirements and provide a more meaningful threshold. For instance, at least 25% of the proposed housing units of a primarily housing project must be city-subsidized affordable housing units."
03_09_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,Thank you again for your creativity and leadership in finding ways in which to address [ORGANIZATION]'s affordable housing crisis. Please know that we are a resource to you and always willing to participate in work groups that provide guidance for legislation such as this ordinance. This is my favorite.
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] is committed to supporting high-quality, low-maintenance, affordable housing where the residents are proud of their home and the neighbors are proud to have the project in their neighborhood. There's also a letter submitted from [ORGANIZATION]. I don't know if they're here or not."
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"Thank you. [ORGANIZATION] is much attuned to and supportive of the need to retain existing affordable housing that is often the target of demolition, and we certainly support the development of additional affordable housing. There are many examples of historic buildings being successfully redeveloped into affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION], including most recently FAC0 in LOC0, and we would love to see more of that."
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"If we're concerned about the money and the city is investing money, it would seem like it would be a pragmatic approach to waive the additional fee that is required for these affordable housing projects. And when looking at affordable housing, and there was a comment brought up regarding 22-gauge exterior versus 18-gauge, affordable housing has an established history of significant deferred maintenance, and that is one of the reasons that you put a more durable surface on there so that you do not have that apparent degrading of the exterior in it. And that would seem like the city's investment would be very concerned about the longevity of that."
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"And we're talking about time and money here, and so time is going to be longer. Money is something that can be reduced just by a simple statement that it's no longer going to be required for affordable housing. And then also within the history element, the recreation needs of goal number eight would have to be ignored."
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"I'm an architect. and principle of new traditional architecture. During that time, if I may, I have always also been architectural consultant to [ORGANIZATION], specializing in affordable housing throughout the state."
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"Now, the importance of  of public input, although Commissioner [PERSON] obviously is correct in terms of the opportunity, the opportunity for public input in the Type 2X process is much, much, much less than the opportunity is in the Type 3. The relative costs, in addition to the time of the design view, are minuscule if  If affordable housing units cost about $500,000 apiece or $300,000 apiece, then, well, that's what they were when I was working at the state commissioner. Let's say 230, okay?"
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"It's a philosophical conceptual understanding. So we're removing the standards, and the [STREET] to do this is just to take the funds that would otherwise be used to supplement –  the affordable housing and make sure that part of those funds are used to cover the development costs, which include review. Let's see."
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"The notion of maintaining the quality of housing, whether it be affordable housing or whether it be market rate, and really the difference is with with methods of funding. Whether we're talking about either of those, then we're really talking about the the notion of the all-important notion of nimbyism, not in my backyard, the reluctance of  of citizens to have substandard housing in their neighborhood and the clarity with which folks who live in substandard housing, by substandard, I mean very clearly, not designed as well or not designed as compatibly with the neighborhood to increase and maintain livability. It will be so obvious to everyone that the residents, they have not the means to live someplace better."
03_09_2016,affordable housing,I'm a very strong advocate of both the retention and creation of affordable housing. I'm a [ORGANIZATION] resident and I'm doing what I can to preserve the exceptionally dense number of affordable housing buildings in that neighborhood against potential demolition threats posed by the excessive height allowances proposed by [LOCATION] plan.
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"But the public process is a foundation of good government, and the effective loss of this part of the process creates a reduction in transparency and a danger of decisions done in the proverbial smoke-filled back rooms. With this change will also be the loss of an opportunity to publicly tell the stories attached to these buildings as they are readapted for an admittedly terribly important use as affordable housing. We are a forgetful species and need reminding how else but through the public process do we learn about the nearly lost story of the first maternal hospital in [ORGANIZATION]."
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"So we can provide both direct and indirect assistance to affordable housing developers  principally private developers, and this could receive favorable design treatment in the future if they have at least 20 units within them. So that applies. Thank you."
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"And then I also wanted to just get on the record that we will have a report back to [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION] or in the end of [ORGANIZATION] about how this works. experiment went. And we will also, [ORGANIZATION] will require that all applicants who wish to participate in this type 2X process have a signed agreement with [ORGANIZATION] that outlines their responsibilities under the regulatory agreements to provide actual affordable housing."
03_23_2016,homeless,"You're next, Mr. [PERSON]. So I wanted to suggest that you guys actually do a better job on housing by buying a bunch of the foreclosure properties that have made a lot of people homeless to begin with. And there's a 37% vacancy rate in foreclosures in [ORGANIZATION] and the [ORGANIZATION] area."
03_23_2016,homeless,"i i was actually homeless for a long time and i tried to check into some of the hostels around here and i found out that you have to be an out-of-state resident you can't be a a local resident to even go to the hostels around here so  Basically, all the hostels around here are not even accessible to homeless people that could afford to possibly spend [TIME] at a [STREET] instead of a cheap, crappy motel."
03_23_2016,homeless,"so actually we have some folks working on that very problem because you're right there's some empty houses out there that have actually sat around empty a long time so appreciate you bringing that up okay [ORGANIZATION] homeless people could actually come in  Working on that. Okay, Mr. [PERSON], thank you."
03_23_2016,affordable housing,"bye okay let's move on to [ADDRESS] to develop a 39 unit affordable rental housing project commissioner  Thank you, Mayor. I'm very pleased [ORGANIZATION] to bring forward this proposal to fund much-needed, deeply affordable housing in the FAC1 neighborhood of southwest [ORGANIZATION]. This is a funding decision that resulted from our [PERSON]."
03_23_2016,homeless,"I think we're very pleased to be able to provide a high number of units in the project that are at and below 30 percent of our immediate income. And as you mentioned, we work on the employment side to help find jobs and start careers for over 500 formerly homeless people [DATE]. And the rental market, as you know, is very, very tight."
03_23_2016,homeless,"And since, you know, units that are zero to 30 and medium family income are the kind of homes that currently homeless people might qualify for and older adults on disability and others. And it's something we're deeply committed to. And this is an exciting development."
03_23_2016,affordable housing,"Could I just add one other thing, Mayor? We've –  we started to kick around an idea i just want to flag for you and then at some point we'll follow up with you you're going to you're going to develop this project and at some point the residents may come to you and say we'd like to have some vending machines in the building and it's not not atypical and that's why we often find vending machines that have sodas and snacks at shelters and affordable housing developments And I've always wondered when we do that why we put some of the least healthy food in facilities with some of the most vulnerable people."
03_23_2016,homeless,"You know, we, through our efforts,  Our primary care, we're serving about 8,000 people a year just through the primary care. And 2,000 of those are literally homeless. And about another 2,000 are either in transitional housing and shelters, doubled up, that sort of thing."
03_23_2016,homeless,"And what did did did that support 100 jobs of 100 caseworkers to get these 500 jobs? Because [ORGANIZATION].  as they wage their war on homeless people and also act like they're the helping hand, the nice abusive father that smacks you [DATE] and tells you to go to your room for [ORGANIZATION] and you're not eaten. And then comes in and like, Oh, I'm here to save you."
03_23_2016,homeless,"You know? So, you know, central city concern or this big behemoth monster that go around and they, uh,  evict homeless people. They're one of the main policing agencies that evict homeless people."
03_23_2016,homeless,"My parents used to make $2,000 a day before they were made homeless by the government busting them for a little bit of weed and trying to forfeit their property. So I could open up 10 or 20 warehouses and create homes. 500 jobs myself."
03_23_2016,affordable housing,And I want to acknowledge [ORGANIZATION] in my office for helping to work directly with [ORGANIZATION] and getting that property to the point where it can now be developed for very low income affordable housing. So thanks to everybody for a great job. Hi.
03_23_2016,homeless; affordable housing,yeah i wanted to state too that i'm not um against the affordable housing obviously i believe that you know the city needs a lot more affordable housing but i also think that you guys could actually do it a lot cheaper by creating tiny homes and building them and putting people in those you know and  I don't think that [ORGANIZATION] is a good organization because they seem to war on the homeless a lot.
04_09_2015,homeless,"driving and the drivers and their family could quickly become homeless and consequently depend upon welfare. The burden was their fall on the city and ultimately the taxpayer. As we all know, with the taxi service, it is all about supply and demand."
06_06_2018,affordable housing,"So starting with [ORGANIZATION], we've held ORG1 sessions on a number of different issues. We've worked on streamlining affordable housing development and on increasing housing supply. We've worked on improving our 911 call response to national standards."
06_06_2018,houseless,"And I'm saying that while I understand what the money is supposed to go for, I don't know that that's what the money is going to and how much of that money is actually going to hurt me and my brothers and sisters on the [STREET], whether it's in the black community, the houseless community, the migrant-immigrant community, anything, the Muslim community. Okay.  Very good. I don't know if you have a response to that in terms of how the decisions are made about the distribution of the funds and the accountability."
06_06_2018,affordable housing,"Sadly, the latest amendments to the plan over [ORGANIZATION] have the appearance of supporting particular property owners to the detriment of others. We are in dire need of affordable housing options that serve all Portlanders, particularly those who are low income and at risk of displacement. These options need not come at such a high price as the destruction of the unique cultural and historic assets of the new FAC0 and LOC0."
06_06_2018,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] [DATE] lays the groundwork for [ORGANIZATION] to continue to be a thriving economic, cultural, educational, and recreational hub for the region for [ORGANIZATION]. It carries on the tradition of previous plans that resulted in transforming FAC0 into FAC1, a parking garage into FAC2, and brownfields into [LOCATION] and LOC2. What this plan does differently is that it sets the stage for more affordable housing, increased resilience in the face of climate change, more and better jobs through a synergistic mix of old and new industry in [LOCATION], better protection of our iconic scenic views, and deeper focus on our greatest natural feature, [ORGANIZATION]."
04_29_2015,homelessness,"And I just wanted to come here [TIME] to thank you, Mr. [PERSON] and Commissioner [PERSON], and the [ORGANIZATION] for its continued support and leadership on behalf of the city's most vulnerable. And in particular, I'm speaking to your support for shelter off the [STREET] options for women who are experiencing homelessness and also for support to housing options for veterans and for their families. With regards to women's sheltering, by transitioning what has been a women's [ORGANIZATION] shelter to a [LOCATION] women's emergency shelter, the city will be helping to provide continued assistance and, frankly, safety for up to 700 women."
04_29_2015,homelessness,"but it requires additional funding at the city level to leverage those dollars most effectively and help us [STREET] towards our common goal, which, of course, is to end veteran homelessness, functionally speaking, by [ORGANIZATION]. That's going to be a tough effort. We believe it's attainable, but it will be all hands on deck, and we're very grateful to count all of your hands on that deck as well."
04_29_2015,homeless; homelessness,"Sure. So I'm [PERSON] and I'm the manager of [ORGANIZATION] at [ORGANIZATION]. And I'm here mostly just to say thank you to [ORGANIZATION] for all the support that we felt through the 25 City Initiative, the Mayor's Challenge to End Veteran Homelessness."
04_29_2015,affordable housing,"Also, I'll be quick. I wasn't able to be at your budget hearing on [ORGANIZATION] because I was at [ORGANIZATION].  which is also of great concern to many of us. And I just want to support the others."
04_29_2015,homelessness,"My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I'm the Executive Director of [ORGANIZATION]. And I'm here [ORGANIZATION] to thank you, the [ORGANIZATION] as a whole, for the support on the money for ending veterans' homelessness."
04_29_2015,homelessness; affordable housing,"I also want to ask for your continued leadership as we seek to recruit additional landlords in the private rental market. It is taking the joint team about two to three times as long to secure units. And as we move through [ORGANIZATION] and seek to increase the availability of landlords for affordable housing, we're asking for your leadership in that to bring people to the table to support financial resources needed to maintain those relationships and to align the city's affordable housing development with ending homelessness goals."
04_29_2015,houseless,Is this going to be out-of-state labor? I have a suggestion. There's a lot of houseless folks that could use some work right now because nobody is hiring houseless folks as far as I know.
04_29_2015,houseless,I don't think it's going to be as difficult or as problematic as some people might think or try to impose. I think this could be very cooperative with the city and the houseless. And I would recommend that you look into it and take a hard look at trying to get some of the houseless folks involved.  to work.
04_29_2015,homelessness,"First of all, I want to echo and agree with just about everybody who spoke here [ORGANIZATION] on the various different issues. I haven't heard anything that I disagree with. So in terms of how do we develop our neighborhoods, how do we deal with the issues of veterans' homelessness, homelessness in general, all of the different subjects."
04_29_2015,affordable housing,"So it's rich in data, but it's also sobering in its message. Thank you. and I hope that we will all, as a result of this report, rededicate ourselves to increasing the supply of affordable housing and continuing to help those who are most vulnerable to changes in our economic climate."
04_29_2015,affordable housing,"As I said, this report is rich in other data and on [ORGANIZATION], its affordable housing portfolio, expenditures related to affordable housing, and we will be seeking ORG2 and community feedback on this report,  to help make sure that it becomes, as I said, it will become a regular occurrence in [ORGANIZATION] of [LOCATION] that we will present this report. So we're presenting it to you now in [DATE], but we will be doing a supplement to this and getting it on a regular [ORGANIZATION] cycle. And it will also become more or less the vehicle for which many of the reports that  uh [PERSON] is required by one ORG2 ordinance or another to submit to ORG2 we will try to get those all incorporated into one comprehensive report that you such as you have before us now"
04_29_2015,homelessness,"Part four, as [ORGANIZATION] mentioned, presents information on the historic reporting, the programming and direct expenditure of [ORGANIZATION] on homelessness and housing programming, and then part five comments on the methodology. Thank you. So at a citywide and a neighborhood level, the first section of analysis is really looking at the demographic data."
04_29_2015,affordable housing,It shows that we are meeting the adopted policy goal of an aggregate citywide minimum of 30% of tax increment financing dedicated to affordable housing. We talk a bit about that on page 85 of your report. Thank you.
04_29_2015,affordable housing,"So what we learn is that investing in housing affordability works. DATE0, the number of regulated affordable housing units in [ORGANIZATION] ballooned from 12,800 in [LOCATION] to nearly 20,000 DATE2. And of those regulated units, 65% were funded, at least in part, by [LOCATION] [ORGANIZATION]."
04_29_2015,affordable housing,"Thank you. So preserving the city's investment in our affordable housing infrastructure is a cost-effective and vital intervention. The city currently regulates through [ORGANIZATION] over 12,000 units that we have invested in to keep their rents affordable for our citizens."
04_29_2015,affordable housing,"The [ORGANIZATION] currently prioritizes our preservation work, but, I mean, of course, that stock is aging. And so in upcoming reports, the [ORGANIZATION] is going to share more details with ORG1 about your affordable housing infrastructure. So the [STREET], a couple more pieces of information, the [STREET] that the city's investment in the preservation and creation of affordable housing is funded is two primary ways."
04_29_2015,affordable housing,"This is all from [ORGANIZATION] for a variety of kinds of affordable housing investments. [ORGANIZATION] has dropped quite a bit over time, although it's stabilizing. Our next most robust form of subsidy, [ORGANIZATION], has also been dropping and right now has a little less favor in [ORGANIZATION]."
04_29_2015,homeless,"So we're not as optimistic about that. And then a couple more specialized sources, housing opportunities for people with AIDS,  and the Emergency Solutions Grant, which is directed specifically for homeless interventions. You three probably know more about the prospects that we have in [ORGANIZATION] than I do, so we'll leave it at that."
04_29_2015,affordable housing,"For funds available for the development of affordable housing as currently projected both by [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]. Okay, so it includes recent decisions by council As you see various districts tail off that's generally just the end of the district Although a lot of times we have you know downtown waterfront ended [ORGANIZATION] and  We had a recent loan come back in, so we've actually got a little pot of money there. Even though that district is closed, we can continue to spend the proceeds specifically for affordable housing in that urban renewal area."
04_29_2015,homelessness,"I think that just makes sense to most people. Two other minor things. In page 96 on the homelessness expenditures, just a quick primer, what is the difference between direct and indirect expenditures?"
04_29_2015,affordable housing,"And because this is such a valuable education tool, I would urge you to consider a definitions page early on. Yeah, that's a good idea. To just in plain English tell your story so that people then, as they read it, know what we mean by affordable housing or...  tax increment of finance or whatever, regulated unit, just the basic information."
04_29_2015,affordable housing,"Because I think this is going to have an amazing, a tremendous impact on raising public awareness and understanding. And then finally, I hesitate to open up this scab, but there's another equity piece that we don't really get to here, which is the region. We're half the population of the region and two-thirds of the affordable housing, and that's not sustainable yet."
04_29_2015,homeless,"And his house was foreclosed on in [ORGANIZATION], and my mom and I were made homeless. I had gone to [ORGANIZATION] to study a master's and moved back in [LOCATION], which is when I kind of came onto your radar, as we were looking for houses. So housing and jobs  you know the the kind of idea that an education will help you to pull yourself up and to stabilize your family are very um out of reach i appreciate this report as i've said before i also very much appreciate the work of [ORGANIZATION] in leading this data it's very important"
04_29_2015,homelessness,"You're still implementing other plans. They're working. We need to have 1,000-plus people on the streets that will rotate and not end up becoming chronic homelessness."
04_29_2015,homeless,"So, [ORGANIZATION], you will be greatly missed, and thank you for your service. commissioner [PERSON] as your as the housing commissioner you've made transparency and accountability a hallmark and you have been focused on making sure we have good data and that helps us make wiser decisions so thank you for your passion for this this exercise and this report which i think is going to be very helpful to us as we make decisions going forward and then finally  What this report tells us is that if you are formerly homeless, working class, lower middle class, you can't afford to live in the city, and that's not the city that we want. And that has cascading effects, including eroding the base of our public schools, creating divisions, and ultimately, as PERSON2 often says, leading us down the path to some cities that we don't want to emulate, cities of just rich and poor."
04_29_2015,affordable housing,"And it's not [ORGANIZATION] you find a bureau where sort of everybody –  is pulling in the same direction. And it helps that it's a small bureau, but it's also highly motivated and highly qualified people working there. This report provides a pretty clear picture of the need to increase the affordable housing stock throughout the city and also recognizes that our main source of affordable housing funding right now, urban renewal or tax increment funding, is nearing the end of its useful life."
05_09_2018,homeless,"I no longer feel safe in our city and I am no longer proud to be a Portlander because of the condition of our downtown streets and sidewalks. DATE0, I was assaulted on my [STREET] to work at [ORGANIZATION] Clay [STREET]. Out of nowhere and unprovoked, a homeless man approached my car, reached in through my window, and grabbed me by my hair."
05_09_2018,panhandler,"Terrified, I had no other option than to step on the gas to get away from him, losing a handful of hair in the process. ""  This has left me nervous to [ORGANIZATION]. During my wedding reception in [LOCATION], a panhandler spit on one of our out-of-town guests because our friends wouldn't give this person money."
05_09_2018,homelessness,"We serve the transportation needs of this city with the fear that our inadequate insurance protections could push us into poverty or homelessness in the event of an accident. We need a voice because we have no recourse in the event of an unfair deactivation or other grievance we might have with a company. The [ORGANIZATION] are judge, jury, and executioner, and us drivers have no ability to hold them accountable for their actions."
05_09_2018,homeless,"One of my favorite local nonprofits. They provide homeless youth services.  with a creative outlet and technological training. They learn how to make movies from start to finish, and I believe they are here to support or celebrate this proclamation."
05_09_2018,homeless,"Help the people that are homeless right now. That's our biggest issue. Building, yes, we are pro-building, but we cannot stop."
05_09_2018,affordable housing,"That includes everything from [ORGANIZATION], that has become a really key anchor, for the community to FAC0, which is an affordable housing project, within the community to FAC1, which is a historic commercial building. Thank you.  very close by to ORG1 offices at [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]. Clearly, there's also a pipeline for ongoing opportunity and additional placement of the remaining tax increment resources that we committed, and that ranges from [PERSON] to we own the old fire station over on FAC5, and we also own [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]."
05_09_2018,affordable housing,"And then the last goal is our district livability goal, which really focused on kind of the cultural, the historic and kind of the community development aspects  of [ORGANIZATION]. We're happy to state that we've placed about $800,000 worth of community livability grants in the district, and that has supported anything from [ORGANIZATION] that helps affordable housing residents seek a path to self-sufficiency through employment, all the [STREET] to supporting ORG1 redevelopment of property that they're purchasing. Thank you.  at FAC1, that they're actually looking to put into a permanent gallery space that celebrates [ORGANIZATION]'s Chinatown, its past, its presence, and its future."
05_09_2018,affordable housing,"And the city, as I recall, bought an extra floor to make sure there was some affordable housing on that site. So now to have an opportunity to build out the rest of the site is very exciting. So I'm very pleased to support this."
05_09_2018,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] is the executive director of [ORGANIZATION], or [ORGANIZATION], a [ORGANIZATION] nonprofit that manages a portfolio of over 700 units of affordable housing and focuses on helping low-income families achieve stability and self-sufficiency. [PERSON], sorry [PERSON], I'm not sure how to say your last name. I'm going to say [ORGANIZATION]."
05_09_2018,affordable housing,"In the next slide, you'll see a deeper look at affordable housing set-aside expenditures, which I'll remind the public while the affordable housing resources, the [ORGANIZATION] portion of it shows up on our books. [ORGANIZATION] does direct, along with [ORGANIZATION], those investments and the stewardship of those resources. But a deeper look at affordable housing set-aside expenditures show that [ORGANIZATION] is projected to invest more  $158 million of new [ORGANIZATION] resources in active urban renewal areas [ORGANIZATION], with an additional $135 million in programmed resources through the life of the urban renewal areas."
05_09_2018,affordable housing,"The timing of the projects is what is impacting that number. In total, there's about $540 million that's projected to be spent [ORGANIZATION] and the life of the districts. As you well know to date, this has created 4,543 units of new or preserved affordable housing, and currently there are another 1,300 units in production."
05_09_2018,affordable housing,"Along FAC0, our investments have been primarily in small businesses, also as [ORGANIZATION] looks at improvements along the FAC0 couplet. We are also working actively with ORG1 on a property at FAC1 and FAC2 that's right next to the new park that is just completing construction. It will be an affordable housing together with market rate housing and commercial."
05_09_2018,affordable housing,development that's a partnership with both affordable housing and market rate developers. And then the second area that we're seeing a lot of interest amongst the community as well as the development community is at FAC0. There are joint property owners between the private sector and [ORGANIZATION] who's very interested in redevelopment of a 10-acre site out there.
05_09_2018,homelessness,"We have to move forward. The question is how do we do it and how do we minimize the fiscal impact on people who own and people who lease the properties that we're discussing. I've made no secret that some of my priorities as mayor include housing and homelessness, and I want to do everything in my power to ensure that whatever policy comes forward is intentional and well thought out and does the best that it can to preserve housing and avoid displacement and maintain affordability."
05_09_2018,affordable housing,"More than 85% are commercial buildings, offices, warehouses, retail. And there are also about 7,200 residential units in [LOCATION]. About 1,800 of these are publicly financed affordable housing."
05_09_2018,affordable housing,"So we designed a process that started with a technical committee that was charged with providing recommendations on retrofit standards, then a support committee to develop financial options, and finally a policy committee that was intended as a sort of conference committee that would knit together the recommendations of both groups into a coherent program to address this issue. The policy committee included members of both the financial and technical committees, as well as stakeholders representing schools, churches, affordable housing, and historic preservation interests. The committee was intended to meet for [ORGANIZATION], but ended up meeting for [LOCATION]."
05_09_2018,affordable housing,"And again, a reason we owe a special debt of gratitude to these volunteers, who worked on a consensus basis to make their recommendations. They organized their own subcommittees on affordable housing and not-for-profits and historic buildings, and they hosted open house events for both tenants and building owners, and they invited and received a great deal of public testimony at every meeting. Their work also generated significant media interest, and staff took the committee's work on the [STREET], presenting at more than 20 different community venues."
05_09_2018,affordable housing,"The other was that the committee really struggled with this balance of public safety and financial impact. And we spent a lot of time on it. And I think we got to a pretty good consensus about  We did spend some time in that period also talking about affordable housing, the city's commitment to affordable housing and the fact that it houses many of our most vulnerable residents."
05_09_2018,affordable housing,We talked about extending time for retrofits for affordable housing and concluded not to do that. But two members of the committee...  [ORGANIZATION] from [ORGANIZATION] and PERSON1 from ORG1 did commit to the committee that ORG2 could look at what the requirements would be to address that housing stock and what would happen over time with the resources reasonably available. So I'm hopeful they'll come forward with that.
05_09_2018,housing crisis; affordable housing,"So here are my amendments. Thank you. Fish Amendment No. 1 adds a new whereas at the end of the whereas, and it states as follows, quote, whereas the city of [ORGANIZATION] is experiencing a housing crisis and therefore has an interest in ensuring that all options to preserve affordability have been explored, especially in [ORGANIZATION] buildings where public dollars have been invested to guarantee long-term affordable housing."
05_09_2018,affordable housing,"My greatest concern are the unintended consequences of a mandatory program for both the city and the property owner. From the city's standpoint, the unintended consequences range from proposed mandatory provisions conflicting with other city policies, such as affordable housing and workspaces, and policies that...  are meant to preserve and strengthen the cultural and economic vitality of existing neighborhoods. It is quite likely that a mandatory program could lead to a significant number of buildings being transferred to the hands of developers, possibly leading to increased demolition and decreased ownership of local buildings."
05_09_2018,affordable housing,"I ask you to slow this process down, which you are doing. Acknowledge that most of these buildings meet current code or don't because of a system error and ease the minds, hearts, and threat to livelihood of the owners of our unique and interesting one- to three-story brick buildings. By the [STREET], I'm sure you know developers are already making low-ball offers to beleaguered property owners who are afraid to lose their livelihood and or their affordable housing."
05_09_2018,homeless; homelessness,"I've lived in [ORGANIZATION] since [ORGANIZATION]. To avoid homelessness in [LOCATION], our family moved into my grandparents' chicken coop for [DATE] to not be homeless. We were a poor family."
05_09_2018,homeless,"I'm retired, and I live on a fixed income. And my main concern is if you implement...  the measures on the three or four buildings, I'm going to be homeless. I mean, this is going to have a broad effect on a lot of people."
05_09_2018,affordable housing,"During this time of intense focus on building our affordable housing inventory, it is baffling to me that you would consider adopting such a nuclear option on our inventory of the more affordable units in our city, those being the older properties of historic nature. Let me address my particular situation with you. I own and have been the steward for [ORGANIZATION] of an elegant [LOCATION] building on the corner of Northwest 22nd [STREET] and [ORGANIZATION], just off FAC0."
05_09_2018,homelessness; housing crisis; affordable housing,"This resolution will negatively impact thousands of people, building owners, small businesses, and those who live in apartments, many of which are considered to be affordable housing. I thought we were supposed to be at a housing crisis, and yet if this ordinance is enacted, it could literally put thousands of people at risk of homelessness, as described by one of the earlier people that testified. Entire main streets and neighborhoods could be decimated as a result of this act."
05_09_2018,homeless,"I've seen homeless people just hang out there day and night. It's going to get worse unless there is tremendous backing from you to help the small business owners. And it has to be across the board, schools, tenants, everything."
05_09_2018,homelessness,"Thank you. As an owner of a [ORGANIZATION] and as a founder of [ORGANIZATION], working in housing and homelessness issues, I want to be very clear, no one wants unsafe buildings, as we've talked about. However, this mandate was created unfairly without representation of small owners such as myself, condo owners, artists, and other stakeholders."
05_09_2018,homelessness; affordable housing,"we have listened here lots of technocrats speaking about technical sides of things of earthquakes and how buildings respond to the earthquakes but we do not, the city has not asked for the study or considered the study of what is going to happen to the people and what are the people's responses to  not just disaster, but to the conflict, because this is going to create conflict. And there is a conflict already in [ORGANIZATION] with rising rents, homelessness, non-affordable housing, and so forth. Conflict rises,  primarily from perceived or real inequality."
05_09_2018,homelessness,"From these perceived or real inequality, there is a rising of a social conflict and it's not just homelessness and mental health issues, it's people who are dissatisfied with what is going on in the city. So I would like to urge the city consider the role  Taking the perspective that in conflict, when there is earthquake, when there are natural disasters, people band together. When there is a conflict that is caused by this inequality, it's more conflict that there is violence."
06_04_2015,homeless,"On [ORGANIZATION], the mayor has issued a proclamation, and it's my honor to read it. Whereas after [PERSON] of training in ministry, Dr. [PERSON] was named senior pastor of [ORGANIZATION] in [DATE]. And whereas Dr. [PERSON] formed the nonprofit [ORGANIZATION],  to serve distressed [ORGANIZATION] communities with programs including youth ministries, a 12-step substance abuse recovery program, a prison ministry, homeless shelters and more."
06_04_2015,homeless,"This is a complicated problem. We can't seem to find a solution. We work so hard at housing, and there's still homeless people."
04_25_2018,homeless,"So it's been [TIME]. Here is the issue, and it was kind of serendipitous that this came to me because I was talking to these three gentlemen about it. [ORGANIZATION] did a piece on [ORGANIZATION]'s homeless population."
04_25_2018,homeless,"But I do want to make the argument about that. And just for self-identification, I'm a person who is a recovering alcoholic, recovering addict, recovering recipient of your criminal justice system, and have lived with the diagnosis of schizophrenia for [ORGANIZATION] and a four-time suicide survivor. Here's the thing, when I was looking at this article talking about this issue, [ORGANIZATION] is quoted saying this, first thing you want to do is stabilize the homeless"
04_25_2018,homeless,"and then you can start to make long-term plans. And then after that he goes on to say that, [ORGANIZATION] says investing in permanent housing isn't a practical solution right now because what you need to do first is to stabilize the homeless. And having been a person who has been homeless in transitional housing and shelters,  and living in FAC0 motels."
04_25_2018,affordable housing,"Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding impediments to affordable housing. Welcome, [PERSON]. Do you have a [ORGANIZATION]?"
04_25_2018,affordable housing,Thank you. So it's a four to one base. There's a one to one affordable housing bonus.
04_25_2018,affordable housing,So the reason I'm here is  The reason I'm here is to talk about who's providing that feedback to affordable housing developers that they can't use the zoning that council is giving them. The first proposal came in for 164 affordable units. 49 were deeply affordable for seniors.
04_25_2018,affordable housing,This is the best quote. So first one was Commissioner [PERSON] asking whether we want to subject these people to the indignity of living in an inferior building and cramming people in. And then Commissioner [PERSON] chuckling as she says that affordable housing isn't within the [ORGANIZATION]'s purview.
04_25_2018,affordable housing,"But by then, the damage has been done. We have a nonprofit who wants to build hundreds of affordable units in our neighborhoods, and [ORGANIZATION] is taking this extremely protective, myopic view that doesn't consider the value that affordable housing would bring to the city. Thank you."
04_25_2018,affordable housing,"They're more than happy to talk about parking and loading zones, which aren't really in their purview either. They just don't want to talk about affordable housing because I guess they don't like that. Thanks."
04_25_2018,affordable housing,"And I didn't put that number out there in order to mislead or alarm. I don't know. I think, for example, when people come and testify before us and say there's 100 units in an affordable housing development, the total cost is X, they do the math."
04_25_2018,affordable housing,Thanks. Commissioner [PERSON] from [ORGANIZATION]. We're the affordable housing developer behind this proposal.
04_25_2018,affordable housing,"Quick note on process. We submitted this proposal in [ORGANIZATION], under the [ORGANIZATION] refinement project. That project was set up, I believe, to facilitate development of affordable housing."
04_25_2018,affordable housing,"One, they failed to acknowledge that our proposal was an affordable housing development, and that was confirmed to me by [ORGANIZATION] staff. Secondly, it was silent on our request to deal with the zoning on the FAC0 proper. So based on that error, which we communicated to [ORGANIZATION] and to staff, we asked for an amendment to correct what we felt was a mistake in the record."
04_25_2018,affordable housing,"We want to be good neighbors. We're committed to good opportunities for affordable housing, but we wanted all these things to work together and appreciate you creating this process and giving us the opportunity. Thanks."
04_25_2018,housing crisis,"Hi, my name is [ORGANIZATION]. I live at [DATE] Northeast Mallory, which is three doors down from the proposed parking lot site and two doors down from now the [PERSON] residence who is asking for commercial or [ORGANIZATION]'s new amendment to include their lot as well. I first and foremost want to say that as a long-time [ORGANIZATION] resident and a nurse, I understand the housing crisis."
04_25_2018,affordable housing,"I think that this is an urgent need, and I am glad to hear that [ORGANIZATION]  going to build affordable housing. What I oppose is the scale. I oppose the spot zoning."
04_25_2018,affordable housing,We would love to see affordable housing built on that lot. It is important and we welcome this. But we think that the scale commercial zoning will allow is [STREET] too big for a residential neighborhood.
04_25_2018,affordable housing,"Similarly, the local infrastructure, which includes narrow 24-foot roads, is not designed to handle the density that a mixed-use apartment building of that size would bring. On the other hand, with R1 zoning, we could have a smaller residential building that can be constructed that's in harmony with the neighborhood and still provide the much-needed affordable housing that this developer says he wants to create. For the record, I also want to state how deeply disappointed I am in this city and in this developer for a complete absence of community outreach and engagement."
04_25_2018,affordable housing,We feel it's too big. We firmly believe that affordable housing is really important and would welcome [ORGANIZATION] proposition to make it our one. That seems very reasonable to us.
04_25_2018,affordable housing,"Um...  I can see FAC0 directly from my kitchen window. If a five-story building went in on the parking lot, I would be able to see it over the top of the house behind me, which is already [DATE] stories tall. I completely support affordable housing."
04_25_2018,affordable housing,"The vast majority of that development has not been in line with my values. I support affordable housing on the FAC0 lot, and I want to be very clear about that. I do not support [ORGANIZATION] for the fact that it is too large and out of scale for the neighborhood."
04_25_2018,affordable housing,"I'll be parking blocks away trying to tote my dogs and babies and groceries to try to get back to my house. So I want to say that I absolutely understand and support the need for development and affordable housing, but I would just like to see it done to scale with our neighborhood. If he wasn't under doctor's orders, my husband would be here as well, so I came to represent him too, but his family for generations has been a strong proponent of development in [ORGANIZATION]."
04_25_2018,affordable housing,"First of all, I want to thank everyone for coming [ORGANIZATION] and giving your testimony. If this wasn't my job, I know I'd have a hard time coming downtown in the middle of a DATE1, and so it's always appreciated. I'm...  heartened to hear that most or almost all of you support affordable housing, but I need you to understand that very few neighborhoods want it in their neighborhoods."
05_27_2020,affordable housing,"Amend planning and zoning code, the comprehensive plan map, and the zoning map to implement the expanding opportunities for affordable housing project. Colleagues, we continue [ORGANIZATION] hearing on a proposal to expand opportunities for affordable housing from [ORGANIZATION]. ORG1 staff, of course, are here to present the package of amendments we agreed upon [LOCATION], including one code amendment."
05_27_2020,affordable housing,"The first one was the code amendment around affordability amendments. And as you recall, this amendment request was to require that projects taking advantage of the conditional use exemption be regulated affordable housing by aligning the language with [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] waiver program. The draft code language was developed in collaboration with ORG1 staff and [ORGANIZATION] staff, so I want to thank them for their help with that."
05_27_2020,affordable housing,"So talk about how that is consistent with our goal of adding to the pool of affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]. Essentially, it's the same as what's going to result from any of these map changes, which will require affordability now whenever there's development on maps. these faith-owned properties."
05_27_2020,affordable housing,Is that what you mean? I guess I'm hearing something different [ORGANIZATION] than I heard before. I thought that the whole reason why we were bringing this whole proposal forward was the desire for some institutions to be able to build affordable housing.
02_26_2020,homeless,"Same to my colleagues, thank you for your patience. First up is communications, [ORGANIZATION]. Item 158, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding the homeless camping, drug sales, and use prostitution."
02_26_2020,houseless,"Being houseless, however, is not a crime. It is a situation. And so I just wanted to correct that misperception that somehow we're not allowing police officers to police the city of [ORGANIZATION]."
02_26_2020,homelessness,"Item 159, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding homelessness and its effect on the neighborhood. Is [PERSON] here? Next, please."
02_26_2020,homeless,"Item 160, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding housing first and propose a viable alternative solution to the homeless crisis called elevator economics theory. Too bad. I was too."
02_26_2020,homeless,"As of right now, there is a population of constituents and residents that are unable to file for protection orders because they do not meet the criteria. These criteria center around domestic partnership and committed partnership. This population includes the homeless who are living on the streets being subjected to abuse."
02_26_2020,houseless,"Thank you. And I believe that 162, please. Request of [ORGANIZATION] to [ORGANIZATION] regarding houseless pod village on FAC0 in [ORGANIZATION]."
02_26_2020,homeless,"DATE0, I am here to speak to you about a concern I have and a group of residents that includes renters, landlords, business owners, and property owners about the possibility of the village pods for homeless people on FAC0 in [ORGANIZATION]. The group I joined is called [ORGANIZATION]. We meet DATE1 as an open forum."
02_26_2020,houseless,"So much for the kindness of the heart for our houseless people. There were several community meetings, both at the church and [ORGANIZATION]. These meetings became unruly and contentious at best."
02_26_2020,homeless,"And so my question to you is, why do you believe the city has a role in that? Well, because your homeless group headed up by [ORGANIZATION] has been at the forefront to some of the so-called community meetings supporting the idea of putting this village pod together. on FAC0."
02_26_2020,homeless,So that means it's probably not going to be $8 million a year. It's probably going to be more like $5 million a year if you're trying to entice people to move over to this natural gas. So how much over the time and what could be done with that money to like benefit the homeless who have a lack of bathrooms?
02_26_2020,homeless,"I think of the chain link fencing around FAC0 where there's 36 bathrooms in there on the men and women's side and there's chain link fencing and there's all those homeless people in tents out there. So and I also wanted to talk about you know [[ORGANIZATION]ERSON] used to send their scrubbed waste to [[ORGANIZATION]ERSON] to put on their [ORGANIZATION] wheat. I mean why can't we have you know in these outlying areas where people are you know more into using composting toilets, why can't we send the [ORGANIZATION] to the alfalfa fields, which is what they say it could be used for."
05_24_2018,affordable housing,And I wanted to reiterate what [ORGANIZATION] we are asking [ORGANIZATION] to do. There are two things that we're asking [ORGANIZATION] to do. One is to exempt affordable housing units from the multimodal incentive within the commercial mixed-use zones.
05_24_2018,affordable housing,"What I wanted to reiterate is that what we're not asking [ORGANIZATION] to do [ORGANIZATION] is to.  amend the zoning code or to take new action on policy aside from the waiver of affordable housing. [PERSON] already took that action in [LOCATION] as part of the update to the comprehensive plan and the transportation system plan. [PERSON] unanimously approved  changes to require transportation demand management actions in the commercial mixed-use zone for developments that are of 10 units or more that are within what we define as frequent service to transit, which is a [TIME] line."
05_24_2018,affordable housing,"However, as staff worked through and worked with other bureaus on implementation, concerns were raised around the impact of affordable housing. So therefore, we're proposing a separate rate for the multimodal incentive fee for affordable units in the transportation fee schedule, and then to exempt those units from the multimodal incentive fee for [ORGANIZATION] through [LOCATION]. So again, just to sum up why we're here DATE2 and bringing this one piece of the implementation package to you, the current transportation fee schedule does not include the multimodal incentive fee component."
05_24_2018,affordable housing,"So we need to amend that schedule to include the multimodal incentive fees for market rate and affordable units. And then the second component is providing this exemption for affordable units only.  to the multimodal incentive fee element for [ORGANIZATION] through [LOCATION]. And then finally, we are bringing this as an emergency DATE2 because we need this exemption for affordable housing and these lines in the transportation fee schedule to be in [STREET] as the comprehensive plan is enacted [TIME]."
05_24_2018,affordable housing,"But I put these forward as amendments that I hope you will see as strengthening the commitment around affordable housing. But I'll let the chips fall where the chips might. So the first amendment I'd like to propose would be a Section D under the Section 2.  D, there is a 2C currently."
05_24_2018,affordable housing,"We want to make sure that we balance the production of the affordable housing without cost burdening our partners or  with ensuring that tenants of affordable units receive the same transportation benefits as tenants of market rate units. In other words, this is a study. It's geared towards..."
05_24_2018,affordable housing,"I would say, of course, the [ORGANIZATION] is concerned about the cost of affordable housing, as you are, would reflect that. In some ways, the dollar will go further with residents of affordable units because they are, in general, less likely to own automobiles. They will often also be eligible for ORG1 low fare programs."
05_24_2018,affordable housing,"And number four, other technical and policy related map changes as appropriate. For example, changes to facilitate affordable housing and address city bureau coordination, overlay zone corrections, recently identified nonconforming commercial uses, and additional split zones. You held a public hearing on this project on [ORGANIZATION]."
05_24_2018,affordable housing,"So in other words, we have double the capacity in this new map that [ORGANIZATION] assigns to us. Who this housing benefits, through what means and ends, is the crucial part of this conversation, which we will continue in the context of the residential infill project and on various different development projects. It's essential that we focus our efforts on affordable housing options and commercial options that serve all Portlanders, particularly those who are low income and at risk of displacement or further displacement."
05_24_2018,affordable housing,"The affordable housing bonus is required to be used if the bonus height is used. It also increases the base floor area ratio to 9 to 1 on the full block if all floors above the ground floor on the western one half of the block are in a residential use. This amendment also increases the base height...  on the four northern blocks of the new Chinatown-Japantown historic district to 200 feet, which is still a reduction to height on these blocks that exist [ORGANIZATION]."
05_24_2018,affordable housing,"And I'm offering these amendments because I do believe, as whenever I offered it before, that the couple things, one is that what sways me to go from 160 to 200 feet is the extra affordable housing that we will get on Block 33. And finally, I just believe we need to infuse [ORGANIZATION] with activity, and there is none there now. We need people that live there as well as work there."
05_24_2018,affordable housing,"Now, knowing that three of the [ORGANIZATION] have decided to approve this, I looked into can we do something in the zoning code to protect [ORGANIZATION], and I believe the answer is no. When we're talking about affordable housing, we're going to get affordable housing if there is residential development anyway. And what [PERSON] has been on record is saying that they don't need more affordable housing."
05_24_2018,affordable housing,"We are now near the end of the development cycle. That is broadly accepted. I believe with 200 feet, based on what I understand to be the process, and I'm going to ask a few follow-up questions in a moment, there is not a substantial difference in terms of impact there,  yet there is potentially a significant difference in terms of affordable housing opportunities, as well as housing generally in this area where currently people could build higher to the north and there is nothing built on FAC0."
05_24_2018,affordable housing,"And businesses are struggling, and they can certainly use more housing. Secondly, I would think that anyone who's remotely familiar with my position on housing would never think that  that the argument that we don't need affordable housing would fly with me. I frankly find that offensive."
05_24_2018,affordable housing,"Market rate housing is affordable to people earning 120% or more of median income. And when we're talking about affordable housing in regards to inclusionary zoning, we're talking about housing that's affordable to people at 60 and 80 percent of MFI, median family income. And those are many people who do vital work in our city and are not somehow less desirable neighbors than those that can afford market-rate rents."
05_24_2018,affordable housing,"We count among our clients individuals, local and national developers, affordable housing agencies, as well as local, state, and federal governments. I FOUNDED HERITAGE IN DATE0. FOR [ORGANIZATION] TOWN."
05_24_2018,affordable housing,"While I am very pleased and grateful that this council has made clear that whatever our decision, any future height increases will be linked to a bonus for affordable housing, and I think that was very important. And frankly, I compliment staff for having crafted that mechanism because we essentially imported something that didn't really apply to a historic district from outside the district. And so regardless of the outcome of this vote,  We have ensured that there will be some affordable housing."
05_24_2018,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] would be a tremendous amenity for our growing neighborhood. While FAC0 has long been a major business district, [ORGANIZATION] have seen us transforming into one of the city's most accessible places to live. We currently have hundreds of residential units under construction, including [ORGANIZATION] 12-story affordable housing development and many more developments in the planning stage."
04_18_2018,housing crisis,"Thank you. PERSON0, would you please read [ORGANIZATION] 358? Request of PERSON1 to address [ORGANIZATION] regarding the housing crisis."
04_18_2018,affordable housing,"Is Ms. [PERSON] here? Okay, let's do [ORGANIZATION]. Request of PERSON1 to address [ORGANIZATION] to request the ORG1 vacate a strip of land at 84 [LOCATION] to allow more affordable housing units."
04_18_2018,homelessness,"[TIME], moving back to what I was just talking about, there was a lot of people came with signs that said, care, not cops. and I would suggest that that's a false dichotomy, that we don't have to choose one or the other, that we can find funding for the things that are important and that we need to provide funding for positive things at the same time that we're addressing some of the most crucial issues in our community, like homelessness, unaffordable rents, and community policing. So thank you all for being here."
04_18_2018,affordable housing,"Each ORG1-application, as you know, has to come before [ORGANIZATION] for approval. In addition to the [ORGANIZATION] tax exemption provided by the ORG1, this project will also receive an exemption of the affordable housing construction excise tax that otherwise would have been due on the affordable units. This project will join the other 19 private sector projects in the inclusionary housing permit approval pipeline, making a minimum of 92 units affordable in otherwise market rate developments."
04_18_2018,affordable housing,"Well, again, thanks to Commissioner [PERSON] for his work getting this inclusionary housing allowed at the legislature. This one works out to be $567 that the taxpayers will be foregoing in order to have each affordable housing unit, which is obviously a very inexpensive [STREET] of providing some support for people needing housing at 80% of their average median income. PERSON1."
03_18_2015,houseless,"Okay, so let's take communications items first, please number 274. I  274, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel regarding right to survive houseless issues. PERSON1?"
03_18_2015,homeless; houseless,Okay. Let's try the next one. Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel regarding homeless houseless issues.
03_18_2015,houseless,Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel regarding houseless issues. I'm seeing [PERSON] here. Is [PERSON] here?
03_18_2015,homeless,"Mayor [PERSON], could I speak about the homeless? Not now. You've got to stay on the agenda."
03_18_2015,homeless,"You need to look at the ability of the president of the council and the mayor to –  improve, to be less exclusive, and also to improve the situation we have in [TIME] with public comment so that people who have been in the audience at 9.30 might be able to make more spontaneous remarks to some of the serious issues that are facing the city. But as to this particular agreement, or not agreement, but change into our city's structuring of how we...  It's hard to say how we protect the image of a city that has homeless people sleeping underneath the sign. So I think we'll have to also talk about where that revenue goes, that it doesn't just cover administrative costs."
05_03_2017,affordable housing,"We did look at it as to could it be used for affordable housing, could it be used for the navigation centre. Neither PERSON0 or the director of [ORGANIZATION] was interested in that. And we just can't, we don't have the $10 million."
05_03_2017,houseless,"What is sanctuary really? I will go now back to...  deep into the roots of my family while you decide if you will fire the Nazi cops on our police force or continue to hand out the free pass of oppression and terror over us, the Jews, the blacks, the houseless, the poor, the oppressed under your current rule. So $4 million to parking lots, to security for parking lots, a private parking lot firm as far as I know."
05_03_2017,houseless,"I believe that $4 million sounds a bit excessive. In the past, like [ORGANIZATION] said, [PERSON] died in a parking garage in downtown [ORGANIZATION] and I would hope that if you're  trying to spend more on security, that you would be able to use that security to make sure that some of our houseless members who are seeking refuge or warm places in these parking garages  aren't used to brutalize them and to exclude them from these public spaces because I don't find it acceptable that people are dying on our streets and you're wanting to spend $4 million more over DATE0 DATE1 on added security measures. It just doesn't sound plausible or humane is actually the better word for it."
05_03_2017,houseless,"I'd like to see, since it's city-owned and since we're talking about the allocation of city funds, I want to see a full budget justification for this request. I want to know why $4 million is the number. And not only that, exactly where would you like houseless people to go?"
05_03_2017,houseless,"And [ORGANIZATION] that I come here, I hear millions for this and millions for that and this and that. And I don't hear anybody talking about allocating funds to uplift black communities or allocating funds to take care of people that are houseless. The hell is wrong with you people?"
05_03_2017,houseless,more money for the freaking cops. Who do you think you're kidding? So you can target houseless people and people of color.
05_03_2017,homeless,"You should sell all these parking structures off. Take the money back, as some people said. Put it into the...  building more housing for the homeless, and or you must reserve the right to redevelop these pieces of well-located properties and also build apartments up above."
05_03_2017,houseless,"And what isn't being addressed is our houseless community in [ORGANIZATION]. I mean, I know people get tired of me coming here and talking about the houseless community, but they're everywhere. And we have to care about it, not sweep them up, not put paving pothole roads in front of living people and their animals in our houseless communities in our park, in [ORGANIZATION]."
05_03_2017,houseless,"There's people who live in [ORGANIZATION] and should have homes. And instead of having homes, we've created one, two, I don't know, five, seven, maybe ten different new apartment structures for people who have money, who have never lived in [LOCATION], who are now all in [LOCATION], in [ORGANIZATION], really not...  being a part of our community at all, wishing that people in the houseless community would just go away when we tried to bring in housing for them. I mean, this thing, it comes back to gentrification."
05_03_2017,houseless,"You pick it, where you live. We have to take care of the houseless. And I would like to see attention from my community in [ORGANIZATION] instead of just my, my, my, my, my for our poor [STREET].  which we can't walk down, what about coming here and talking about our houses community and dealing with homes there?"
05_03_2017,houseless,"I mean, I haven't forgotten the snowstorm and the absolute ultimate failure of [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]. And their inability to...  preemptive strike or even follow through with anything comprehensive that will lead to the city being able to function on a healthier level. But this sounds more to me like a bunch of white people in [ORGANIZATION] are upset that houseless people and people of color and other vulnerable community members are there."
05_03_2017,houseless,"People that you conveniently leave out of these conversations, even though they do a lot more community work than you do. This is just to sweep out houseless people. Because a bunch of white people don't like how their sidewalk looks."
05_03_2017,affordable housing,"In partnership with our local tech community, we aspire to collect and release data that will decrease congestion, increase transit ridership, and active transportation opportunities. This open data program will not just benefit our transportation plans, but a host of city services from affordable housing placement to enhancing our emergency medical response system. So I want to thank all the bureaus involved in the effort, as well as you, Mayor, for your leadership in bringing this forward [ORGANIZATION]."
05_03_2017,homeless,"It's using predictive analytics. And that's where in [ORGANIZATION], officials there turned a terrible fire tragedy in that city into a better service for all citizens by creating a model that helps firefighters identify which homes are most at risk of having a non-functioning smoke detector and contacting the homes in those areas to offer a free installation. It's using performance-based contracting, where in [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], that city is using this approach to more actively manage their homeless services contracts."
05_03_2017,homeless; homelessness,"And I think that what citizens and what government would want to see is  something that's visual, something that's easy to use, something that has an applied type of insight toward big issues that people are thinking about and has that opportunity to build what we think of as integration or these synapses of points of connections between bureaus and departments  For example, we worked with [ORGANIZATION] to take their state of housing report and make it something that you can understand visually, interact with, it's empathetic, but that we also added new data to that. And we were looking at pulling historic...  voter registration to see where people had been living and where people had actually been moving so we can understand a little bit more about what's happening in the city. We worked also with [ORGANIZATION], and perhaps we weren't able to bring a lot of new data there, but we were able to take the data they did have that was in a form that was difficult to understand, full of things that you can't share with the public because of privacy concerns, and take the story for everybody who has been working remotely  with homelessness and make that something that the public can engage with a little bit more."
05_03_2017,homelessness,It turned out that the audience award at [DATE] was for the presentation that related to [ORGANIZATION]. And there was some astonishing data that they came up with on [ORGANIZATION]. But I was also really taken by some of the findings and some of the reporting around homelessness.
05_03_2017,homeless,"And I think someone was, like,  One of the cops were putting tear gas everywhere, and I saw them running after homeless people and stuff and trying to hurt them. How did you feel? I felt scared, and I don't like the cops."
05_03_2017,homelessness,"And so you can imagine what a kick I got out of it because I'm always crying about bunk beds. And my large-scale bunk housing, my argument goes deeper than that. Beyond homelessness and gentrification, it's about the concept of shared space as it decreases with development."
05_03_2017,affordable housing,"We saw DATE0 in the items we discussed so far how you can have the information that's clearly written on the time certain and on the consent agenda about this is what this is and this is what we're doing. We're soliciting for our bids or we are building a bid.  low-cost affordable housing, and still people have questions, concerns, and they're going to need real people to be able to answer the phone, answer to the email, and explain things. Because a lot of what we do is very complicated."
05_03_2017,affordable housing,"for all of the incredible and important work that they do in this community. I'm very much looking forward to the opening of their cultural center in [ORGANIZATION], where they've partnered with [ORGANIZATION] to also bring more affordable housing to the community. I know my staff is working diligently with both [PERSON] and ORG2 to fill the remaining gaps to make this project happen."
05_03_2017,homeless,"So this is of utmost importance to me because we live in a rape culture here in [ORGANIZATION] where sexual assault is almost glorified on a [DATE] basis. And the objectification of marginalized community members, specifically women, women of color, youth, homeless people,  So I agree with [ORGANIZATION] that this database, it needs to be broadened. There needs to be more accountability."
05_03_2017,homeless,"I've had personal friends have been raped. I had a report confidentially told to me from [ORGANIZATION] clear out by the city.  that every individual there, woman, has been raped not just once but twice. And I'm just curious how the police bureau is really accounted for on how they handle these cases because I've known women in that position that wouldn't even talk to the police, especially in homeless conditions, because of the lack of trust, that they would truly be regarded and respected as a woman and what took [STREET]."
05_03_2017,homeless,I think it's a real mark on us and how we perform as citizens to not protect our homeless people better. And I think we can do a lot better. And I think the police really should focus on it as a very important priority.
05_03_2017,affordable housing,"It's not allowed. Even if we had a process to give people units from the pool and make this condition go away, that provision was only intended for these sort of nonprofit, like, visible affordable housing providers, et cetera. The other criteria for the [ORGANIZATION] plan were met or did not apply on an industrial sanctuary or legislative project."
05_23_2018,affordable housing,"and we were all hungry and it's early. And the very first question they asked me, and Commissioner [PERSON], you will appreciate this, the very first question was tell us about your affordable housing strategy."
05_23_2018,homeless,"I want to acknowledge and invite forward our first panel, [ORGANIZATION], Deputy Director of [ORGANIZATION], and [ORGANIZATION] Manager,  We also have [ORGANIZATION], who's the Director of [ORGANIZATION] at Home Forward, who I think is on the second panel, but he's crashing the first panel. So welcome as well. And, PERSON3, take it away."
05_23_2018,homeless,"I'm very proud to introduce the presenters for [ORGANIZATION]. Joining me are [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] Director, who will explain a little bit more about the low-income services that the ORG1 offers and how the multifamily program fits into that suite of services, and [PERSON], the ORG2 Director at ORG3, to walk you through how our agreement connects the Water ORG1 to a trusted and existing program. And then in our second panel, we will hear from [LOCATION] from [ORGANIZATION] on his perspective of how multifamily assistance programs benefits the communities that he serves."
05_23_2018,affordable housing,"Mayor, commissioners, thanks for the opportunity to be here. [ORGANIZATION] is the public housing authority that serves [ORGANIZATION]. We develop, own, and manage affordable housing and run a variety of rent assistance programs, the largest being [ORGANIZATION]."
05_23_2018,homeless; homelessness,"We know that expanding our efforts to keep people from becoming homeless is a critical component of our broader efforts to end homelessness in our community. When we can intervene to prevent eviction, it limits devastating disruptions that families experience when they're displaced or experience homelessness. Preventing eviction enables families to maintain connections at school and at work and in their social networks."
05_23_2018,homelessness,"And we know that it's less expensive than finding new housing once a family is forced into homelessness. We look forward to building this partnership over [ORGANIZATION], working with [ORGANIZATION] and our agency partners to integrate this critical new resource into the existing straw service infrastructure. And we greatly value the leadership of [ORGANIZATION], Commissioner [PERSON], and this council in identifying strategies to protect the most vulnerable utilizers of our public utilities."
05_23_2018,homelessness,"If I had one extra dollar [DATE] left from the budget, I would put it into straw because we've seen the results in preventing people from losing their tenancy, preventing people from falling into homelessness, or rapidly rehousing people, as you've noted. So it's a great program, and we look forward to the partnership. Mayor, I have two other invited guests to bring forward."
05_23_2018,homelessness,"There are many things I love about [ORGANIZATION], but what makes [ORGANIZATION] unique, what sets us apart from other major cities, is our city's ability to take on difficult issues and find innovative solutions. Living wage ordinances, ban the box, investing in our infrastructure, and most recently, I have watched you grapple with homelessness. And [ORGANIZATION]...  You're bringing forward three resolutions that takes on the difficult issues of the evolving [ORGANIZATION] industry."
05_23_2018,homelessness,"Our earnings are erratic and often fall below minimum wage after driver expenses. And between high insurance deductibles, driver safety, and many other issues, the liability and risks that we assume as drivers is significant. These risks can push us into poverty or homelessness in the event of a catastrophic event such as an accident."
05_23_2018,homeless,"You know, we all love each other and do things to help each other. We also are owner-operated, and it started out with the vets from World War II, you know, forming this company. And now we have drivers that are homeless."
05_23_2018,houseless,"My commitment is to...  bring forward effective communication skills to help people have healthier relationships in their lives. The first time I made this jump, soon after I moved to [ORGANIZATION], I fell flat on my face. I ended up houseless."
05_23_2018,houseless,"I was a very privileged houseless person in that I had a minivan, right? I had friends who looked out for me. But outside of that, right now, [ORGANIZATION] is how I am making my life work in terms of having the foundations covered so that [STREET] I can then be the entrepreneur that I need to be, be available for my clients that I'm slowly building, and working.  doing the work that I am here to do in this world and it is my life's demand."
05_23_2018,houseless,"And for me, that's terrifying because I do not wanna end up houseless again. And I have to, once I turned [ORGANIZATION], none of my birthdays really had an impact, but when I turned [ORGANIZATION], I was like, it's now or not. I have to bring my gifts forward."
04_27_2016,homelessness,"If not, then it comes back [ORGANIZATION] in second reading with your follow-up, please. Now let's move on to [LOCATION]. Amend contracts with [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, and ORG3 to add $842,500 in rent assistance for people experiencing homelessness."
04_27_2016,homeless; homelessness,"These funds are  will rapidly expand our providers' resource capacity to assist with permanent housing placement for people experiencing homelessness and eviction prevention for people at imminent risk of becoming homeless. [ORGANIZATION] has already obligated a significant portion of this to our nonprofit service providers under current contracting authority. The ordinance before us now authorizes [PERSON] to dedicate the remainder of this $1 million to fund four high-performing organizations, nonprofits, including ORG2, [PERSON], [LOCATION], and [ORGANIZATION] for immediate use."
04_27_2016,homeless; homelessness,"These funds are a critical component of our safety net, and they will go towards supporting permanent housing placement for more than 150 people currently experiencing homelessness and preventing more than 125 others from becoming homeless. Thank you, and I urge your support. Thank you very much."
04_27_2016,homeless,"My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I'm with [ORGANIZATION], and I deal with the homeless a lot. And I'm all for a program to house the homeless."
04_27_2016,homeless,"The thing is, I would like to... It seems like joining all these organizations have received a lot of money in [ORGANIZATION], and I'd actually like to see where that money's going to. How, you know, is it going to actually house...  150 homeless or is it going to go into some director's pocket?"
04_27_2016,homeless,Thanks. So this is money that's going out the door through those organizations to actual rent assistance to people that need it. So most of the money is actually going directly to pay rent for people that are vulnerable to becoming homeless.
04_27_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"I don't want to repeat all the concerns, so let me just add the concern of subsidized housing units that  that are at risk because of this rezoning. There are several units of subsidized housing in [ORGANIZATION] that are right in the rezoning area that I feel may be lost by any new development that would come in. And at a time when homelessness and affordable housing are such concerns, I would hate to see even more residents of this rich and diverse neighborhood displaced."
04_27_2016,affordable housing,"It actually supports your goal of affordable housing improvement. Secondly, we appreciate the policy amendment to policy 6.457. I think that encourages collaboration between the neighbor groups and [ORGANIZATION]."
04_27_2016,affordable housing,"Yeah. It's all commercial, and in fact, it's not at all. There's many, many residences in there, and it remains a [STREET] of affordable housing options, and we hope that it can change, and then when it develops out, it'll be able to develop in situations that are not just studio apartments."
04_27_2016,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] recently published a set of affordable housing recommendations that includes revising [ORGANIZATION]'s zoning code and zoning map to allow for more missing middle housing types in the city's residential neighborhoods. In many ways, proximity has become the equivalent of opportunity in our city. The closer you are to good schools, active parks, and well-paying jobs, the greater your chances for success."
04_27_2016,affordable housing,"As such, the discussion about affordable housing can't just be about how much housing we have, but where that housing is located. Recent research shows that kids from poor families who lived in mixed-income neighborhoods do better in school and earn more money over their lifetimes than kids who live in neighborhoods of concentrated poverty. At the same time, kids from more affluent families acquire social and emotional skills like curiosity, collaboration, and empathy that help them succeed later in life."
04_27_2016,affordable housing,"The benefits extend to the entire region, allowing a diversity of housing types in our neighborhoods will promote affordability, make our community more walkable, and reduce carbon emissions. And by reducing the need for people to commute long distances from places where housing costs less, mixed-income neighborhoods can reduce traffic congestion and improve movement of freight throughout the region. And the best part about revising the zoning code is that unlike the vast majority of other affordable housing solutions, it doesn't cost a dime."
04_27_2016,housing crisis,"This is just one of many reasons that we're supporting [ORGANIZATION] and their support on amendments and measures including opposing down zones and high opportunity neighborhoods. We're committed to addressing the housing crisis and ensuring that our green city is affordable for all [ORGANIZATION]ers. I'd like to close by thanking Mayor [PERSON] for proposing these amendments and [PERSON] and others at [ORGANIZATION] for their work on policies to reduce carbon emissions, limit fossil fuel infrastructure, reduce local demand for fossil fuels, and build a robust clean energy economy in [ORGANIZATION]."
04_27_2016,affordable housing,"We support [ORGANIZATION], elimination of proposed comprehensive plan change 92. changing zoning on a half-block area to R1. These properties, a 10-unit apartment building, [ORGANIZATION], a duplex, and a quadruplex provide affordable housing."
04_27_2016,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] needs to develop a [ORGANIZATION] mix of economic inducements, incentives, and requirements to engage the housing industry in providing for affordable housing. Lastly, I request, and this is my personal request to protect my own investment in solar panels, I request that [ORGANIZATION] develop a policy protecting existing homeowners' right to sunlight. The policy and implementing codes should affect all forms of new housing in moderate and low-density residential zones, the existing zones."
04_27_2016,homeless,"So you have the huge amount of homeless, of course, but then there's, I think, a huge number of people, I don't know how many, but in my own personal acquaintance, which is actually quite small, um,  a lot of people are under housed. And so they're not on the radar screen of being homeless. Because they're in a temporary of substandard or transitional or couch surfing or living in a garage or having to move [TIME] away from work and school and community and so forth."
04_27_2016,homeless,"I'm [PERSON], and I am homeless. [PERSON], I will turn [LOCATION]. I'm in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood."
04_27_2016,homeless,"And I've met other...  people who are also seniors that are homeless on the [STREET]. Not all of us out there are into the drug scene, are alcoholics, but we are definitely homeless. I've met veterans."
04_27_2016,homeless,"I met one in a wheelchair, shot up in [ORGANIZATION] who can't even get the medical help he needs, and he's homeless in a wheelchair. Something is terribly wrong in the [PERSON]. Thank you for being here."
04_27_2016,homeless,"And then we tore down all the interesting houses and buildings for nothing. And then the third point they wanted me to offer for your consideration was,  If we take all the industrial land for housing all the new people that are coming up here, won't we have more homeless? Because no industry-type jobs like welders that pay well for people who are different learners – I can't tell what schools – I went to a [ORGANIZATION] school – for people who are different learners –  So they didn't go to a regular type college but still want to support a family."
03_01_2017,homelessness,"We here cannot control the present deconstruction of our nation's long-lived native ideologies, even as we witness them [ORGANIZATION]. but with careful thought and prudent actions we can minimize their local effects of which homelessness is a vital one i simply wish to close by saying we are playing a new game with new rules and that we must think anew and act anew those were the remarks of a pretty good republican president at one time and he concluded by saying We must disenthrall ourselves"
03_01_2017,homeless,"or some homeless [STREET] kid. He was a funny, adventurous teen who, like most kids, at times can be a little rebellious. He was my child."
03_01_2017,homeless,"And actually, it doesn't make it an independent review. If you're going to give $15,000 for the homeless, give it to [ORGANIZATION] and his housing bureau and don't have somebody do anything that naturally will do things. And also, as a [ORGANIZATION] is not necessarily qualified, it's a school."
03_01_2017,affordable housing,"Questions? Yes, sir. Mr. [PERSON], I think when this was originally filed, an affordable housing impact statement was not part of the submission."
03_01_2017,homelessness,"maybe even an entry-level police officer. But the challenge that we continue to face is we have people in shelters and on the [STREET] and thousands of people and while this housing fills a need in the community and serves a purpose, it is not actually addressing the most acute crisis that we're experiencing, which is homelessness. and its related challenges."
03_14_2018,homeless,"A rather too common occurrence in my life. But when the police swiftly appear at my house, case the [STREET], and assure me it's safe after I returned home [TIME] to find my door ajar, or when I witness them with much care and patience handling a woman in a cafe with a severe mental breakdown, when I enjoy their friendly, supportive attitude at [ORGANIZATION],  When my friend tells me [TIME] a cop stopped him because he was driving a [ORGANIZATION] bus with one headlight, no taillights, no tags, no driver's license, and a bag of weed on the seat, the cop just started laughing, told him to go straight home and fix all that, excuse my language, shit [ORGANIZATION]. Or, when a police officer comes upon an abandoned van, searches for the owner and through his friends, finds a homeless man in a vacant building with his dogs, takes him to the van, helps him walk the dogs for several blocks, then returns DATE1 to follow up and make sure the man was okay and the dogs were okay, when police commit acts of courage and kindness, then gee, I'm bursting with gratitude."
03_14_2018,homelessness,"It looks like you've lived all over the world. And I'm impressed with your work, particularly around poverty and housing instability and homelessness. That's obviously front and center here in the city."
03_14_2018,homeless; houseless,How do you think you can bring those skills to bear as a member of the [ORGANIZATION]? What do you hope to accomplish or what perspective do you hope to provide? So I've worked in the field of homeless and houseless services for [ORGANIZATION].
03_14_2018,homeless; houseless,"And I think that that's a perspective that's largely left out of the main conversation because when you're homeless or houseless, you don't have the bandwidth necessarily to participate and you're not necessarily believed. And so I think having that experience will help bring those voices front and center. Very good."
03_14_2018,homelessness,"And as you know, I happen to be the police commissioner in addition to mayor, as luck would have it. and there are a lot of issues with homelessness and making sure that we are acting appropriately and accountably, and I think the [ORGANIZATION] does a great job of holding our feet to the fire to make sure that we do. So I think that's a useful experience to be bringing to the commission at this particular time."
03_14_2018,affordable housing,"Approve interim use of the multiple unit limited tax exemption program to capture opportunities for affordable housing in housing developments not subject to inclusionary housing and amend administrative rules. Colleagues, [ORGANIZATION] we're taking up a plan that addresses the projects that were in the pipeline before the inclusionary housing initiative. program was enacted."
03_14_2018,affordable housing,"We have an affordability crisis here in [ORGANIZATION]. We have declared a housing emergency, and that's why [ORGANIZATION]  enacted inclusionary housing requirements in the first [STREET]. DATE0 we're taking up this program for the projects that are not required to build affordable housing."
03_14_2018,housing crisis,"This is not an academic question. We're in a housing crisis, and the need exists now, and the public expects us to act now. The multiple unit limited tax exemption, or multi, is a proven tool that we can use to reach back into the pipeline of housing projects, projects that are moving through the system as we speak, projects that are going to be built, and make sure that some of those units become affordable units."
03_14_2018,housing crisis; affordable housing,"Not doing anything means that all of the units will be brought onto the market at prevailing market rates.  Not doing anything means we lose an opportunity to ensure that we're taking the housing crisis seriously. With the ordinance before you, I propose we use [ORGANIZATION] to incentivize those building housing in [ORGANIZATION] to include affordable housing in those projects. The program includes sensible safeguards."
03_14_2018,affordable housing,"Four were for buildings that had a [ORGANIZATION] tax exemption of over $500,000. And four were partially affordable housing projects that had some market rate residential. So it wouldn't have been a good comparison."
03_14_2018,affordable housing,"And so that's what [ORGANIZATION] has pulled out, is projects that have a larger number of affordable units and I'm likely to be a for-profit developer who is developing affordable housing. I know that's... We'll keep going."
03_14_2018,affordable housing,"Love what you're trying to do to create some [ORGANIZATION], bring people into the – create some affordable housing with units that are – beat the deadline. but aren't quite sure whether the abatement should cover all the units or just the affordable units? What's, from your point of view, the most compelling argument to make it apply to all the units and not just the affordable units?"
03_14_2018,housing crisis,"Now, I'm willing to use whatever diplomatic skills and call in on friendships and everything else I can at the county to get their support. But, frankly, I would hope that they would enthusiastically embrace a project like this and tools like this to get some immediate help for people who are lower income in the middle of a housing crisis. So, Mayor, I've been on this body for too long, and so I'm just going to offer just a slight rebuttal."
03_14_2018,affordable housing,"Commissioner [PERSON]. Thank you, [PERSON]. [PERSON] is second to nobody in her history of working for affordable housing."
03_14_2018,housing crisis,"There are proponents of density and development who want us to believe that our housing crisis is just a simple question of supply and demand, which is false. Because when you have a gross product mismatch between what is being supplied at $120, which is above the median income,  And the demand, which is below 100 median family income, it doesn't – we may see softening at the top of the market. And, in fact, we see fairly high vacancy at the top of the market."
03_14_2018,affordable housing,"It's tough to perhaps nearly impossible to build at 60% to 80% right now, given just the cost of land and the expense of construction. So I think anything we can do within reason to help them deliver the housing we actually need is worthwhile. And finally, I would like to add that I also am very interested in  the possibility of bumping affordable housing developments in the private market ahead in the queue as an additional incentive."
03_14_2018,affordable housing,"The whole concept, the idea that all the affordable housing is in one building.  rather than scattered throughout buildings all throughout the city. I really, really can't say enough about that concept. And, you know, the affordable units or subsidized, whatever you want to call the units in a building that has market rate units,  they have the opportunity to do things such as not put in granite countertops and stainless steel appliances and hardwood floors and things like that and make these units so that their maintenance and their upkeep and the cost of just constructing them within this space  that's going to be market rate, there's a lot of things that they can do."
03_14_2018,affordable housing,"You know, oftentimes when we've had conversations here about the affordable housing buildings all throughout FAC0, the comment I often hear is, and you can't tell from the outside that it's affordable housing. Well, you can tell from the inside. Right."
03_14_2018,affordable housing,"I'm reading all of your minds. Get to the bottom of this. If I could just quickly add that my office is in conversation with private developers who are vested in the queue, who are very interested in incentives for affordable housing."
03_14_2018,affordable housing,"These are not very exciting, but they definitely include a lot of split-zone sites, cleanup of our overlays, finding new non-conforming commercial sites,  And a lot of [ORGANIZATION]-coordinated map changes, so we've been working with [ORGANIZATION] of Environmental Services, the Housing [ORGANIZATION], and [ORGANIZATION] to incorporate some recent acquisitions that those bureaus have made. And then also in this group, there is a concerted effort to coordinate with our affordable housing providers. I have mentioned the Portland Housing [ORGANIZATION], but that also includes [ORGANIZATION], ORG6, ORG7, [ORGANIZATION], ORG9, and others."
03_14_2018,affordable housing,"DATE0, the property owner of [ORGANIZATION] asked [ORGANIZATION] to further upzone their property to ORG1. It's a small residential lot. And convinced ORG2, who has FAC1, an affordable housing complex there called FAC2, to come along with that."
03_14_2018,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] has [ORGANIZATION] reconsidered. [ORGANIZATION]'s own staff recommended to ORG2 that keeping with the original CM2 designation was the best idea, but ORG2 decided to move forward with the CM3 zoning anyway. ORG3, which operates the affordable housing on FAC0, has told [ORGANIZATION] that they can only afford to build the CM2 size and were fine with the original designation."
03_14_2018,affordable housing,"The property is owned by [ORGANIZATION] and adjacent to our worship facilities and parking lot. The lot is also an environmental conservation overlay zone, which limits how it can be developed. [ORGANIZATION] is in discussions with [ORGANIZATION] to sell the parcel at a discounted price to allow for the development of affordable housing as a part of the ministry of [ORGANIZATION] Bible Church and the mission of [ORGANIZATION]."
03_14_2018,affordable housing,"The change meets the [DATE] Comprehensive Plan Goal of affordable housing development in areas with close proximity to transit services and amenities. It also meets the anti-displacement goals and the goal of helping to close the minority homeownership gap. The site is within a half mile of [ORGANIZATION], and FAC1."
03_14_2018,affordable housing,"Yeah, please. We have a package before us of upzoning some affordable housing developments, and the theory there is we want to give people the ability to serve even more people. You are proposing to partner with [ORGANIZATION] to build on your footprint, correct?"
03_14_2018,affordable housing,"The church was also the previous owner of that property and sold it to [ORGANIZATION] at a discount so that we could provide homeownership opportunities to low-income working families. In fact, Mayor [PERSON], you may remember speaking at the key ceremony [ORGANIZATION] when we were selling those seven homes. The church is again willing to consider selling property to [ORGANIZATION] at a discounted price, which is very exciting given the challenges affordable housing developers face in finding property in [LOCATION]'s housing market."
03_14_2018,affordable housing,"That would help provide more than 100 people with stable, affordable housing in a neighborhood with great schools, access to transit, and nearby amenities. So was this amendment heard by [ORGANIZATION]? No. I just want to personally thank you, [PERSON], for really being a true community-facing church."
03_14_2018,affordable housing,They thought that that could be possibly student housing and also more affordable housing for anybody that lives in this area. So we really appreciate your consideration on this. They plan on staying here.
03_14_2018,affordable housing,"And the reason that's important, we didn't realize this was all happening until we were looking into actually how we're going to restore our building. Yeah. We are presently in the process of developing 120 units of affordable housing for our workforce to try and really target low-wage workers in our campus on FAC0 between FAC1 and FAC2."
03_14_2018,affordable housing,"And so we would love to have the opportunity to actually consider developing this property in the future to increase the stock of affordable housing for workforce folks in our community. We would respectfully hope you'll support the commissioner's. So, colleagues, I'm new to this conversation, and some people that we respect really highly regarding the community have started to think about this."
03_14_2018,affordable housing,"And the concept that really has drawn me in is that we have nonprofit providers in our community that are land rich and are currently having trouble recruiting people for certain positions because of the housing market. And the idea that [ORGANIZATION] and others are thinking about is what if we leveraged the land on our campus  to build affordable housing so that we were able to offer someone not just a job but a [STREET] to live that's also conveniently located. There are a multitude of nonprofit entities that are in the same situation where they're competing for a workforce that's being pushed out of the community that are rich in land, and it seemed to me that it's –  a very big discussion that we ought to start engaging."
03_14_2018,affordable housing,"There are six [ORGANIZATION] churches that gave me their property addresses. And so with the partnership with [ORGANIZATION], we are looking at all of these parcels and looking at what we think we could actually develop in terms of the numbers of units.  of affordable housing and essentially use our land that we own outright as equity to put into the deals and then figure out how to use a combination of low-income tax credits and traditional financing and then find equity financing that would enable us to bridge that gap to build really targeted workforce housing. By the [STREET], just one last comment."
03_14_2018,affordable housing,"Mayor, commissioners, thanks for the opportunity to be here [ORGANIZATION]. I'm [PERSON] with [ORGANIZATION]. We are affordable housing developers."
03_14_2018,affordable housing,So the current owner of that affordable housing development is [ORGANIZATION]? Yes. But you said that the affordable housing was going to go away.
03_14_2018,affordable housing,"Now the city proposes to rezone the house across the [STREET], which also has as its neighbor an apartment complex, which for [ORGANIZATION] I've seen no one except ethnic minorities and single mothers live in. And between that and the rent law proposals, it seems the city proposes to make it safer for single homeowners to [ORGANIZATION] rather than rent rooms, while simultaneously sacrificing affordable Section 8 and affordable housing to developers one building at a time, reflecting on what she said earlier. Okay."
03_14_2018,affordable housing,"I've spent my whole career just about in housing development and affordable housing development, and I'm very keen to that issue. The benefit of the zone change that we're proposing on the half block across the [STREET] is that we're currently parked on two other lots that [ORGANIZATION] owns to the west and to the south that are quarter blocks that are also zoned RH. And those are jammed parking on [ORGANIZATION] [TIME]."
03_14_2018,affordable housing,tall uh we welcome redevelopment we think that the school probably is not safe especially for children so we're looking forward to redevelopment and we especially welcome affordable housing it's a great site with schools and good transit so it's going to be an asset we're also appreciative of the fact that the city is the developer with non-profits we hope for much better development than we'd see with a for-profit developer quite frankly  We're [ADDRESS].
03_14_2018,affordable housing,"Oh, I just have one more thing. I wanted to thank everyone that came to testify [ORGANIZATION] because it was a really pleasant...  and very informative and I just appreciate how thoughtful everyone was and I didn't hear anyone really kind of advocating strictly for their own benefit. There was just a lot of recognition of community benefit and need for affordable housing and...  It's just really appreciated."
05_18_2016,homeless,"I was born in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], and I live here. I was homeless [ORGANIZATION]. Anyway, I'd like to brag that I'm kind of a prophet now."
05_18_2016,homeless,"We've created it with a crazy real estate market. People need to have rent stabilization. Some people have no other hope.  of not becoming homeless other than to have the government say, you know, if your property taxes went up zero and everything else about your property went up zero, at this time we can't have you kick your tenants out so that you can increase the rent 40%."
05_18_2016,homeless,"Okay, item 509, please. Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding improving the homeless situation. PERSON1, you hear?"
05_18_2016,homeless,"It does a lot of good things, but what it doesn't do is make sure that we reverse the decline of the workforce in [ORGANIZATION]. The other thing it doesn't do is create a new [STREET] for dealing with people who are homeless on our streets other than either ignoring the problem or arresting them. And the need for a diversion program is real."
05_18_2016,homeless,"Secondly, [ORGANIZATION] in particular is literally on the front lines in our effort  to try to stem gang violence. Unfortunately, we had an incident not long ago in which four young people were shot and wounded inside the [INSTITUTION], I think highlighting how serious the situation is there and the need. Meanwhile, [ORGANIZATION] has opened a family [INSTITUTION] basically just across the [STREET]."
05_18_2016,homeless,"In essence, there has been no consultation with [ORGANIZATION] about this plan of approach. And while I appreciate Commissioner [PERSON]'s.  raising these concerns i don't think it's appropriate to sort of prejudge the best [STREET] to accomplish the housing outreach that she desires is by placing this money in oni and so i'm proposing that we [STREET] the money in contingency we charge [ORGANIZATION] which has not been consulted on this and also the proposed joint office for homeless services which is also on the home for everyone which has also had no input on this that all these organizations  work together no presupposition about where the money lands but come up with the best outreach plan possible bring that back to council by [ORGANIZATION] for us to consider it and then take the money put the 350 000 in the contingency until we sign off on that plan  I think that is something that reflects a truly consensus approach to this and will result in, I think, the wisest expenditure of these dollars to achieve the much-needed outreach about housing in our city."
05_18_2016,homeless; affordable housing,"[STREET] it in contingency, charge the affected bureaus to come up with a plan that makes sense, not to prejudge that it's going to go to one bureau and then they have to, you know, call the shots. So I think if we're really interested in achieving the best outreach about what we're doing on housing, affordable housing development and homeless services, we should charge those bureaus to come back with a non-biased plan about how best to do the job  and then let council approve it by [ORGANIZATION] out of contingency. So I vote aye."
05_18_2016,homeless,"Here's how I come down. Two things. One, thanks to your leadership, Commissioner [PERSON], we are moving most of the homeless services staff out of [ORGANIZATION] and over to the county."
05_18_2016,homelessness,"And there are people in my office who spend a great deal of time dealing with homelessness issues, and we work a lot with neighborhoods. So I think it's not an unreasonable idea for [ORGANIZATION] to lead this work. I think it does have to come back to council."
05_18_2016,homeless,"no no sorry no i'm voting no one voting for commissioner [ORGANIZATION]'s uh uh the mayor version of the before we take a vote on the amendment to commissioner [ORGANIZATION]'s motion i have a friendly amendment okay  which is I do like the language as I read it in [PERSON]'s substitute about the proposed city-county joint office playing a role. I know it's implied, but could we make that explicit, that [ORGANIZATION], the proposed city-county joint office for homeless services, and the home for everyone be consulted in that outreach?"
05_18_2016,homeless,So to add in the budget note with it. [ORGANIZATION] to work with [PERSON] and ORG2 and the proposed [PERSON]. I believe it's implied.
05_18_2016,homeless,"but also with all of the affected parties okay roll call on Commissioner [PERSON]'s proposed budget note language as further amended well I appreciate the efforts as I said my concern is there's been no consultation with [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] and there's a prejudgment about which is the best ORG2 to conduct necessary housing And I don't feel this idea is really fully baked, so I vote no."
05_18_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,We have committed record funding to address affordable housing and homelessness. We have restored funding in audit services to ensure that they have the staff they need to provide independent oversight of council operations. We extended and expanded a very successful [ORGANIZATION] program supporting small businesses in [ORGANIZATION].
05_18_2016,homelessness,"modified zero-based budgeting, chief among them, and the discipline that we have shown together in targeting our resources to core community needs, be they public safety, housing and homelessness, or transportation infrastructure. Finally, I want to thank my team, led by [ORGANIZATION], and particularly PERSON1, PERSON2, PERSON3, PERSON4, PERSON5, and [PERSON]. DATE0, with this budget, I am proud to vote aye."
05_18_2016,homeless; affordable housing,"so i think you've done a great job mayor even though there was a fundamental disagreement about the fact that we have record revenue surplus revenues and the need for a new revenue source so i think you've got most of what you're getting in your budget  I particularly want to laud the restoration of 13 firefighters to general fund away from a federal grant, very critical positions, and the record investment under Mayor [PERSON]'s leadership in housing and homeless services. This really is, and joined by record investments on the county itself, I think we're poised to really make some differences, both in the production of affordable housing and in continued services to those who are homeless."
05_18_2016,homeless,"[TIME] we learned that the voters approved a major investment in [STREET] repair and traffic safety putting an end to [ORGANIZATION] of futility on those issues. DATE1 the [ORGANIZATION] is approving a budget. that, first of all, as my colleagues have said, makes major investments in housing and homeless facilities and services."
05_18_2016,homeless; affordable housing,"And I think it's worth calling some of that out. The budget includes over $29 million in new investments in housing, which is a 74% increase over the [ORGANIZATION] revised budget, 156% increase over the DATE1 budget. those new investments include 14.4 million for the housing investment fund which we use to develop or preserve affordable housing over 12 million for projects prioritized by the home for everyone collaboration including support for homeless veterans shelters and housing placement services 690 000 for costs related to maintaining and improving homeless campsites and additional funds for home repair grants home"
05_18_2016,homelessness,"In fact, we learn so much that we then followed up on those meetings and had a [ORGANIZATION] here in [ORGANIZATION], organized by [ORGANIZATION], thank you, that brought together the mayors of the major [ORGANIZATION] cities to talk about climate change and about housing and homelessness, and the Secretary of [ORGANIZATION] and the head of [ORGANIZATION] showed up for the meeting. And I learn a lot in those discussions. And one of the things that has become so clear for me in that context is that the world is moving to cities, not just this one, but the world is obviously moving here too."
05_18_2016,affordable housing,"DATE0 we will again act on school funding, and I'm really happy that we're spending over $100 million on three of our high schools to put them in good shape. And I really do believe we need to have more money for affordable housing. But boy, do we ride that poor, tired property tax horse hard, because it's kind of what we have for capital investments, with now the happy exception of a little bit of gas tax."
05_18_2016,homeless,"I don't know what the exact reason for that is, why the homeless people have to be out on FAC0 and pushed around by the police. I've never actually researched that particular block, but we generally know that vacant blocks get maintained by the [ORGANIZATION]. The same [ORGANIZATION], which in its budget, is apparently doing some weird deal with [ORGANIZATION] to fence off and rent space under FAC1  near [LOCATION]."
05_18_2016,affordable housing,"And this budget...  has a lot of things that I like in it and obviously no budget is perfect, but I also want to acknowledge that we did make your job more difficult by bumping the [ORGANIZATION] to 45 for affordable housing. And that that had a domino effect in other priorities within the [ORGANIZATION]. When we made the change to take housing out and to focus on economic development, I think at the time it was the right call."
05_18_2016,affordable housing,"I think as we look at manufactured home parks as an affordable housing option, particularly in some of the ones that we're going to be trying to save, and if they then become more of a long-term option,  there may be an opportunity to add one or two more spaces that would add one or two more affordable homes. And, you know, $560, as you say, is a minor amount for the [ORGANIZATION]. It's a [ORGANIZATION]'s rent for a manufactured home park occupant."
04_24_2019,homeless,"Thank you. Whereas everyone deserves an opportunity to rebuild their lives, reach their fullest potential, and become productive members of society, and whereas an estimated 70 million Americans have a criminal record, and over 600,000 are released from prison [DATE], and whereas justice-involved individuals often struggle to find housing, secure employment, pursue higher education, regain voting rights, and regain financial freedom,  and whereas justice-involved individuals are disproportionately represented in [ORGANIZATION]'s homeless and unemployed populations, and whereas people of color are disproportionately represented in [PERSON]'s prison system and face even higher barriers once they are released,  and whereas we are all safer when justice-involved individuals are given every opportunity to access stable homes, secure employment, and rebuild their lives. Now, therefore, I, [ORGANIZATION], on behalf of [ORGANIZATION], Mayor of the City of [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], [PERSON], do hereby proclaim [ORGANIZATION] to be [LOCATION] in [ORGANIZATION] and encourage all residents to observe DATE2."
04_27_2017,affordable housing,"Those will now begin to take effect and will help us steer and make sure that affordable housing happens where it's in proximity to  neighborhoods that are walkable, that are well-connected by transit and other options. So this, too, is an important part of how we grow in ways that reduce carbon emissions but also provide quality of life and affordability for all of our residents. The comprehensive plan is now in [STREET]."
04_27_2017,affordable housing,"And I want to mention that it's been a pleasure to begin working with Commissioner [PERSON] around an accessory dwelling unit project, which is going like gangbusters, I have to say. I feel like I'm supposed to be facilitating mostly running behind this 30 or 40 people that span the spectrum from architects to bankers to developers and people working for advocacy for seniors in affordable housing. So you'll hear more about that in the future."
04_27_2017,affordable housing,"And so I'm wondering if somewhere in this plan, you're looking at the impacts of our lack of affordable housing, at how displacement is affecting our climate plan, because we have so many workers who are forced out to the outskirts or out of the city altogether. That would be a really interesting...  frame for this for me personally. Some of the work we did in the development of the comprehensive plan, which you didn't have the benefit of sitting through [TIME] of work as some of the rest of [ORGANIZATION]."
04_15_2015,affordable housing,"By including students in multiple events per year, this program provides the practice necessary to build confidence and have one's voice heard. This advocacy practice also takes the form of questions at the microphone at [ORGANIZATION], where I've seen future leaders bravely ask questions about gun control, legislation protecting undocumented immigrants, affordable housing, and the lack of affordable arts opportunities in [ORGANIZATION]. These questions again build confidence."
04_15_2015,affordable housing,"But, again, in terms of tax breaks, I think it's pretty important to know when the city is actually giving people a break on taxes. We do it for affordable housing. but I'm pretty sure we haven't done it for fossil fuels."
04_15_2015,affordable housing,And then don't mandate that the affordable housing gets built. We're working on that. Commissioner [PERSON]?
04_15_2015,affordable housing,"Now, pertaining to affordable housing, one of the concerns I have is that the 30 percent MFI are below. We're not meeting the inventory out in the marketplace. We're meeting the inventory from private developers for a higher MFI."
04_15_2015,affordable housing,"And I think we need to plan aggressively on the affordable housing issue to meet this demand, like [ORGANIZATION] has done in their location, like FAC1 has done in their location. As I would propose that we set aside the purchase of [ORGANIZATION] at 715 Northwest Hoyt, approximately 13 acres, and designated that toward 30% medium MFI,  and develop that whole parcel out for that purpose. We have a lot of area there to work from, we have a lot of land, and we can build a tremendous amount of affordable units at 30% MFI."
04_15_2015,affordable housing,"And whereas [ORGANIZATION] and its partners are working together to combat discrimination, disparate impacts, and other impediments to housing choice,  and whereas the city council adopted [PERSON]'s first ever fair housing fair housing action plan in [ORGANIZATION] and established a fair housing advocacy committee to oversee its implementation and whereas the plan calls for a combination of enhanced outreach and education increased testing and enforcement an expanded supply of quality affordable housing options mitigation of displacement and increased inter-bureau coordination  And whereas [ORGANIZATION] is working with landlords and tenants to increase choice for low-income renters citywide, and whereas under federal fair housing laws, [ORGANIZATION] civil rights statutes, and GPE4 City Code, it is unlawful to discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, disability, familial status, national origin, marital status, sexual orientation, source of income...  military status, gender identity, age over [LOCATION], type of occupation, or history as a victim of domestic violence, and whereas [ORGANIZATION] of DATE2 states, actions to affirmatively further fair housing should further practices of the Fair Housing Act by actively promoting wider housing opportunity for all persons while maintaining a non-discriminatory environment  in all aspects of public and private housing markets, and whereas Executive Order [DATE], as amended, requires federal agencies to affirmatively further fair housing in their programs and activities, and whereas DATE3 marks the 47th anniversary of the signing of Title VIII of the Federal Civil Rights Act, also known as [ORGANIZATION] of DATE4, and the 27th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act amendments of [PERSON]. Now, therefore, I, [ORGANIZATION], Mayor of [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], do hereby proclaim [PERSON] to be [ORGANIZATION] in GPE4 and encourage all residents to observe [ORGANIZATION] by joining the effort to promote fair housing for all. Because fair housing is your right."
04_15_2015,affordable housing,"But four of them struck us as things that we needed to provide a little additional information to enrich the community's understanding and yours. So I want to speak directly. briefly to these four things exemptions plans for spending what's the deal about the commercial rates and what's this business about [ORGANIZATION] is based on size of housing exemptions the question is are we changing exemptions and we are making no changes to the existing exemption for park [ORGANIZATION]'s for affordable housing we're making no changes to the exemption for tenant improvements and folks this is one to remember the significance of that little phrase if you're planning on overhauling and moving into new business space  Some jurisdictions will charge you a new [ORGANIZATION] for that change in use, basically a tenant improvement."
04_15_2015,affordable housing,"I'm also pleased that you've not only reaffirmed the exclusion for affordable housing, but you put the campus housing issue on the table, and I think you've made a very compelling rationale for that. So I'm pleased that that's in your proposal. Two questions."
04_15_2015,affordable housing,"And third, as [ORGANIZATION] indicated, we're not breaking new ground here. There are a number of jurisdictions around the country of comparable size using a similar methodology. Regarding exemptions, we strongly support a continuation of the existing exemption for affordable housing so that we can ensure that the neediest Portlanders have a [STREET] to live."
04_15_2015,affordable housing,"So I think there are ways that we can stretch the dollars and still acquire land. And just as [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] have entered into a compact to work more closely to integrate their missions, so too should ORG2,  [PERSON], all four bureaus get together and figure out how they can meld their missions to actually create situations where you have parkland as well as addressing some of the issues related to stormwater and so forth. All of that said, the city should continue to aggressively acquire as much additional acreage needed to serve our citizens and protect our natural landscapes, and we strongly support the exemption for affordable housing."
04_15_2015,homeless,"We care about the quality and affordability of the city's housing, neighborhoods, communities, and park systems. And we've built, remodeled, and improved hundreds of beds of capacity of several transitional [INSTITUTION] providers in [ORGANIZATION] and throughout the region. With those credentials, I ask for your careful attention and consideration."
04_15_2015,affordable housing,"It will encourage the construction of smaller, more affordable housing, and we hope to see this policy emulated in SDCs levied for transportation, sewer, and water. I would be remiss if I failed to thank Commissioners [PERSON] and [PERSON] for their advocacy for [ORGANIZATION]. Please approve the methodology update so that this work can continue."
04_15_2015,affordable housing,"And what about the situation that Mr. [PERSON] mentioned where it's the same square footage, but we're dividing one apartment into two? I think we need to look at that in terms of what is the actual building permit, and we can get a response back. I also heard him say something about affordable housing, and I wasn't sure if he was qualified under that exemption."
04_15_2015,affordable housing,"That's our initials, so I might say that again. And I'm also an energy efficiency advocate in [ORGANIZATION], and I work for [ORGANIZATION], and we work on energy efficiency and water efficiency measures for affordable housing in [PERSON]. So I'm very interested in this, and I want to  show my support for it."
04_15_2015,affordable housing,"On the work you're doing, one of the many hats you're wearing that involves environment and affordable housing, did I hear that? No, not necessarily. The environment?"
05_27_2015,homeless,"Go ahead. And this is in regard to [ORGANIZATION], right? Well, [ORGANIZATION]'s running a lot of these homeless raids."
05_27_2015,affordable housing,as our housing costs rise and as we try to deal with the questions of affordable housing. So this council will be meeting in work session to dig into those issues in detail to look at the total impact of everything that we do on both the cost side of housing and on what we can do to improve the opportunities for people to still be able to afford to live either as homeowners or renters in our city as [ORGANIZATION] becomes more and more popular. Thank you.
05_27_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"The first is that the recommendation continues the exemption for low-income housing in our community. We have an affordable housing crisis in our community, and let's not kid ourselves. It is primarily a function of people that have either no money or less than 30% of medium family income."
05_27_2015,affordable housing,"We can debate the various strategies for preserving a middle class in our community and the value of investing in workforce housing. But the crisis in our community is at zero to 30, is the poorest of the poor, and this recommendation continues an exemption for affordable housing, which I strongly support. Second, it, for the first time, scales the [ORGANIZATION] to the size of the houses."
05_27_2015,affordable housing,"I'm very grateful for the deep commitment to affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]. And I also appreciate within the framework of the new strategic plan, the additional emphasis we'll be placing on the creative economy as a potential driver. as one of the clusters we'll be looking at."
04_21_2015,homeless,"I was homeless, living in a car for [ORGANIZATION] due to no fault of my own.  before I became a cab driver. Within [PERSON], I had a two-bedroom apartment with hardwoods and big windows that was pet-friendly. And I currently bring in $35 to $45 an hour after expenses."
04_21_2015,homeless,"I also lease my car out to individuals who are also formerly homeless now, thanks to the taxi industry. So this industry has literally saved my lives and the lives of others. And I'm very much looking forward to buying another vehicle and continuing to sponsor other formerly homeless individuals into this industry."
04_21_2015,homeless,"I will not be able to do that if I become homeless again. We've seen in [ORGANIZATION] that since [ORGANIZATION] reached saturation... Taxi drivers have seen a decrease in 35 to 80% in their fares, yet those drivers for the taxi companies are still making 30 to 60% more than [ORGANIZATION] drivers because [ORGANIZATION] cuts its prices to push out the competition, which puts its drivers at an economic disadvantage."
03_12_2015,affordable housing,"and then i am happy to talk about any other other issues you want to bring up so this is uh the quick summary of the um the topics we were asked to come back and address And we'll walk through them, but the issues were that we had a summary of the impact of the changes to affordable housing. We were asked about parks and transportation."
03_12_2015,affordable housing,"So now moving on to the summary of [ORGANIZATION], and without getting into all the –  The details here, people can read these, but FAC1 is a super block, so it's basically two city blocks, a very large block in the central district of [ORGANIZATION] that was purchased by [ORGANIZATION]. So it's an [ORGANIZATION] property. And then around, you see the timeline in [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] acquired [ORGANIZATION] –  So not the land, but the rights to develop above a future garage for affordable housing."
03_12_2015,affordable housing,"One would be an affordable housing tower. There would be [ORGANIZATION] administrative offices in that we would then at that time have to contribute our share of that garage, which was estimated to be $4 million. So when  Once again, we paid the money up front for the air rights."
03_12_2015,affordable housing,"And then, of course, the streetcar was funded in part from tax increment here. We've had –  Relative to other renewal areas, significantly less investment in this area, in loans to businesses, affordable housing, and you can see other types of community development, kind of smaller grant activity that we do, particularly in our neighborhood renewal areas. [ORGANIZATION] has been very clear in expressing desire to make investments in projects  in growing the business base within this urban renewal area, given what they believe has been a front-loaded investment in things like parks, like the FAC0 and the streetcar."
03_12_2015,affordable housing,"It does. The number's big, but it's just like any other transaction. If we are able to go in and buy that property, we would need to hold it, do all sorts of things, master plan it, do the proper [STREET] of soliciting interest in the property, making sure that the needs of the community are met, so whether there's additional open space requirements, affordable housing requirements, etc.  there's rights of [STREET] that need to be developed so it's it will not be flipped which was what was characterized here in the last hearing we had it will be either money in the best scenario money that we invest and get back out"
03_12_2015,affordable housing,"Well, I –  First off, if we're improving the value of publicly owned land, the sale would benefit both taxpayers, ratepayers. But that's also the same question that we're having about what are the community benefits for our development. And we've talked about affordable housing."
03_12_2015,affordable housing,"And since there is just one other major landowner other than this. And I'm sorry, and Commissioner [PERSON] has, you know, he's already put out the covenant around affordable housing, right? I think as I shared with all of you after our last hearing that, you know, if the fire bureau property does transfer, then I intend to make sure there's a covenant, a deed restriction that requires that affordable housing be developed on that  fire bureau property."
03_12_2015,affordable housing,"We've had, actually, collective master planning conversations. I don't believe we've crossed over to the stage of a development agreement, but they've been part of our conversations around [ORGANIZATION]  around what development is possible in that full triangle. And in the information that you've given us, there's some breakout about how much might go to affordable housing, how much might go to transportation infrastructure, et cetera, off the $20 million."
03_12_2015,affordable housing,yeah no idea what's going to be developed there or when and and i think that there's it's probably room to have um to have the the intent expressed now about there being affordable housing and and other outcomes
03_12_2015,affordable housing,"So we were now going to open the floor to amendments on any of these items that council members want to bring forward. If it's appropriate, I would offer an amendment that says, upon the transfer of any fire bureau land in [ORGANIZATION], an affordable housing covenant be recorded against the deed. So that removes the issue of who's the fire commissioner at the time if we put it in right now."
05_16_2018,housing crisis,"[PERSON], a request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding housing crisis for people of color, the color of law. He called [TIME] and is not able to make it. I'm sorry to hear that."
05_16_2018,homeless,"462, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council to declare state of emergency pertaining to homeless children. Good morning, sir. Good morning."
05_16_2018,homeless,"One of the issues I have is on just how many homeless children we have out through [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON].  in all different areas throughout the neighborhoods. And the reality is that I don't think we're getting the real data, rather than actual numbers on how serious this is. In my opinion, Governor [PERSON], and when you decide to come into [PERSON], I'd love to have a meeting with you."
05_16_2018,homeless,"You're failing miserably. You're failing miserably pertaining to the homeless children. And I want to see real data, updated data, real numbers, data,  that you're getting from [ORGANIZATION], and yet that doesn't show the real picture of what's happening."
05_16_2018,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION], 1,200. We're talking thousands and thousands of homeless children, students, not getting into housing, being put into hotels, being put into shelters, housing. Young, developing minds having stress and trauma put upon them because they can't go to school with their friends."
05_16_2018,homeless,"I want a governor in there that looks at this problem and says, this is a state of emergency for the children. Children into housing first, and we will come up with the money. You have failed the homeless children in [ORGANIZATION], Governor [PERSON], and I am asking you to step down."
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"We can form a 501c3 and get half the money for this thing, okay, because there's the opportunity of development along this trail, affordable housing as well as market rate housing. You already see six projects going on right now, okay? But how do we get there?"
05_16_2018,homeless,"So I've lived here since [ORGANIZATION]. I've definitely noticed a couple of issues that really stand out. I think the homeless is really out of hand, and I think that they need more opportunities to show themselves in a positive light for the people that want to make changes."
05_16_2018,homeless,"Next item, 467. Authorize a loan in an amount not to exceed $500,[ADDRESS] for use as a [INSTITUTION]. Colleagues, [ORGANIZATION] ORG1 allocated $1.25 million for new shelters, and we've requested ORG2 to direct $500,000 to this project."
05_16_2018,homeless; homelessness,"The item in front of us [ORGANIZATION] is to authorize $500,000 in funding to [ORGANIZATION] to acquire a new shelter, augmenting shelter capacity here in [ORGANIZATION]. This project will add to the available temporary housing options for families experiencing homelessness, serving homeless families at their most vulnerable. With us [ORGANIZATION] is, of course, [ORGANIZATION], who's the ORG1 Interim Director."
05_16_2018,homeless,"We have...  [ORGANIZATION], who's the Executive Director of [ORGANIZATION]. And I'm sorry, can you remind me? PERSON1 with [PERSON]."
05_16_2018,homeless; homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION] has done extensive private fundraising, and we are pleased to be able to join them with the final needed funds for this purchase. As we all know, of course, shelter is not the solution to homelessness. Housing is."
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"And we are pleased that we've been able to create 458 new units of affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION] and have an additional 259 in the pipeline. We will also ensure that if this property is not used as a shelter or for affordable housing, we will be able to secure the land for affordable housing in the future. Thank you."
05_16_2018,homeless,"Thank you for having me here [ORGANIZATION]. My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I have been the Executive Director of [ORGANIZATION] for [LOCATION]. Our mission is to empower homeless families with children to get back into housing and stay there long term."
05_16_2018,homeless,"Our roots go back to [ORGANIZATION] when a group of committed volunteers created [ORGANIZATION], which houses eight homeless families with children [TIME] the year. Families come at [TIME] and they leave by 7.30 [TIME]. Over [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION] has expanded [ORGANIZATION] to include robust social services that help over 200 families DATE2."
05_16_2018,homelessness,"DATE0 we operate several programs. We operate a [ORGANIZATION] program that helps families experiencing homelessness move back into housing. DATE1 we helped 185 families or 653 moms, dads and kids move back into housing."
05_16_2018,homeless; homelessness,"In our [ORGANIZATION], families with [TIME] eviction notices get help keeping their housing and preventing homelessness before it even starts. And we operate shelter programs with [ORGANIZATION] for eight families with children [TIME] the year, [PERSON] at ORG2 for 75 moms, dads, and kids during [ORGANIZATION], and [ORGANIZATION], which is the day center for both of the night programs. Over [LOCATION], we served 700 individuals."
05_16_2018,homeless,Sixty-one percent of those people were children. Half of those children were under [ORGANIZATION]. Everyone in [ORGANIZATION] can see that we are experiencing a homeless crisis and a housing state of emergency.
05_16_2018,homelessness,"But what everyone doesn't know is how many people who experience homelessness are children and their parents. DATE0, there were 4,317 students that experienced homelessness in [ORGANIZATION] alone. 4,300 students experienced homelessness in [LOCATION]."
05_16_2018,homeless,"Our shelters are full and over capacity. Kids don't have a [STREET] to eat, do their homework, sleep, or just relax. If a family became homeless [TIME] in [ORGANIZATION], there is literally nowhere that they could go to find safe shelter."
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"There's a large back parking lot that we would plan to develop into affordable housing in the future. We would also invite other social service agencies to come provide wraparound services like mental health, domestic violence advocacy, child care, and employment. [ORGANIZATION] has a track record of success over [ORGANIZATION] to show that our approach to services works."
05_16_2018,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] asks you to vote in favor of a $500,000 equity gap contribution to help [ORGANIZATION] acquire this great family shelter campus in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood. Thanks so much, and I'm happy to answer questions. Thanks, [ORGANIZATION]."
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I reside in northwest [ORGANIZATION]. I'm also very recently, as of [ORGANIZATION], a property owner in FAC0, where my husband and I have bought a small vacant lot, hoping to develop some naturally affordable housing."
05_16_2018,homeless,"And for [ORGANIZATION], I've had the honor of serving on [ORGANIZATION] of ORG1. And I'm here [LOCATION] to urge approval of this ordinance and make the case that this is a sound public investment. I'm convinced that this new family center will be a success."
05_16_2018,homelessness,"And what we want to provide for families who are already experiencing the trauma of homelessness  trauma-informed care is something where people don't have additional trauma forced on them, and having to get up at 6.30 in the morning [ORGANIZATION] a week and be out the door, up the back stairs, and not be seen by anybody at 7.30 in the morning is really just not very conducive to [LOCATION]. I think this is a great opportunity. It's amazing how quickly it's come together."
05_16_2018,homeless,"I can't tell you how excited I was to see this on the agenda [TIME], especially in lieu of the work that I'm now doing with [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]. I was really excited to hear about the potential of the 458 affordable units and the focus on families. I find it just so interesting how timely, after [ORGANIZATION] spoke [TIME] about his concern about homeless families."
05_16_2018,homeless,"And, you know, we just – it just speaks to what the private sector can do and how quickly –  these things can move along as well. And I just want to say kudos to [ORGANIZATION] for what they're doing. We at [ORGANIZATION] may be reaching out to you as one of the agencies that we look to to help in our endeavors."
05_16_2018,homeless; affordable housing; unhoused,"And I also want to kind of throw a little shout-out as you're designing affordable housing programs  to also be thinking in terms of how you...  kind of find a [STREET] to put those people who are homeless and unhoused at the top of the waiting list, in the front line, before people who are housed move into those buildings, who are just moving from one home to another home. Right now, the affordable housing projects around the city are tightening up their eligibility criteria  They want people to have [ORGANIZATION] of rental history. We all know that people currently living on the streets are not going to qualify under those kinds of tight restrictions."
05_16_2018,affordable housing; unhoused,"they're denying people that have felony convictions and not even doing any kind of special review or anything like that. So as you're moving forward with this, think in terms of how can this affordable housing reach out to the people who are unhoused right now and put them at the front of the line. And again, I urge you to approve this loan."
05_16_2018,homeless,"Again, my biggest concern is when they're dealing with the homeless children, children need to be first to get into permanent housing. Children need to be first to get into any beds in a shelter. Children need to be first, and there is no negotiating on this."
05_16_2018,homeless,They do good work. They're focusing in the right area. But I think they would also agree that data pertaining to the homeless children and the students that are homeless and the kids that are sleeping in cars two blocks from their school with their parents to go to school because they don't have housing or any other opportunity available  Do they lose their kids when the police officer drives up and sees two kids in the backseat and they're two blocks from the school trying to take their kids to the school?
05_16_2018,homeless,"It is a [ORGANIZATION] loan that is forgivable, and I assume that the decision was made to do that versus a grant for strategic reasons. But it's a good investment. [ORGANIZATION] is one of our best partners, and [ORGANIZATION], a recipient of the Skidmore Prize, is one of the brightest lights in our work."
05_16_2018,homeless,"I appreciate [PERSON] for undertaking this effort, and I think it's very appropriate for us as a city to put in an amount that will help push this over the finish line and get this shelter open as soon as possible. Hi. You DATE0."
05_16_2018,homeless,"PERSON0? Well, thank you, especially to [ORGANIZATION] for the presentation about your work, which addresses everything that we heard in testimony. Thank you, [PERSON], for volunteering and for taking the time to come in to support this resolution."
05_16_2018,homeless,"PERSON0. So this is [ORGANIZATION], and I appreciate [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]. It's always a pleasure to see you and to appreciate, again, the great work that you and your organization are doing."
05_16_2018,homeless,"This is one of them. and you heard the passion from some of the people who are testifying, I share that passion. I would not be sitting in this chair  but for the fact that for [ORGANIZATION] I was an [TIME] volunteer shelter host at [ORGANIZATION], now [ORGANIZATION]."
05_16_2018,homeless,"And my impression was the impression that was shared from the dais here [TIME], that that 730, you're up, you're out, anybody here who has small kids knows what that's really like. And that's in good circumstances. Now imagine that you are living in a homeless situation."
05_16_2018,homeless; homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION] does because they're really good, once somebody is in the shelter, at getting them out of the shelter and getting them into housing. And collectively, through [ORGANIZATION], we moved 5,000 people from shelter into housing. And that doesn't even count the 6,[ADDRESS]."
05_16_2018,homelessness,for the youth family shelter services that we provide here. And that was one of the few instances during that short session where dollars were actually allocated for a purpose like this. So I feel like there is that consensus and that push and that passion to address homelessness youth in our community.
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"Authorize the transfer of density from FAC0, located at [ADDRESS], to [ORGANIZATION] for the construction of needed housing units on adjacent property. Commissioner [PERSON]. Colleagues, I'm extremely excited to present this exciting technical and...  one key [STREET] of providing affordable housing."
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"It combines all of my passions of housing, parks, and planning. So I'm very excited about this. As the most recent [ORGANIZATION] Commissioner, I was asked to donate development rights on [ORGANIZATION]'s FAC0 to ORG2 so that they can build more affordable housing units on their adjacent lot."
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"Mayor. My name is [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] for the record. As Commissioner [PERSON] said, this action would transfer development rights from FAC0 to ORG1 for affordable housing units."
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"As you can see, FAC0 is located just south of the community garden. Essentially, this ordinance provides the ability to transfer two more dwelling units to the FAC0 development to increase the affordable housing in that area. And just to interject, all of the brown part, we are rezoning to open space as well because that's FAC1."
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"And is there any [STREET] that we could find a [STREET] to buy it for an affordable housing project before we put it on the market? They reached out to us because the wife of the realtor had heard a story on [ORGANIZATION] radio about ORG1 advocacy for tenant rights in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood. And so from there, we started knocking on every door of every affordable housing provider and ORG2."
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"And so we thought, well, if we could get some of that density transferred next door, we could make affordable housing opportunities available for even more families than would otherwise be allowed on this land. So that was really our motivation for making the connection with Commissioner [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION]. Okay."
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"In addition to creating more opportunities, the ability to add density specifically for affordable housing projects makes it more likely for those projects to pencil out because a [ORGANIZATION] like [ORGANIZATION] can spread the land acquisition cost across more units. And so being able to do that specifically for an affordable housing project  and not allowing that ability for a market rate developer makes non-profit [ORGANIZATION], affordable housing development, more feasible and makes it easier for them to compete on the open market. So we really hope that this will be a precedent, a replicable model where the city can look at other properties owned by all of its bureaus that have unused residential density, even on properties that are never going to be used for housing, like a parks community garden, and see,"
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"I am the [ORGANIZATION] Director at [ORGANIZATION], and we would like to thank you, the ORG1, and ORG2 for your vigorous efforts to preserve and enhance [ORGANIZATION]'s affordable housing. In particular, [TIME], we'd like to thank ORG1er [ORGANIZATION] and her staff for shepherding the zoning density transfer through the planning process. And what I would like to share with you are some details about [ORGANIZATION] and the populations that we serve."
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"Established in [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] has worked to provide stable, affordable housing and community programs to thousands of families who would otherwise have been displaced by the forces of gentrification in northeast [ORGANIZATION]. Currently, our resident demographics resemble what northeast [ORGANIZATION] looked like in [LOCATION]. So our population is approximately 70% African American, and most of whom have lived in the neighborhood for DATE2."
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] also established [ORGANIZATION]'s first land trust and limited equity lease purchase programs and developed 115 units of rental housing that allows low-income families and individuals to stay in their neighborhoods. It is incumbent upon [ORGANIZATION] as a small community-based organization to create unique partnerships and approaches to...  the development of affordable housing. When ORG2 approached [ORGANIZATION] with the idea of purchasing the property and increasing its potential density, we welcomed the opportunity as a chance to further our mission and provide much needed affordable home ownership opportunities in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood."
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"Also, allowing for a nine-unit housing development as opposed to seven units of housing will ensure that this project is feasible and sustainable, and we look forward to its fruition. Thank you again for your consideration in support of affordable housing. Thank you."
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"We have said that in the central city. So that's going to open up hundreds of units of housing, which the city can decide how it is allocated, and which will make inclusionary housing and a lot of other affordable housing feasible just like this. We're also, [ORGANIZATION], since you mentioned it, let's get it in before the comprehensive plan changes, we're going to do another zoning code change [ORGANIZATION] saying that for all the properties that were previously residentially zoned and are now going to be open spaced outside of the central city, that those units don't just disappear."
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"It is going to, I think, make a huge difference for affordable housing throughout our city. PERSON0. PERSON1. So I am unabashedly a huge fan of this."
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"Colleagues, DATE0 I have the privilege of appointing a community member to [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION], currently who is the Deputy Executive Director at [ORGANIZATION]. She's had DATE1 of experience with mission-based work, creating affordable housing opportunities, economic development, and community building."
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"She believes a home is the most important [STREET]. It's where we all start and where we all end our days. Having safe, decent, and affordable housing is obviously an essential foundation for any individual to actualize their full potential in our community."
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"Could you just tell us a little bit about your work in affordable housing and economic development and what you hope to accomplish being part of this important committee? Thank you. This is [ORGANIZATION] for me, so thank you so much, and thank you to [ORGANIZATION] and the current ORG1 for considering me and bringing me on board as the newest commissioner."
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"I was in reflection of [TIME] as I was at [ORGANIZATION] offering testimony on the residential infill project. I arrived here in [ORGANIZATION] and got my start actually in affordable housing working with [ORGANIZATION] and the crew at [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION]. So affordable housing was a critical issue for low-income residents and communities of color [ORGANIZATION] and clearly  clearly from this [TIME]'s agenda, items in front of you is also a critical issue [LOCATION] as well."
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"I'm the Executive Director of [ORGANIZATION]. I would love to just offer the thought that it is my belief that housing authorities should be standing shoulder to shoulder with community advocacy groups around the issues of affordable housing and social and racial justice and all of the...  that impact folks both who receive our housing assistance and those who need it. And unfortunately, that dynamic is not common between housing authorities and the advocacy community."
05_16_2018,homeless,"We've diversified our membership and leadership to bring it in line with the demographics of the community which we serve. Finally, because of this funding, we were able to be a productive partner with [ORGANIZATION] to ensure plans for the new shelter on [ORGANIZATION] will make it the best shelter in [ORGANIZATION]. I'm here [ORGANIZATION] to thank you very much for restoring [ORGANIZATION] funds and providing ongoing financial stability to this program and the business districts like [ORGANIZATION] that depend on it."
05_16_2018,houseless,"I've lived in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], and [ORGANIZATION] since [ORGANIZATION]. I've personally witnessed intense harassment of my family and friends of color, police-initiated interactions that end in arrest that were completely unnecessary. I work at FAC0 and FAC1, where there's a mission that serves the houseless, and witness [LOCATION] sweeps, police incidents there."
05_16_2018,homeless; houseless,"And I don't mean policed intervention. I mean things like acute mental health treatment beds at [ORGANIZATION]. By listening to the community, particularly the houseless community, which you referenced, we've actually added a liaison position in the police bureau to work with and help establish policy  around the homeless interactions."
05_16_2018,homeless,"We've asked for data collection, auditing resources, and accountability. All of that also gets funded within the [ORGANIZATION]. And importantly, we've made record investments, substantial increases around homeless service."
05_16_2018,houseless,"And that doesn't include other issues they have had to deal with, which I know you guys know about this stuff, consistent crime related to issues such as car prowls, vandalism, and theft. The growing problem of continual houseless camping and campsite growth, waking up and having to wake up people and ask them, sleeping in the doorway, to move and being verbally threatened. The business license taxes generate more than $100 million DATE0 to fund city services, and as you know, contributed to a nice $22.7 million budget surplus for [LOCATION]."
05_16_2018,houseless,"But what we would like to see is using the surplus more. Much as you said already, to clean up the city, the trash everywhere is not helpful, and it's a little disgusting. To make some better efforts to hold the houseless and transient populations accountable for their actions, we don't really see a lot of that happening."
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"And part of the reason that a lot of people are not here to participate  also express their disapproval of the increase in the police budget, but I would just like to say that  I am again here to demand an immediate freeze on new [ORGANIZATION] hires instead of the 49 new positions proposed, as well as to disarm, defund, and dismantle the police to create real safety in our communities. And I know that we disagree on a lot of the ways that safety is considered by different communities, but I think that...  Part of the issue is that the increases in what you were saying before, the new maybe affordable housing that might be coming in [ORGANIZATION], it's just not enough. It's not enough."
05_16_2018,homeless,"We've increased our contribution to [ORGANIZATION] by at least $3 million, maybe a little bit more. About $5 million. Oh, about $5 million."
05_16_2018,homelessness,"Wow. I didn't get that memo. We're serving more people facing challenges around affordability, eviction, and homelessness than ever."
05_16_2018,homeless,"Unfortunately, what the city and county are actually doing to address houselessness gets lost in distracting debates about [ORGANIZATION] and other well-intentioned but not well-informed approaches. Investing $31.2 million in [ORGANIZATION] will fund the hard work that doesn't make headlines, but does make a critical difference for thousands of our most vulnerable community members. As previously noted, we're also increasing the business license tax for the first time in [ORGANIZATION]."
05_16_2018,homeless,"The rising tide of prosperity in [ORGANIZATION] is clearly not lifting all boats. In fact, as the increasing number of people who are insecure in their housing and becoming homeless demonstrates, things are getting worse, not better, for many people in [ORGANIZATION]. Increasing the [PERSON] now is a great first step toward recognizing how we can divert part of that rising tide to help the people who are struggling to stay afloat and ultimately create a safer, more equitable, and prosperous city for all of us."
05_16_2018,houseless,And there are some wins in the police budget. We're getting two additional behavior health unit teams. We're creating a houseless community engagement liaison position.
05_16_2018,homeless,"I'm very pleased we're shifting $4 million from one time to ongoing resources for [ORGANIZATION], while adding nearly $3 million of new funding for alternative shelter and housing placement. Let's say again what the Mayor has said several times already [ORGANIZATION]. 5,000 people off the streets and into housing in [LOCATION]."
05_16_2018,homeless,"6,000 people who are at risk of becoming homeless and are not. And so while, yes, there are still far too many people, far too many children outside, there are a lot of people who are not because of the work that the mayor has done in leading [ORGANIZATION] and partnering with [ORGANIZATION] in the joint office. I have voted for increased funding for [ORGANIZATION] and for these services [ORGANIZATION] of office, even during [LOCATION], and I'm proud about the...  tens of millions of dollars more that the citizens of [ORGANIZATION], the community of [ORGANIZATION] is willing to dedicate to these services."
05_16_2018,homeless,"But I said when I ran and you elected me to this office to focus on certain priorities, and those priorities are addressing the homeless crisis on our streets.  addressing the housing affordability issue that continues to be a significant challenge to Portlanders. You elected me to improve economic prosperity across the board and to do so in an equitable manner. And you elected me to modernize our police borough and increase the accountability of the police borough."
05_16_2018,homeless,"And I feel sometimes as though when I came here and sat in this chair for the first time, I had died and was suddenly reborn, as though I never had a past.  that followed me into this chair. And I was thinking about this this morning as we were talking about the folks from [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], where I started my volunteer life as an [TIME] volunteer shelter host actually [ORGANIZATION] at this point. And as we've had great conversations and terrific testimony, including [LOCATION], around mental health services, I want to remind people, I used to be the GPE0 Chair."
05_16_2018,affordable housing,Yes. Presentation by [ORGANIZATION] staff on a potential regional affordable housing measure. Very good.
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"Colleagues, as you well know, [ORGANIZATION] is in a housing emergency. In addressing this, we as a council have worked diligently with the community, with advocates and activists to craft policy and incentive development to create more housing stock while simultaneously approving methods  of stabilizing both renters and owners of housing units with a specific emphasis on affordable housing and low-income renters and homeowners. We have approved a historic housing bond, which up to this point is put into our housing pipeline for development."
05_16_2018,homeless,"Over half of the promised housing, nearly 600 units, within [ORGANIZATION] of our five- to [DATE] schedule –  and [ORGANIZATION] continues to aggressively move forward to create affordable rental opportunities. We've also continued production through our use of tax increment finance in urban renewal areas and partnered with area nonprofit organizations to create additional housing for the homeless with a commitment to supportive housing, continued to produce housing for our veterans, [ORGANIZATION] families, and our youth aging out of foster care, and, of course, we look to do a lot more. Our housing emergency is marked by [LOCATION] of 5% or more rent increases in the [ORGANIZATION] area, with a smaller overall rent increase of 2% in [DATE]."
05_16_2018,housing crisis,"You outlined the nature of the housing crisis here in the city of [ORGANIZATION], and as this map shows, it really is also a regional challenge. The growing pains of our region have created rent increases across the metro area, across many other regions across the country as well. So [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] began a process of examining housing  The nature of the problem across the region, what cities like [ORGANIZATION] and others in our jurisdiction are doing to solve the problem, and what role [ORGANIZATION] could play."
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"We know that  much of the need for affordable housing is disproportionately experienced by communities of color, and the history of housing discrimination is long and dates back to the origination of our country. And so with this measure, we must begin to correct for those wrongs, otherwise risk perpetuating those inequities. So absolutely every part of this  framework and all of the work going forward in implementation as a region will be led by racial equity."
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"The constitutional amendment that we'll all be voting on in [ORGANIZATION] is to allow local bonds to be –  used for affordable housing created by non-profit or non-governmental entities. Currently, the Constitution says that if it's a public bond, the public entity has to own that in perpetuity. Is that approximately correct?"
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"So the supportive housing programming will be made possible through partnerships with our, especially our county, our three counties, who will help to partner and leverage those services in conjunction with the future homes. But we absolutely agree, and [ORGANIZATION] is committed to finding that, to, to, Creating those partnerships and committing those resources in conjunction with these future homes that we can ensure that we are serving the community members We intend to and ensure their success in affordable housing great because I my suspicion is that that is a question That will have to be well baked particularly with regard to the county and the support services That are to be provided a commission you [ORGANIZATION]."
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"And that means we're getting people not just off the [STREET] and into that 0 to 30 housing, but out of unaffordable housing and into affordable housing, which then opens up that range of 50 to 80 that we still see a need, a much less great need in that 50 to 80 range. So I guess I'm interested in your thoughts on that and why...  I mean, I think we can do it, but if you think we can't, why? And I guess..."
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"We know where we're planning light rail lines, where we're planning bus rapid transit, and we are able to use the limited federal dollars in the [ORGANIZATION] program to acquire lands and to work with developers to add more density  Historically, that's been the focus. Recently, we've supported the development of over 800 units of affordable housing with the [ORGANIZATION] program. So the concept is, and you were very close to this with the FAC0 proposal, how do we blend resources into that proposal to acquire lands, sometimes acquire buildings, to get ahead of displacement that could occur when values rise after the investment is made?"
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"In addition to the [ORGANIZATION] tax exemption provided by the [ORGANIZATION], this project will receive an exemption of the affordable housing construction excise tax that otherwise would have been due on the affordable units. This project will join the other 24 private sector projects in the inclusionary housing permit approval pipeline, making a minimum of 167 units affordable in otherwise market rate developments. Greetings."
05_16_2018,homeless,"Just a comment. I'd like to thank our staff for all of the work to develop this pilot project with our partners. [ORGANIZATION] facing eviction or who have an eviction are unable to rent in our market, often become homeless if they are able to rent."
05_16_2018,homelessness,"they are usually living in substandard housing. This pilot is especially important to us to gather more information, make sure that we can help folks prevent them from homelessness, and we will be happy to bring back the results of this pilot project to you and would hope that you would see a request to continue this if successful in [ORGANIZATION]. Very good."
03_22_2018,affordable housing,"I mean, we're hearing that there is going to be a slowdown for which –  We'll likely be blamed, but I think it's called the natural cycle of things. And there's a big reference to, you know, capitalizing on inclusionary housing, which, of course, in a CX zone, there's absolutely no guarantee we'll get any affordable housing at this site. It could be many things."
03_22_2018,affordable housing,This is not a development application. So we can't condition any decision that we make based on a particular development. The letters we've gotten from some of the supporters that are in the record  specifically say that their support is conditioned on this being affordable housing subject to inclusionary housing.
03_22_2018,homelessness,"We created a reasonable solution that's being brought to you [ORGANIZATION]. Thank you, Mayor [PERSON], for your support and sponsorship of the amendment. Despite the ongoing deterioration of the neighborhood, crime, and homelessness issues, we believe we can deliver on the community's vision."
03_22_2018,affordable housing,"I'm providing testimony for 1C. I'm a partner at [ORGANIZATION], a co-owner of [ORGANIZATION], and an advocate and activist for dense urban living and affordable housing. If you get on your phone or you jump on a computer and search for [ORGANIZATION], the app will drop a pin 300 feet from [ORGANIZATION]."
03_22_2018,housing crisis,"Before we spend a tremendous amount of money on the design of the building, we need to know for sure that our discussion with [ORGANIZATION] is limited to the contextual conditions of the materials of the building and not how many housing units we are able to build on the property. Ultimately, it is my belief that your goals and our goals are mutually aligned. We are a part of a larger team that is tasked with executing the mission of not only council's goals, but the entire community's to solve a housing crisis."
03_22_2018,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] is larger, so know that there are not that many, a lot of extremely affordable housing areas. [ORGANIZATION] is better known for lawless behavior than our rich history. In short, we're finding that our attempt at perfection is becoming the enemy of good."
03_22_2018,affordable housing,I'll second that. I would simply say that...  i was persuaded i mean i think it's pretty unusual for [ORGANIZATION] to sort of announce ahead of time that they would not approve a proposal that reflect higher height and i think that i'm persuaded by the testimony that in order to maximize the number of affordable housing units in this proposal 200 feet does that
03_22_2018,affordable housing,and i think it does provide a good taper down from the 460 feet north of the proposal to 200 feet  is then 125 feet. So I think that makes a lot of sense. But I do think the additional height and FAR are necessary to maximize the affordable housing units that will be developed under this proposal.
03_22_2018,affordable housing,"I believe the 325-foot height is appropriate as long as it comes with requirements to provide public benefits, which it does, including open space, access to the river, views.  and requirements to allow visual permeability. In addition, the increased height will allow for more flexibility in design and hopefully achieve some of the public benefits we desperately need in the downtown area, including more affordable housing, open space, and access to the river. I vote aye."
05_26_2016,affordable housing,"The work that's moving on affordable housing is absolutely essential for this community. We also have an idea and suggest another task force, which would be to work with the housing code and the residency laws. There are many communities, many families are large in this community."
05_26_2016,homelessness,"And then help us also put appropriate pressure on the private sector and the foundation nonprofit sector to be good partners for what city government does. I was in Mayor [PERSON]'s office not long ago actually talking about homelessness because we were down there visiting a facility that they've done better than what we've done. And he just mentioned in passing something that sort of made me crazy, which is that they wanted to light up one of the bridges."
04_23_2015,soup kitchen,"And just as a reminder, as Commissioner [PERSON] stated, a demolition permit will not be issued until a permit is issued for the replacement proposal, which is to be reviewed under a separate Type 3 land use application. So we have two precedents for Type 4 review. In [ORGANIZATION], we...  [ORGANIZATION] reviewed demolition of the FAC0 building, also known as FAC1, and in that situation, [ORGANIZATION] approved the demolition because they found that the proposed replacement facility, a soup kitchen and low-income housing and other services was the highest and best use of that site."
04_20_2017,homeless,It's pedestrians and the occasional homeless person. So thank you. Great.
04_06_2016,homeless,"So with that, let's take our [ORGANIZATION] communications items starting with 316. Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address [ORGANIZATION] regarding homeless sweeps and civil rights, human rights violations of the homeless. Come on up."
04_06_2016,homeless,I was going to talk about homeless issues. One thing I will bring up is you have a storage bin at FAC0 that's sitting there basically vacant. These things were supposed to be used for homeless people as a day storage thing.
04_06_2016,affordable housing,"Proposal for FAC0 began DATE0. This high school was closed in [LOCATION] due to low enrollment. Within DATE2, the second [ORGANIZATION] was held where it was proposed that FAC1 should be acquired and used for much needed recreation, affordable housing, and other community activities."
04_06_2016,affordable housing,"And I intend to support this amendment should this one pass. The clarifications are that there isn't going to –  The council's intent is that affordable housing should be exempt from the stopgap mitigation payment requirements. So I'm proposing to delete the sentence in the City Code 1150.040.C1B4.  that delete the sentence that says to be exempt from the mitigation requirement in B2, the applicant must demonstrate that the retention requirement of B1 and the tree protection specifications of 030 cannot be met with the proposed development."
04_06_2016,affordable housing,"The reason for that part of this amendment is that to have  The applicant has to demonstrate that would require hiring an arborist. It would require city staff going to verify that. It would delay the process and ultimately result in the same end, because as we had discussions, affordable housing developers are aware that trees are good for their developments."
04_06_2016,affordable housing,"Yeah, good [TIME] mayor and commissioners. My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I'm director of real property at [ORGANIZATION] and  First, I'd like to say that [ORGANIZATION] is very supportive of the city's affordable housing goals."
04_06_2016,affordable housing,"As you alluded to, we're currently working closely with [ORGANIZATION] on a piece of property we're getting ready to develop out in [ORGANIZATION] on the FAC0 line, requiring affordable housing on that site. We're also interested in understanding the new inclusionary zoning laws and how those are going to affect development and working with [ORGANIZATION] to understand how that would affect this site as well. Frankly, due to the quick turnaround between your conversation with the [ORGANIZATION] and this meeting DATE0, we haven't really had a chance to touch base with him on exactly what that conversation was all about, but I do have a meeting with him [PERSON] to get some clarity on that."
04_06_2016,affordable housing,"and what i understand you have placed on the record and that as a condition of council acting on this is that there this this any development here will in fact uh  to conform to the city's affordable housing goals, including the inclusionary housing guidelines to be developed. That's right."
04_06_2016,affordable housing,"Are there questions or concerns you have with that? Again, obviously we have more of this to work out over time and formalities, but it's really important that we have...  on the record an understanding between the city and [ORGANIZATION] that both public agencies are going to be committed to our affordable housing goals as you are in other projects so that that would apply in this case as well and those goals are set now in state law with the inclusionary zoning standard that we have still to process into our own regulations but regardless of where we are in that regulatory development process this is an agreement between the city and the [ORGANIZATION] that between the city and [ORGANIZATION] that  that's going to be the policy regardless of what the formalities are yet at the city in that ordinance development work. Right."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"But if you look at the housing statistics on who's building affordable housing and serving who in the region, if you look at the location of jobs, if you look at transportation, if you look at a number of things, the idea that we are best when the region is successful is coming under attack.  and is being questioned. And I think that when the city of [ORGANIZATION] has a chance to reach out to a regional partner and support something that benefits all of us, and particularly one that supports an important piece of our history, then it is incumbent on us to join arms with our other partners and say, yes, we'll help you. So, again, thanks to our two friends, the former electeds, one of whom has a bridge in her honor, for joining us."
04_01_2015,homeless; houseless,"Our concern is something that happened recently with the smoking ban in our parks. We believe that if that was before the ballot measure, we would have opposed this ballot measure solely on that. Our concern is that people that are houseless or homeless are going to be profiled –  under the guise of smoking a cigarette to be excluded from the parks."
04_01_2015,homeless,"Go ahead. We think that...  This could be used to hurt people, and the [STREET] this council has handled the homeless question and people on the streets is a disgrace, and we see this as a continuation. Mayor, you wanted to say something?"
04_01_2015,homeless,"About the encampment in back of FAC0, I hope the area isn't, as it was sold to the  From the public schools to [ORGANIZATION], I hope it isn't made into a park, but instead used for an encampment for the homeless. And I spoke [ORGANIZATION] with your aide, [ORGANIZATION], and apparently something has to be changed in the park. what it was in the intent of the sale, and then after that's done, it can be used for that encampment."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"Aye. Okay, let's move to 340. require the identification and acquisition of rights to develop affordable housing on a site in [ORGANIZATION] that will fully achieve all affordable housing goals in the district mr. [ORGANIZATION] mayor"
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"I want to offer a little context for how we got to this [STREET]. There has been over [ORGANIZATION] or to [LOCATION], a very robust community discussion about,  centering on how the city fulfills commitments that were made back in DATE2 concerning affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]. And while originally there were a package of amendments were offered by you, Mayor, to effectively right-size urban renewal, this issue about housing came to dominate the discussions around the Fourth Amendment to the [ORGANIZATION] Urban Renewal Plan."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"So the Fourth Amendment, which we'll be voting on in a little bit,  specifically calls out a development on what has been identified as parcel three and identifies the funding to make a substantial down payment towards some existing affordable housing goals. This resolution commits the council to a second development within a specified time frame with funding to complete the,  the goals that were set for zero to 60, that is people at 60% of MFI and below, the people that are currently struggling the most in our market, particularly people at the zero to 30 range, that would complete our commitment at that level and allow us to begin to stretch to other commitments that were made around affordable housing. There was some consideration given to seeking to boost the numbers at FAC0 to fit as many units as possible."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"It doesn't say that we're going to be finished in meeting affordable housing goals. And as additional resources are generated, we will continue to make progress meeting our then goals and the new goals that we've established. But I will put this in context."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"At the time that the Fourth Amendment was originally proposed, there were approximately somewhere between $7 and $9 million of [ORGANIZATION] available for affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]. And that doesn't buy much. The action that I hope we take [ORGANIZATION] will ensure at least $47 million is allocated to two specific developments within [ORGANIZATION], down payments on meeting goals that we established in [LOCATION] and have not yet fulfilled, and putting us, I think, on a forward path to do even more."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"The second be it resolved...  paragraph now says that through second site acquisition and development, [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] will fully achieve all affordable housing goals [ORGANIZATION] as defined by the DATE0 [ORGANIZATION] Rural Area Housing Development Strategy. I think that... What?"
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"But again, in an excess of caution, given that we have a limited amount of money, we have other needs in the district for transportation, parks at all, I'm proposing that the be it resolved be amended to read. Now, therefore, be it resolved that through second site acquisition and development, [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] will use up to $47 million in [ORGANIZATION] revenue towards achieving affordable housing goals in [ORGANIZATION], as defined by et cetera. So I'll second the amendment, Mayor, for purpose of discussion."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"And I also appreciate the clarification because there was, I think, a drafting error in my resolution. There was no [STREET] we were going to fully achieve all affordable housing goals on the second site. And I think we've become so accustomed to thinking in terms of the most pressing goals as 0 to 60 that we use it interchangeably with affordable housing goals."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"When I hear the term affordable housing... In my mind, what that generates is the average earning capacity of a person in [ORGANIZATION], which is about $60,000 a year. And if you take the affordable housing, that becomes a percentage of what they pay."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"So it could be...  as much as $50,000, $60,000, if they have to pay the full amount, depending on how much income they have coming in. I would like to see the wording change to low-income housing instead of affordable housing. And that has at least the implications—  that we really care about people that are struggling."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"When you say the people that are struggling in [ORGANIZATION], and if you base it on $60,000 a year, that excludes a lot of people. So if you were to change the wording on this stuff to say low-income housing, that would incorporate people that are making minimum wage that we all seem to be really worried about. And I find it offensive when I hear politicians use the phrase affordable housing because it's a con phrase."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"So I want to have this a little bit better understanding on your timing on committing yourself to a purchase agreement on the additional parcels. Another issue I have on the affordable housing issues is that I have a real issue on setting height restrictions on people that want to,  build additional units for affordable housing. I want developers to have the freedom to come in with ideas for additional affordable housing units and having their height restrictions negotiated upon them doing that for the public good."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"If we want to restrict them with the [ORGANIZATION]'s, try to add additional cost to them. If we try to restrict them in other areas, the developers are going to step back and say, it doesn't make any sense to me to look at this time. I don't have any interest in affordable housing."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"We have to have the understanding that it's more advantageous to have people in housing than out on sidewalks. Again, we need to keep looking at those areas for the developers to continue to build projects, to continue to focus on affordable housing, again,  and be offered incentives on height restrictions to let them be able to develop their projects and offer more housing and not be shut down due to the limitations of heights. Thank you."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"All right. i'm [ORGANIZATION] representing [ORGANIZATION] the league appreciates commissioner [PERSON]'s efforts to give the public more certainty about meeting the [ORGANIZATION] affordable housing goals unfortunately the resolution does not go far enough the actions described will not fully achieve all the district's affordable housing goals the constrained funding model in the urban renewal plan applies to the first 3 000 units  Once that point has been reached, the comprehensive plan applies, and future housing development should match the income profile of the city as a whole. There are currently about 2,500 units, so we are fast approaching that point."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"It was clear from the beginning that because the need for infrastructure, affordable housing, and parks was so great, and the funds limited, it would be especially important to require commitments for land and infrastructure improvements from the property owners benefiting from the substantial public investment. It is not too late to make that happen. [ORGANIZATION] should start by withholding approval of the amendment until agreements with [PERSON] and ORG2 for housing sites, parks, and streets are in [STREET]."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,[ORGANIZATION] should transfer ownership of half of block 33 to the city for affordable housing development in lieu of repaying the $2 million in housing money it owes. [ORGANIZATION] needs to do its part to contribute to the district's housing and infrastructure needs. The ORG1 campus is situated on 20 acres of donated land and it is tax exempt.
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"Surely, [ORGANIZATION] can spare one acre for housing that would serve its lower paid workers. The remainder of the development capacity on parcel 3 should be reserved for affordable housing, particularly for units below 30% MFI. Given the [ORGANIZATION]'s lackluster performance on affordable housing to date, there is little confidence among the public that any more sites will be secured."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] has been held up as a model of success. In that case, [ORGANIZATION] were adopted concurrently. For the most part, the developer and city held up their ends of the bargain, and in return for city infrastructure improvements, land was made available for parks and affordable housing."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"We're at a [STREET] because we didn't secure land early that there are few options for us and I think [ORGANIZATION] articulated what we really should be doing in the future. The resolution is seen as a win, but it really isn't. In [ORGANIZATION], the framework plan for [ORGANIZATION] was adopted, and it outlined what the affordable housing goals for the district would be if we were to follow the longstanding affordable housing policy of the city of [ORGANIZATION]."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"And that policy was something that was exemplified in the implementation of [ORGANIZATION]. We recognized that the infrastructure needs were greater in [LOCATION] and through a public process that was huge and long. We actually adopted a constrained funding model for affordable housing, constrained goals."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"In [ORGANIZATION], the Seventh Amendment to [LOCATION] really put Block 33 as the primary real estate focus for achieving affordable housing. And at that time, [ORGANIZATION] purchased parking units, non-existent parking stalls, but parking stalls that were to be developed there. In [LOCATION], the Eighth Amendment revised that focus to be both Block 33 and Block 49."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"And [ORGANIZATION] actually acquired land from FAC0 investors, $5 million, and then it did a sole source development agreement with them. They acquired air rights from FAC0 investors and did a first right of refusal that they could develop the affordable housing above FAC1. Okay."
04_01_2015,homelessness,"along with other former [ORGANIZATION] and ORG1 staff and housing advocates. And, you know, we're here because we care deeply about [ORGANIZATION] being a city with opportunities for everyone, opportunities for people of all income levels, stages of life, to live, to work, and play in these diverse neighborhoods, including the new and emerging ones like [ORGANIZATION]. I'm also here as a volunteer on the ORG2 housing work group that's been working with the city and county staff over [ORGANIZATION] to recommend strategies to reduce homelessness in our community."
04_01_2015,homeless; affordable housing,"[TIME], [ORGANIZATION], who works on homeless issues for [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON], said,  was telling me, you know, it's taken veterans, sorry, PERSON2 comes back with me sometimes and I get a little emotional. It's taken veterans [ORGANIZATION] to find housing, even with vouchers, sorry, and down payments, because there just aren't enough affordable housing units."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"At 200 units an acre, that's a total of 520 units, which is basically three acres of land. You've got two acres of partial three if you choose to develop that all for affordable housing. You're currently in negotiations with another property owner for another acre of land."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"So I absolutely believe if we have the three sites, we can do it. If you don't want to use all of FAC0, the only site the city still has left –  for a full affordable housing project, then you need one more site. And I agree with [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] that FAC1 is a good [STREET] to go."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,and I know that a lot of that it's going to go for Low-income or affordable housing and I think that's great. I have a  strong feelings about the need for having that in the city.
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"Well, we don't have to give you a hypothetical. The only other affordable housing development in your neighborhood is operated by [ORGANIZATION]. And it's a little bit to the south of where you live currently."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"But, yes, FAC0 is the first parcel that will be developed for affordable housing. So FAC0 includes the land that's currently empty as well as the substation land. Is that right?"
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"Utilize parcel three for maximum development of affordable housing. Stick to the goal committed to in [ORGANIZATION], that housing after the first 3,000 units will match the income profile of the city as a whole. And to do this, acquire sites now."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"As you know, the city is currently 270 units behind the promised production of affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]. And by the time FAC0 is developed and 4,000 units total have been built in the district, the shortfall would be 570 units less whatever is developed on FAC0. To develop 570 homes, we need approximately three acres of land."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"If all of parcel 3 is used for affordable housing, just one more acre would be required to reach existing targets. If only half of parcel 3 is used for affordable housing and the balance for other housing, we would need two more acres. Those sites should be secured now before they become even more expensive."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"The data shows that currently we are short 23,000 units of housing affordable to people below 30% of median income. and another 600 units that were short for those [DATE] and 50 percent MFI. However, there is a surplus of 45,000 units for households [DATE], and the excess of affordable housing increases as we go higher up the income scale."
04_01_2015,homeless,"We can get the rest of the development money down the [STREET]. And we can supplement [ORGANIZATION] and general fund with federal funds that include those rent subsidy contracts that can write down the rents through project-based Section 8, vouchers for homeless veterans, and a new batch of [ORGANIZATION] vouchers. In its current form, I would not personally approve, support approving the urban renewal amendment."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"Some have been surprised at that, saying, well, there's $47 million in additional affordable housing money. Why wouldn't you support that? But to be clear, the net increase in tax increment for affordable housing is only $3 million, not $47 million."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"Good morning. Thanks for taking all this testimony [ORGANIZATION]. I'll try to be brief because you've heard a lot already, but [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], owner-manager at [ORGANIZATION], and many other affordable apartments around the city, and affordable housing to define it, which is important."
04_01_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"I'm the Director of [ORGANIZATION]. [TIME], I guess I just want to add to the conversation two points from the perspective of my current work and the perspective of my past work. Currently, leading up [ORGANIZATION], our work, we're an organization of 75 local nonprofits working to address the affordable housing crisis before our city and [LOCATION] region."
04_01_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"And my first assignment was to convene a survey of how other cities are funding affordable housing with local revenue strategies. Clearly, federal resources, state resources are not going far enough. Everywhere, cities around the country like ours are in the midst of this housing crisis."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"And what could we do? And unfortunately, what we find is a list of revenue mechanisms that are preempted in [ORGANIZATION], preempted at the state level. And here we are with the [ORGANIZATION] set aside, which was an enormous win [ORGANIZATION] for affordable housing advocates and has brought a lot of revenue, $150 million to [PERSON] for affordable housing development."
04_01_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"Unfortunately, that revenue is limited to use in only our urban renewal areas. And so here we are working to find new solutions for affordable housing because clearly this conversation is evidence of the fact that our [ORGANIZATION] set-aside, while wonderful, is not going the distance to meet the need of our affordable housing crisis, of our 20,000-unit shortage in the [ORGANIZATION] area for families and individuals with less than 30 percent income. We have a lot of work to do."
04_01_2015,housing crisis,"But the [ORGANIZATION] set-aside is our opportunity to do it, and the urban renewal districts are the [STREET], the opportunity for us to implement this strategy. And so I'm here to ask and encourage and thank you for finding ways to make this resource go the distance while it's the only resource we have available. And then the second point I want to bring to the conversation is from the perspective of my previous work where I was at [ORGANIZATION] pilot project for [ORGANIZATION] and cascade you behavioral health care for [LOCATION] before that working with people with very low incomes in the midst of a housing crisis."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"but we know that the conversation is the same, and the need is the same and we need more affordable housing priorities here in the city. And I appreciate the fact that the situation that we're in now is is the product of. past decisions that we may not be able to overcome."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"We have to do better on housing. our end at [ORGANIZATION], we hear on the renters' rights hotline astronomical rent increases. And there is such a dire need for people to find and keep affordable housing."
04_01_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"How successful are these investments if the people that live and work and contribute to the city don't have enough opportunity to live there? And...  We really can't build our [STREET] out of this housing crisis with mostly private development. The more private development we build, that actually creates more of a need for affordable housing."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"And we, as a community, can look forward not only now but in [ORGANIZATION] and see what we can do about prioritizing affordable housing. Thank you very much. Thank you."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"I am just begging you to reserve this very critical tool. Like it or not, it is a critical tool that the city has to finance affordable housing. Use it wisely."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"This resolution memorializes the diligent efforts that have occurred and will occur in the future by both [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]. Thank you.  to identify an additional parcel of land to achieve our affordable housing goals for [ORGANIZATION]. As we all know, and has been so eloquently stated [TIME], the need for affordable housing has never been greater."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"Rents are rising rapidly, and many [ORGANIZATION]ers and [ORGANIZATION] families are being priced out of our city. The [ORGANIZATION] area offers a very opportunity-rich area for affordable housing to be. It's rich in transportation."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"uh it's got good schools that people young people will go to in that area and it meets all of our criteria for high opportunity area so we are determined to make sure that we meet our goals and hopefully we'll exceed our goals on affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION] pleased to i thank commissioner PERSON0 for his leadership on this resolution and everybody he also thanked previously as well hi  [PERSON]? Well, Mayor, just a point of privilege, and I apologize because my handwriting is like a doctor's handwriting and sometimes I can't even read it. The reason that [ORGANIZATION] were at the table and the [ORGANIZATION] was at the table and that we were able to do a little bit of a stretch in this work is because the mayor of our city said it was important to him personally."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"So I'm very pleased with this amendment. It shows true leadership by Commissioner [PERSON] to ensure that  affordable housing gets going soon, and then that there's more of it coming. And I would hope that at least one more site will be there."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"This resolution, I think, does give us the additional clarity about our implementing strategies for affordable housing. The specificity that [ORGANIZATION] came here and asked us for, I think, is now before us, and I'm very pleased to support this and vote aye. Thank you."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"The council obviously has heard extensively from the public on this package, which returns $800 million in assessed value to local taxing jurisdictions.  increases the resources for affordable housing, and advances the implementation of our affordable housing goals and helps achieve the potential of new station areas in [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]. Let me make some specific comments about a few of these areas. Regarding [ORGANIZATION], the area around [ORGANIZATION] is a problem."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"And with regard to FAC0, I just wanted to say that we do still need some more investments for transportation. I wish we had no transportation needs and we can put all of the money into affordable housing. But despite the fact that we have a tram, despite the fact we have a streetcar, we also have a complete mess at the intersection of FAC1 and FAC2 and [PERSON], which will get much worse as development proceeds and there's more travel there."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"So affordable housing is a critical need for the entire city. But unfortunately, we do have to save some of the revenue to deal with other issues, including parks and transportation. Anyway, thanks to my colleagues."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"The inclusion of the land in [ORGANIZATION],  And a firm guarantee that [ORGANIZATION], ORG1-owned land will be affordable housing. I think ensures that we will be able to bring another affordable housing project to inner southeast [ORGANIZATION]. I'm pleased to vote aye."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"I do appreciate the effort by the Commissioner [PERSON] to add an affordable housing requirement, and yet the amendment is unclear and doesn't specify exactly what that means. There's not enough evidence, in my opinion, to support an expansion of the district in this [STREET]. I was quite persuaded by the testimony from [ORGANIZATION] and the other neighborhood representatives that in addition to [ORGANIZATION], or perhaps instead of, and having a new urban renewal district along FAC0, that would have made more sense adding property along FAC1 or along [LOCATION]."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"So roll call vote, please, on FAC0. PERSON0? I've been on this council long enough to remember when we adopted the education urban renewal district, and once upon a time I had high hopes for how we might spend the affordable housing dollars in that part of town."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"We're on 336? Mm-hmm. Yeah, I would like to, I don't think [ORGANIZATION] is here or anyone from [ORGANIZATION], so I would like to at least acknowledge that because of their advocacy, we did bump up the target for the set-aside for affordable housing under this original amendment above 30%, which as we know was always a floor, to a blended rate of 42%."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"And that was because, in part, because [ORGANIZATION] said that there was such an urgency, they wanted to see more money and they wanted to see the money front-loaded. And so I'm deeply appreciative that [ORGANIZATION] and his leadership at the commission led to the city adopting that framework and significantly increasing the dollars that will be allocated for affordable housing for the life of this district. All right."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"I have been very concerned all along from back when I was on [ORGANIZATION] when [ORGANIZATION] was under consideration that there are so many competing needs, and indeed there continue to be competing needs in this amendment. The problem that the advocates highlighted immediately was the deficit in affordable housing, and I applaud Commissioner [PERSON] for diving in and working so hard to identify the solution on Block 3, and I'm very happy to support the proposed funding for the projects at $47 million. Building on the amendment that ORG1 adopted in [ORGANIZATION] under Commissioner [PERSON]'s leadership to increase the set-aside for affordable housing in [LOCATION] to 36%."
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"And particularly for affordable housing, as well as market-raised housing, there needs to be an active park in the district. Housing advocates, [ORGANIZATION] and the [ORGANIZATION], recognize and support this need. And again, system development charges will provide some revenue, but it won't be enough."
05_06_2015,affordable housing,"And then if you look through kind of the actual feedback, what people wrote down on sticky notes or what they communicated to us in our meetings,  You can see there's some common themes that relate to affordability, affordable housing. Maybe when we get to some discussion on this, we can talk about how we should be thinking about our role in affordable housing, but currently it's not a core part of our work, but I know there's a strong sense that [ORGANIZATION] should be more involved in But then there's also this there's a series of more kind of how we do our work around committee involvement, around making sure that we're aligned with the efforts from other plans and that people like the fact that we're thinking holistically."
05_06_2015,affordable housing,"I mean, you can do a lot of things, but I'm not sure you can be held accountable for boosting that by 40 percent. Or making a significant dent in homeownership, particularly when market forces and things like new underwriting guidelines make it much harder to get people into homeownership, maybe making the affordable housing rental agenda more compelling. Or the one that I think really jumped out at me is this idea that in [ORGANIZATION] you're reduced by half the number of households in high poverty neighborhoods without promoting displacement."
05_06_2015,affordable housing,"For example, [ORGANIZATION] we completed our housing advocacy training. This is a project funded by [ORGANIZATION]. It brought community elders together in a series of five sessions to explore the issue of affordable housing."
05_06_2015,affordable housing,"DATE0 we receive calls from older adults who cannot find affordable housing, who are being priced out of their apartments or living in unsafe environments. We wanted to explore the range of options available in our community and partnered with [ORGANIZATION] in this exploration. We took this group to the state legislature to speak with their representatives about the issue and concluded [LOCATION] with 40 people on the Fair Housing Discrimination Tour, which looks at the history of housing in our community through the lens of race."
05_28_2015,homeless,"But I find that [ORGANIZATION] is in a very big hurry to demolish and destroy, whether it's very livable homes and make more homeless people, or destroy our reservoirs, the best water system in this country. Water is life. Do not destroy our reservoirs."
05_22_2019,affordable housing,"Could you call the next individual, please? 447, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding proposal to convert FAC0 to affordable housing. I see [PERSON]."
05_22_2019,houseless,"Because what I know is that for [ORGANIZATION], African Americans and other people of color did not feel welcome as part of this celebration. But we're moving forward, and we're moving forward in a very positive [STREET]. I also want to say that I know that houseless community members dread [LOCATION] because they get pushed to the sides and edges of our city."
05_22_2019,homelessness,My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I manage the city's homelessness and urban camping impact reduction program. I'd like to apologize for bringing an emergency ordinance [ORGANIZATION].
05_22_2019,homelessness,"We now have a clearer and more data-informed goal of reducing the impact of unsanctioned encampments. The current scope is outdated and needs to better reflect the [STREET] that our work has evolved over time and has proven most effective in our operations and engagement with individuals experiencing homelessness. So, I view this as an opportunity for us to evaluate a number of different companies and to write new contracts that require specialized training  that we have incorporated."
05_22_2019,houseless,"It's clear to me that... Dealing with this issue in the individually That we cannot expect that we would have up to 25 million dollars being spent on cleaning up campsites without detailed public engagement and involvement As when you spoke with me DATE0 I mentioned to you that I'm very concerned that there is  does not appear to be a path for people who are houseless [LOCATION] to be employed to help with this process. And so I have a vested interest in making sure that if we're going to give this contract out, that we are providing the most humane service we can possibly provide."
05_22_2019,homelessness,"We, anything that is reasonably assumed to be of utility and or value, which is vague language from the Anderson Agreement, we kind of iron that out with the work, with the assistance of [ORGANIZATION] to try to define that a little bit more clearly. We store items that are property or useful to individuals experiencing homelessness for [ORGANIZATION] in a centralized location two blocks away from a [ORGANIZATION] station. Very good."
05_22_2019,homeless,"I think that would really need to be an amendment to this ordinance to say that if this ordinance passes,  the review report for the expenditure that will be approved, we'll have a public comment period. So $5 million on a [ORGANIZATION] scope, $1 million for remediation, whatever, assistance in the homeless camp cleanup. One thing that pragmatically [ORGANIZATION], I think he's really diligent, I think he even made it to one of PERSON1 town halls out at ORG0 DATE1,  But here's the thing, once you budget that million dollars, how many times do you want to switch it off?"
05_22_2019,homeless,"Because we know that the homeless problem is extensive. Severe poverty, severe situations, a number of sites. So either you're going to have to allot it [ORGANIZATION], and homeless people will just be free after [LOCATION], because you'll have spent your [ORGANIZATION] allotment."
05_22_2019,homeless,"or you'll have spent the million dollars in [ORGANIZATION] and the homeless people will be able to experience a reprieve. So I don't know if that specific language you're gonna ask for each of the individual RFP responders to address a million dollars for campsite cleanup  talked about in a silo where we're not talking about how we're going to have less homeless campers is not, I think, generating a lot of confidence by your constituents. Thank you."
05_22_2019,homeless,"I agree with [ORGANIZATION]. Let's take that 25 million and put it into permanent supportive housing that has state licensed case management because unlike...  [ORGANIZATION], which says 40% of the people are disabled, it's 90%. Now, we realize you can't admit that because that would be admitting catastrophic failure to house people who are disabled, but when you have ORG1 contractors who cherry pick, you get the most disabled people on the [STREET]."
05_22_2019,homeless,"And, you know, nine beds added for behavioral health is like nothing. If you want to talk about the FAC0 building, never did you ask a disabled person for their input in how to make that work. I know, but I'm just saying $25 million to harass homeless people who are without housing because the state or the city or the county messed up in providing that housing is wrong."
05_22_2019,homeless,"Are there any further questions of [ORGANIZATION]? I have two. So [ORGANIZATION], you just heard some testimony and I hear this testimony frequently that what your job is is to harass the homeless."
05_22_2019,homelessness,A lot of them have experienced homelessness themselves. And so they take that living experience to inform their engagement with folks. I think it's been pretty helpful.
05_22_2019,homelessness,"If so, how many? There, to my knowledge, since I've been working doing this for the city of [ORGANIZATION], there have been zero arrests for a Title 14 infraction, which is a prohibition of structures in public property. There have been arrests of individuals experiencing homelessness for other behaviors, but I don't  To my knowledge, there have been zero tickets written or arrests made for a Title 14."
05_22_2019,housing crisis; affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] commissioned studies regarding the impact of fees on development and the impact of frontage improvements on property value. I wholeheartedly support these fee increases and permit types. However, in light of our ongoing affordable housing crisis, I'm proposing [ORGANIZATION] subsidize the fees for development review, building plan review, and temporary [STREET] route use for affordable housing developments."
05_22_2019,housing crisis; affordable housing,"I have asked [ORGANIZATION] to create a 50% reduction in fees programmatically for affordable housing development and low-income owner-occupied residences. A lesser-known fact of our housing crisis is that 25% of homeowners are cost-burdened by their own housing expenses, and that is bad news for the city, and we want to do everything we can to alleviate their burden. The affordable housing reduction would apply to properties where the low-income occupants are someone other than the current property owner and either selling to a qualified low-income..."
05_22_2019,affordable housing,"We continue with a number of affordable housing subsidies, which include a prioritization of those types of permits. We give them assistance at the counter and when they're in concept review. And our systems development charge, LTIC...  and transportation demand management fees are subsidized, as well as our streetcar service has a low income fare."
05_22_2019,homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION] hearing, we'll also convene as [ORGANIZATION] on [LOCATION] to officially adopt the City's budget. I'm proud to submit my proposed budget for DATE2. This budget reflects on my commitment to housing and the homelessness crisis in our community, supporting equitable outcomes and fostering equitable prosperity in our community, fiscal sustainability and intergenerational equity in the [STREET] we support and fund programs,  creating clean and safe communities, and improving and streamlining city processes and constituent response."
05_22_2019,homelessness,"And though my class may not have been able to stay here this long, we've been working on a project called [ORGANIZATION], where we identify a problem in our community and find a public policy service-based solution to it. We chose homelessness and hygiene as our problem, and we've been researching this topic for [ORGANIZATION]. According to ORG1, in [LOCATION] there was an estimated 14,476 people experiencing homelessness on DATE2 in [ORGANIZATION]."
05_22_2019,homeless,"If you and your clothes are dirty, it can be harder to get a job and therefore harder to get off the streets. Everything sort of goes downhill from there and [ORGANIZATION]'s homeless crisis continues. We're here to ask you to vote yes to the proposed hygiene package on the budget that would allocate $1 million to funding for hygiene."
05_22_2019,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION], in her report for the mayor, City of [ORGANIZATION], outlines three possible places this money could go. These hygiene centers she describes will help people get ways to shower and to wash their clothes and go to the bathroom. It would be highly beneficial to our homeless population because it'll help them wash their clothes and therefore reduce trash."
05_22_2019,homelessness,"Because a lot of the trash produced by people experiencing homelessness is dirty or wet clothes. As with no [STREET] to wash or dry the clothes, it's easier to just dump them. It would also give them showers and safe places to go to the bathroom, which would help them get jobs, prevent the spread of disease, and reduce the time and money the city needs to spend to clean up trash and human waste."
05_22_2019,homeless; homelessness,The money from this proposed budget could put a big dent in the hygiene problems that [ORGANIZATION]'s homeless population experiences and help make the city cleaner. Your vote would give us a big opportunity for us to help people experiencing homelessness because they can't solve this problem themselves and we have the power to help them. Their problems are our problems too.
05_22_2019,homelessness,"Hello, my name is [ORGANIZATION]. I am a case manager for transition projects and proud member of a vast me local 88 My colleagues including [PERSON] had to leave unfortunately our unions and negotiations [ORGANIZATION], but of course we receive public funding and Are dependent on that in order for? for better conditions [ORGANIZATION] staff do vital work with vulnerable populations that much of our society rather ignored and forget about and  People who would rather dismiss homelessness as a personal failing, the result of a lack of moral character, rather than something that could happen to them."
05_22_2019,homeless; homelessness,"They don't want to consider that they themselves could be one mispayment, one medical emergency, one family crisis away from becoming homeless themselves. At [ORGANIZATION], we see the reality of homelessness up close. We see the toll on people's mental health, their physical and spiritual well-being, from not only being deprived of money and resources, but robbed of the very dignity."
05_22_2019,homeless; homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION] workers are out there saving lives [ORGANIZATION], first and foremost by helping people out of the dangers they experience on the streets, but also by giving CPR and first aid, administering [ORGANIZATION] for drug overdoses, and de-escalating people experiencing mental health crises. I myself once saved a man from choking,  For all the work we do for homelessness, it's a sad irony that as many as one in five [ORGANIZATION] employees have themselves experienced homelessness while working with this agency. Just as society undervalues the lives of homeless people themselves, so too do they undervalue the work of those who serve the homeless."
05_22_2019,homeless,"So I just want to say thank you, and please, I urge you to fund [ORGANIZATION] better. Thank you. Thank you."
05_22_2019,homeless,"My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I'm a [INSTITUTION] teacher. Before teaching in public schools, I worked as a social worker with runaway and homeless kids."
05_22_2019,homelessness,"All right. Hello mayor and commissioners My name is [ORGANIZATION] and I work for transitional projects where their mission is to trans help people as they transition from homelessness to housing  I'm in a unique role as someone who has worked in a number of their programs that you fund, and I now oversee and direct my agency's equity and inclusion and peer mentor efforts and have firsthand experience of how your investments and support impact the lives of people experiencing homelessness. I see this in action [ORGANIZATION]."
05_22_2019,homelessness,"I live and breathe this work. Your investment allowed a participant to go from homelessness to shelter,  to surviving and addressing their mental health needs, to achieving and maintaining housing stability. And now for [ORGANIZATION], I'm pleased to say that they are currently employed as a property manager."
05_22_2019,homelessness,That's right. Your effort led someone from homelessness to property management. Thank you for your ongoing investment and support of housing initiatives and in the homelessness work.
03_08_2018,affordable housing,"people living in affordable housing, you know,  you know, that somehow you could word this so that it would encompass all of that in a very simple manner. And that's exactly what you've done with this amendment. And I just can't say enough about how appreciative I am to have a city council that really is listening and really accepting the feedback that comes before them."
03_03_2016,affordable housing,"And impacts, we had concerns to...  you know, affordable housing and to minor issues that may be affected by a homeowner. But we did, at [DATE], really look at tree preservation. The other part, I want to thank [ORGANIZATION] for giving us some information."
03_03_2016,affordable housing,"So I wanted to mention that I, too, was one of the people who was on the task force that spent DATE0, [LOCATION], putting together this plan that led to the Title XI agreement. new code, and it has changed a little over the time, and I appreciate the fact that you're trying to fix one of the problems that seems to have come up as one of the major stumbling blocks as it went forward. I did want to say one thing about the affordable housing issue."
03_03_2016,affordable housing,"People ...  need both livability and affordability. I live in [ORGANIZATION], which is where we have a lot of affordable housing, and I live in housing that's relatively affordable compared to the rest of the city. And one of the criteria my husband and I had was that we wanted a property with mature trees, and we were willing to give up some other things if we could have some mature trees."
06_03_2015,homelessness,"But, you know, I look at oversight in many areas, and there's other oversights that boards that need to be put together to strengthen, well, should I say,  Review new measures to help the city. And I think the city of [ORGANIZATION] should create a board through your office in homelessness. And I'm sure, as you stated last time, you're doing all you can to do that."
06_03_2015,homelessness,and i know we said we wasn't going to discuss that but this is all connected and i just simply want to invite all of the citizens of [ORGANIZATION] to stand with us under FAC0 on DATE0 at [TIME] to  address this issue of homelessness.
06_03_2015,affordable housing,"Meeting climate action plan, affordable housing, economic development, and most urgently reduces the public's involuntary exposure to hazardous materials. Thank you for including that. When [ORGANIZATION] met with [ORGANIZATION], 43 formally signed on to our resolution, but in none of those meetings was deconstruction ever controversial."
03_21_2018,homelessness,"In cities such as [ORGANIZATION], this translates into a GDP increase that could be as much as 13%. With women-owned businesses, these economic gains are also not limited to those at the very top. One of our other participants, [ORGANIZATION], a nut butter company, works with local nonprofits to provide jobs to women transitioning out of homelessness."
03_21_2018,affordable housing,"There was an article that was published with, this was [ORGANIZATION] looking at, well, potentially, its economic displacement. we would have to do a lot more work in order to understand this better. And of course that brings in questions about our neighborhoods, affordable housing, tie that all back into transportation, and then neighborhood development and change over time."
03_21_2018,affordable housing,"It's tradition for us actually, Commissioner [PERSON] was there [ORGANIZATION]. The audience does a vote on their favorite projects. But we know that some of our other projects, by the [STREET], are affordable housing, we're working on disaster resilience,  That's also, we're working with [ORGANIZATION] on that."
03_21_2018,affordable housing,"The ordinance is adopted. Next item, 278. 278. Approve interim use of the multiple unit limited tax exemption program to capture opportunities for affordable housing and housing developments not subject to inclusionary housing and amend the administrative rules."
03_21_2018,housing crisis,"Colleagues, the multiple unit limited tax exemption or multi is a proven tool that we can use to get affordable units into the pipeline in the near term. We're in a housing crisis, as you're all aware, and the need is immediate. Not doing anything means that all of the units that are under consideration, that is the 10,000 units in the pipeline that are in the pipeline prior to the inclusionary housing ordinance coming into effect, all of those units will be market rate included."
03_21_2018,housing crisis,in the absence of this multi-program being approved. Not doing anything means that we lose the opportunity to ensure that we are taking the housing crisis as seriously as possible. I've worked with my colleagues to find what we believe is the sweet spot on the cap on individual projects.
03_21_2018,affordable housing,"So I'm concerned about the effect on affordable housing. It seems contrary to reason that we would build more market rate and how it would affect, but it obviously creates an environment where we can leverage affordable housing and the competition works to [STREET] down prices at some point. With that said..."
03_21_2018,affordable housing,"Thank you, Mayor. As Commissioner [PERSON] just said, I know we all are concerned about the ongoing provision of housing in general and affordable housing. I have some questions about this particular proposal."
03_21_2018,affordable housing,"We heard some sobering statistics [ORGANIZATION] when [ORGANIZATION] presented at budget time, and Madam Director, you'll correct me if I get this wrong, but –  we've identified that there's at least 24,000 units of deeply affordable housing that were short in the marketplace. And we're also seeing a lot of so-called luxury housing coming online that's out of the reach of middle-income working families and the poor. So when there's a market mismatch, it seems to me it is –  incumbent on government to act to remedy that, and the market is not working great for lower-income people."
03_21_2018,housing crisis,"So it is our job to take some action. As my colleagues know, I am very focused on people of very modest means, because I think if we had a dollar to spend, I would always prefer to create a subsidy for someone who's really struggling on the margins. But the truth is our housing crisis is affecting people throughout the spectrum."
03_21_2018,affordable housing,"I mean, I don't want to make a claim that's not entirely true, but we're roughly giving an abatement. We're giving an abatement that's roughly equivalent to what we might invest in affordable housing, which is about $100,000 a unit. However, we'd expect a much longer affordability period than [ORGANIZATION]."
03_21_2018,housing crisis,"So I think this is a very good addition to our portfolio of affordability. This will not solve the housing crisis, nor has anybody proposed that it would. But from my perspective, if we want affordability built now,  the best [STREET] to look at is at all those projects that are going through the permitting process, that are going through their pre-development phase, that are ready to actually be built and have some of those units, which could come on [ORGANIZATION], be affordable, as opposed to when we work through new housing projects."
03_21_2018,affordable housing,"So we're just clarifying within the code that the fees that will be charged are going to be part of an [ORGANIZATION] fee. This allows us also to look at ways in which we can have one rate for market rate dwellings and one for affordable rate. With [ORGANIZATION] adopting a new low-income fare, this might provide an opportunity to achieve both our transit goals and also our affordable housing goals."
03_21_2018,affordable housing,"So this package is trying to marry those two things as well. So we're taking the new codes, which didn't include inclusionary housing. They included some different forms of bonuses and incentives for affordable housing and marry them to the inclusionary housing package so that it all works well together in the long run moving forward."
03_21_2018,affordable housing,"And that's related to the map refinement project, which you heard about [ORGANIZATION]. In the new commercial mixed-use zones chapter, we are amending, again, the affordable housing bonus that exists now to be consistent with the [ORGANIZATION] approach. So we'll be implementing that with this."
04_20_2016,homeless,"All right. DATE0 I was homeless and I tried to stay at, while working at my job, at [ORGANIZATION]. And [ORGANIZATION] at the time was having fights about energy"
04_20_2016,homeless,"and they were thinking about getting a grant for solar cells. And then I heard you're going to, which I like solar cells and I'd like to promote alternative energy. People who are homeless or live homeless use propane tanks for heat."
04_20_2016,homeless,"I'd still like to double back, and I heard you are going to move Right to Dream 2 to [ORGANIZATION], although it's appealed. If you do, instead of looking down at homeless people like they're in a zoo,  Why don't you try to get these homeless people to use solar cells so they can get online, try to make the camp off the grid? I actually walked by [ORGANIZATION]."
04_20_2016,homeless,"I'd like to move to [ORGANIZATION] and maybe be a lobbyist. If I fail, I've given up my [ORGANIZATION] apartment, so I might have to use the homeless [STREET] that I want to be solar-powered. Certainly not exclusively solar-powered, but just say that they're kind of somewhat off the grid."
04_20_2016,homeless,"Somebody had a noisy generator next to this shack I was in. And also, you wouldn't have to have these noisy generators. And I've seen this site near FAC0, and I think it's an excellent [STREET] to say that we're using science for homeless people."
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"My name is [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] of ORG0. In [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] signed an agreement with five other parties to provide land for up to 300 affordable housing units. Other signatories, ORG2, [PERSON], and [LOCATION] were to work together to make it happen."
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"Why bother replacing housing when the signed agreement released that it needed $5 million from [ORGANIZATION], known as [ORGANIZATION],  so that ORG2 and [PERSON] could finish working together to buy up 22 blocks of property with the force of eminent domain displacing mostly black tenants and clearing the land. [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION], FAC0, and ORG6 insist that ORG7 do the right thing.  begin the process of creating up to 300 affordable housing units, as agreed to by the city and [PERSON], by rezoning three blocks of [PERSON]'s property at the southeast corner of their campus from [ORGANIZATION] to FAC1. It's past the time to heal from the institutional racist violence endured [ORGANIZATION] by hundreds of people."
04_20_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,"And on [ORGANIZATION], we were asked by [ORGANIZATION] to have ORG2 and the City of [ORGANIZATION] develop a local action plan. Also, since – which really, because of the makeup and the direction of the steering committee on the [ORGANIZATION] project, that local action plan, which you'll see in the near future, is focused on economic development and affordable housing development because of the concern, especially in that corridor, for displacement because that's the communities that are there. Secondly, since that – we approved that [ORGANIZATION] concept plan, we've all become virtually aware of the housing crisis."
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"And when you think of the level of funding regionally that we're going to need to raise to build this project, it seems that we would probably expect that we would have a housing component that would be part of that regional look at funding. So as we go into the next phase, which we greatly support with [ORGANIZATION] planning, at least we'll start to try to move forward our thinking on an affordable housing component. You're looking at me."
04_20_2016,affordable housing,so i heard your support for this and to join in leveraging the contributions that have come from [ORGANIZATION] GPE1 GPE2 metro [PERSON] and [PERSON] and with that happy to answer any questions thank you thank you i think we have some questions uh [ORGANIZATION] i appreciate this presentation i'm very excited about the prospects of high capacity transit in the barber corridor as as you know uh i guess i want to just drill down a little bit on  what we're talking about being more intentional about making sure affordable housing is constructed in this new corridor
04_20_2016,affordable housing,so i'm trying that typically when you build lines you you do purchase lots of property and i guess i'm curious how we're going to integrate  properties you acquire with redevelopment potential for affordable housing? And is affordable housing development a strategy that is discussed in the draft environmental impact statement?
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"I agree with that. And an example of our past strategy, which I would contend we need to grow, maybe put on steroids if you will, is that we have  acquired opportunity parcels for construction staging and then have turned those parcels over into opportunities for uh for housing development when we started flight rail construction that was largely to demonstrate transitory into development well candidly we don't need to do that now the the goal of these same sorts of strategies will be affordable housing  And I can give you two examples along the current alignments where we're working to do that right now."
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"There are many more, but one is up at our site at FAC0, just sort of kitty corner from FAC1 in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood. We've been working with [ORGANIZATION], as you know, and ORG1 on a site which is the northwest corner of FAC0 and FAC2,  and we will be integrating affordable housing into a proposal that will be hitting the streets here shortly, a request for a proposal that will be hitting the streets here shortly. And, again, that's a partnership with the city agencies as well as ORG2 writing down property in order to achieve that outcome."
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"redeveloping property it's purchased, including for affordable housing. So affordable housing strategy and relative impacts of options will be looked at in the draft environmental impact statement. Commissioner, if I can just add to that."
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"And I'm going to direct this question to [ORGANIZATION] because I have no doubt that people of goodwill can be opportunistic in looking for options along the route. But I think what this council is likely to say is we want to actually have hard numbers, goals, and we want to make sure all of our tools are put to the service of accomplishing those goals. [ORGANIZATION], in addition to tag-teaming with [PERSON] and being the champions for affordable housing at [ORGANIZATION], you're a former planning director."
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"Right. And so what we'll be looking for is some guidance as to what conditions we can put on our funding component of this project, because obviously the council is very supportive of this project, that ensures that we meet measurable goals on affordable housing, not just good intentions. Any feedback?"
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"And I know that Commissioner [PERSON] is leading that effort to take the –  inclusionary zoning opportunity, and the ability to adopt a construction excise tax to help fund some of those incentives and otherwise provide for affordable housing. In the sessions, actions [ORGANIZATION], the legislature neglected or failed to include [ORGANIZATION] among the governmental levels that can exercise that policy. excise tax."
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"The partnership, let's take the model, though, of urban renewal, where we've had some hits and some misses. We have been at least intentional about setting the aspirational goals. And can we take the same thinking to this project where we look at the length and breadth of the line and we set some goals for the mix of housing, the number of houses that are affordable, and then look to see how through prescriptive measures like perhaps [ORGANIZATION] deciding that no land that it owns will be developed without an inclusionary housing component or something.  or first choice going to affordable housing development the [STREET] you've done on [ORGANIZATION] a couple of occasions to great success or those kinds of things."
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"so it's good to know that uh and having rid uh ridden whatever the bus uh down barber uh obviously there's room for uh work here i also want to thank commissioner PERSON0 for uh asking if the eis is scoped  to include housing and affordable housing. After having the public comment earlier where we learned about some of the failures in our community to do the right thing in partnership with [ORGANIZATION], it would be great if we can, not just on this project but on all projects, try and pressure for state and federal issues that include scoping for affordable housing issues."
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"But I'm more interested in the development and have been over [ORGANIZATION] working with [ORGANIZATION] and all the local jurisdictions in planning for the line because of the concern I have for an equitable community, including affordable housing for folks that live and work in [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and  having participated in a number of probably half a dozen different groups, including [ORGANIZATION] ID Southwest with Commissioner [PERSON] and others, the [ORGANIZATION] Planning Housing Land Use Groups, [PERSON], [PERSON], and [LOCATION]. having co-chaired [ORGANIZATION] during this really exciting period, I want to commend staff at all the jurisdictions who've been so actively involved. We never had a negative response when we asked, which was constantly for folks to come out and give us updates."
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"So it's been, I think, a good amount of stakeholder outreach, and that'll need to continue. So not to repeat what you have already asked of [ORGANIZATION] and what other folks have asked you for,  We just hope that as you go through the environmental impact statement process and really start on this line, that affordable housing, we do set really tangible targets. I don't think 30% to 50% would be out of line, just as it is in [ORGANIZATION] districts."
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"And I hope that we can, in [ORGANIZATION], have some of the jurisdictions follow suit  As usual, you may be taking the lead and pushing some of those new tools into practice, and we really appreciate that. So just to reiterate, a lot of new tools will need to come to bear, and we look forward to working with you in a variety of ways as community stakeholders and as affordable housing developers. [ORGANIZATION] couldn't be here from [ORGANIZATION], but I think she would have echoed the same comments."
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"Thank you. One of the concerns I always have on some of these large transportation projects when we're getting to the billions of dollars is that I want to have more of an emphasis, and I think I do commend Commissioner [PERSON], again, for emphasizing affordable housing, utilizing inclusionary zoning. But one of the things I think we really miss on some of these larger projects is that we have to have an understanding that,  Using an example of [ORGANIZATION] that they have a tremendous amount of employees that are working downtown"
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"And when we provide this type of infrastructure We have to stress to some of these larger corporations that there is a responsibility For you to develop workforce housing. It's one thing to create jobs It's another thing to utilize the current housing market out there for your employees and  But it's another thing to start planning in the future and understanding that if you don't start investing in the affordable housing, we're going to have some very serious problems on being able to provide housing for the overall market."
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"And when these opportunities are presented, now is the time for these larger corporations to step up and understand that these are great opportunities also –  to invest along these type of transportation lines and systems here. And understand that when you're building more workforce housing, affordable housing, that also takes the real stress away from the city of [ORGANIZATION] on trying to provide housing within the overall market. So now is the time to step up and understand that we can't continue to go in the same direction"
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"And we need your assistance to step up and start investing in these type of projects in affordable housing along these systems. Thank you. Thank you, [ORGANIZATION]."
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], would you please call the roll? Substitute? Well, I appreciate the opportunity to revisit [ORGANIZATION], and it's really exciting, as I said, and I hope that we all marshal our forces together, the city and metro and [ORGANIZATION] and the other cities that are participating in this group to really seize this opportunity to integrate affordable housing opportunities at the outset and to make it more intentional."
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"For those who worry that we somehow don't represent the entire city of [ORGANIZATION], I need to note that this is the last one, that I have allocated $36 million to East [ORGANIZATION] ORG0 since I've been [ORGANIZATION], a fraction of that in [ORGANIZATION],  and elsewhere around the city too. So I personally believe that the commission form of government makes us all responsible for a wide range of decisions, and that's a good thing for our community. I also appreciate the concerns that have been raised about affordable housing."
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"And a market failure is whenever – is a time that the city needs to intervene. So when the city provides affordable housing, that's because the market fails to provide housing for a portion of the population that is underserved. Obviously, when –  Cities build streets and sewers through greenfield areas that aids and abets development."
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"Because of the [ORGANIZATION], he was able to build a 90-unit apartment building consisting of affordable housing and market rate units there. And after he built that, some good things happened to the neighborhood. First people in the neighborhood realized that the neighborhood was changing for the better."
04_20_2016,affordable housing,My  My dream is to build 130 affordable housing units and market rate housing of some sort. I have never...  thank you sir you have to wrap it up okay i've never built those uh
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"So I just want to reiterate that many members of [ORGANIZATION] as individuals oppose downzoning this neighborhood. For many reasons, we can look at ORG1 recent affordable housing study and their opposition to downzoning, particularly in  went into a lot of the deliberation when we were Looking at [ORGANIZATION] on the ORG2 is a fact that through the [PERSON] plan and through the comprehensive plan We're looking at equal distribution of benefits and burdens that includes density that includes affordable housing So to down zone a neighborhood that frankly has a higher medium income has a higher percentage of non or of of  non-minorities, non-communities of color than let's say neighborhoods like GPE2. To downzone that really flies in the face of some of these principles that we've set forward."
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"And we want to  be sure that, again, the full city is accountable and is carrying their weight on providing affordable housing that provides opportunities for all Portlanders. We do not want to see a continued path of economic or racial segregation in this city. So we really..."
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"By calling for the addition of middle housing in single-family home neighborhoods, it appears the density extremists and affordable housing crusaders have teamed up to destroy the village in their eyes to save it. This paradigm would be equivalent to constructing 80-story buildings in downtown [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION]. The whole idea of middle housing throws out traditional zoning that has been designed to protect the sanctity of [ORGANIZATION]'s diverse single-family home neighborhoods and tears at the heartstrings of the very neighborhoods that people buy into the  for their livability."
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"The comments I heard from the planning staff in support of the proposed zoning change is that the area has an existing mix of housing types and that there is a potential for affordable housing in the area. I think the residents of the area are being treated unfairly by the [STREET] these justifications are currently proposed to be implemented. the issues of a mix of housing types and a need for affordable housing are equally true for many parts of [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] if the principles upon which this the proposed zoning change are valid they should be discussed and implemented in the neighborhood  or a citywide change of zoning standards, not by picking on a few households."
04_20_2016,housing crisis,"DATE0, our landlord finally found a buyer for the old FAC0 housing where my family has lived for [LOCATION]. We don't know the implications for this, but our housing crisis couldn't be more evident as we perused [ORGANIZATION]'s staggeringly limited rental supply. We oppose amendments S-20 and S-21 in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood that down-designate significant blocks along FAC1 that have potential for higher densities to support more housing types and affordable options for renters such as myself to stay in the neighborhood."
04_20_2016,homeless,"I currently live in a 60-unit trailer park that's under sale that was done very secretively without any notice to the tenants. It houses 60 people, our most vulnerable citizens, children, disabled, and veterans. It puts me at risk with my [ORGANIZATION] father for becoming homeless.  working with [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], the ORG2 organization, [ORGANIZATION]."
04_20_2016,homeless,"I can't be homeless again, and I'm asking for your help. Thank you for your activism and your testimony. And thank you for coming."
04_20_2016,homeless,Right now we just don't want to be homeless. Excuse me for interrupting you. I just need my little tin can.
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"So if the parks are preserved, they provide stability to the rest of the housing in the neighborhood by creating permanent affordable housing. But if they are allowed to be developed, then that is five cells that displace hundreds of families and create a huge ripple effect that will affect everybody in the community. One of the parks in the neighborhood is FAC0, FAC1, and it is currently being sold."
04_20_2016,homeless,"So we're asking [ORGANIZATION] to immediately work with the FAC0 residents to prevent the loss of their homes and preserve the FAC0 as a permanent, affordable [STREET] for low-income people to find stable and secure housing in our city. And I would just add that when you look at the population in the FAC0, you see military veterans, low-income families, disabled people, all the people that are on the margins and on the edge and  highest risk of being homeless in the city. Thank you very much."
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"They are providing housing opportunity for folks who have struggled for [ORGANIZATION] to find stable housing. And they could represent a permanently affordable housing stock in our neighborhoods. The impending closure of FAC0 threatens to displace 30 families, as you've heard."
04_20_2016,homeless,"Other mobile home parks in [ORGANIZATION] and elsewhere in the city are sure to follow, and hundreds of low-income families are.  are at risk of becoming homeless when these parks are sold and closed, which is really a matter of time as land values continue to escalate and the profit that could be made by redeveloping them for other uses makes these properties attractive targets for investors. Commissioner [PERSON], you mentioned the lack of tools in our toolkit. That is a concern."
04_20_2016,homelessness,"Others around the country have done the same. Right now, we are working alongside the [ORGANIZATION] residents with [ORGANIZATION], which is prepared to help the residents make a competing offer to purchase and self-manage the park as a co-op, as you suggested. But we do need help from the city and state and county to fill that funding gap to make that happen and prevent homelessness."
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"There's a great need for smaller, more affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] is not the answer. It is a heavy-handed, one-dimensional solution to a problem which presents a variety of subtleties and opportunities."
05_17_2017,affordable housing,"For example, some community use fees and permits, as well as development early design assistance. For this [ORGANIZATION]'s update, and consistent with [ORGANIZATION]s past, we remain committed to [ORGANIZATION] and affordable housing objectives. To provide better service, there are a couple new fees for temporary [STREET] use and traffic control permitting."
05_17_2017,affordable housing,"As compared to mechanical demolition, deconstruction also creates significantly more jobs, including entry-level jobs that can lead to higher paying jobs. Finally, if the [ORGANIZATION] does not slim down the east side overlay zones identified with the residential infill project and or if [LOCATION] [DATE] passes through the legislature without significant changes whereby the bill addresses affordable housing instead of giving developers card blank by preempting local zoning, there will be a significant escalation of starter, first time buyer and affordable renter homes being torn down. For a city that prides itself by promoting reuse and recycling, it is only common sense to expand the deconstruction program to include homes built [ORGANIZATION]."
05_17_2017,housing insecurity,"We had a call from a woman whose rent was being increased. This is  a very common call that we get. In [ORGANIZATION], about 50% of the 300 calls we get are from older adults experiencing housing insecurity."
05_17_2017,houseless,"I feel that the houseless community is completely discriminated against with the Rose Festival, especially blatantly regarding the rights that Rose Festival has to camp in the streets, to get tents, the stores help them out, everybody gets to crash on the streets, no cops, you know, this whole thing. And it's a blatant  disregard to how houseless people actually live and get swept off the streets while the Rose Festival people enjoying themselves get to hang out on the streets in tents. So that's one issue, but my main issue is [ORGANIZATION], and there will be protests."
05_17_2017,homeless,"I don't know if that's the community village. The staffer mentioned a community village. But right now, while we have homeless people sleeping underneath FAC0 and those access ramps for FAC0, there's no porta potty there."
05_17_2017,houseless,"Okay. And the reason I ask that is because I'm concerned that $400,000 can be put into an allowance for retaining architecture consultants and other subcontractors and subconsultants and all these things. but yet, I mean, that's extraordinarily higher than we've even allocated or approved or come to an agreement on as far as the houseless budget."
05_17_2017,houseless,"And I know that during this project, the houseless community is going to be affected. So I'm wondering how that is going to be, how can you justify this kind of a budget to,  keep these people on retainer when we may not even use them. And yet it's such a struggle to get any money for the houseless or any projects going for the houseless that's sustainable and long-term, making the streets safer for our houseless, investing in tiny homes."
05_17_2017,houseless,Whatever money is not utilized for this...  Let's talk about utilizing that leftover money for the houseless. Let's put that into a plan to utilize for the houseless. It goes into the spectator fund.
05_17_2017,houseless,"Specifically the houseless that are displaced by this particular project, whether it be sweeps or just not even being able to be there because of construction concerns or anything like that. Okay. Thank you."
05_17_2017,homeless,"I have an amendment number two, which would amend Attachment D, specifically the budget note that refers to [ORGANIZATION], and it would read as follows. Title, [PERSON]. ORG2 directs ORG3 to coordinate a work session to discuss the [ORGANIZATION]'s role in supporting the efforts of [LOCATION], which will include a discussion of current and future funding levels, insert, including funding sustainability."
05_17_2017,homeless,"The results have been very good. As Commissioner [PERSON] said at the beginning of the discussion, there were a lot of questions about whether this would be a successful partnership, and the data I've received suggests it's very successful, that it works with some of the most chronically homeless people, connecting them with important services that they need. It connects people with potential behavioral health issues with service providers that  rather than sending them to jail."
05_17_2017,affordable housing,"I've given testimony about the graffiti, uh, abatement, uh, funding and the issues around that. Um, and, uh, some issues around, uh, the additional park rangers, uh, issues that we've had with, uh, crime and safety issues in our neighborhood. Um...  I've given testimony about affordable housing, and there's definitely things there for that."
05_17_2017,houseless,"And he was quite flippant about it. That's not true. We've been coming here [ORGANIZATION] after [ORGANIZATION] after [ORGANIZATION] since [LOCATION], begging and pleading to be brought to the table to get funds allocated to really seriously help and sustain programs for our houseless neighbors."
05_17_2017,homeless,Okay. The homeless problem. Part of the problem is you guys put it in the media that there's a homeless problem because there are people that really care.
05_17_2017,homeless,"And that's the reason that I'm here instead of like [ORGANIZATION] where they asked me to, why don't you come with our homeless rights group and speak to the city? Because I don't know what y'all have done over [ORGANIZATION], but the city is not trying to hear. But here in [PERSON] and the climate and the deal, there are public lands everywhere."
05_17_2017,homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION] significant new funds in [ORGANIZATION], affirming our belief that one death on our streets is too many.  continues our commitment to partnering with the county to fight homelessness in our community, and affirms our plan to streamline the delivery of services to people most in need. And I want to acknowledge the mayor's early work to build a strong partnership with [ORGANIZATION]. That relationship is crucial to our success going forward."
05_17_2017,homeless,"We rely on volunteers in [ORGANIZATION], so we need to continue to support them as we need to.  25 million plus for [ORGANIZATION], that's a lot of money. When people come and say that they were not doing anything, I just keep thinking, well, 25 million is a lot of money, particularly in conjunction with the tripling of ORG2 budget over the time that I've been on the council. Okay."
05_17_2017,homelessness,"I'm sure you have enough time. I believe it's to our credit as a council and a sign that we have clear priorities that this budget was passed with little fanfare and even less controversy. [ORGANIZATION] is poised to make significant investments to improve our roads, address homelessness, and foster economic growth."
05_17_2017,homelessness,"The [ORGANIZATION] approved an initial investment of $50 million in critical infrastructure that will grow to $600 million over [ORGANIZATION]. We approved a $25 million investment in [ORGANIZATION] to provide rent assistance, shelter, and housing placement. We've increased funding to minimize the impacts of homelessness as they relate to public health, safety, and livability."
05_17_2017,homeless; homelessness,"Through the work of [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION], we've been able to invest additional resources to increase the program's capacity to particularly focus on serving more people who are experiencing homelessness or at imminent risk of losing their housing. By [PERSON], we anticipate serving at least 300 additional households who are homeless or at risk of homeless through some very strategic, connected employment, housing, and culturally specific services that have been available through ORG1 and the ORG2. So thank you for investing in this important program."
05_17_2017,homeless,"The eligibility requirement is that they're below 50% of median family income. Almost all of them, though, are below 30% of median family income. There's a programmatic focus on homeless, people at imminent risk of eviction, residents of public housing, ex-offenders, immigrants, and communities of color."
05_17_2017,homelessness,"This includes about $2.5 million DATE0 to increase the number of career coaches and the number of community-based organizations partnering within this program, $1.8 million for occupational training to support entry into high-growth programs,  career track occupations that are aligned with target sectors of [ORGANIZATION] and work systems. 1.1 million in on-the-job trainings, paid internships and other work-based learning opportunities and a little over half a million in rent assistance, being a program that serves very low-income people. People are sometimes impacted by homelessness during the course of services and they're able to complete their training and move into employment more effectively while housed."
05_17_2017,homeless,"The [ORGANIZATION] community-based providers use their knowledge and expertise to serve specific populations with one-on-one individualized career coaching and occupational training in the community. Of course, much of the training is provided through a strong connection to ORG1 resources, which include training scholarships, paid work experiences, and placement support for career track jobs. The populations that we're referring to are homeless and housing insecure residents, 26% of our program in [ORGANIZATION]."
05_17_2017,homeless,"For the 400 formerly chronically homeless folks that were served by [ORGANIZATION], their average is $11.30, which is –  a real accomplishment for that population to connect with work and to get onto the path. For the 60 immigrants in [ORGANIZATION], that average wage was $16.84. So really digging into the details of which populations have which results is part of what this program does."
05_17_2017,homeless,"That extension helps us to focus on homeless and housing insecure populations, and also it added [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] to the existing strong network of providers, which increased the culturally specific approaches to work with those communities of color who were in this program and seeking services and support. So I'd like to...  say the person. Our testimony that we're introducing in writing would have been presented by [ORGANIZATION], who is the director of ORG2 at ORG3."
05_17_2017,homelessness,"For us, we have been a provider with economic opportunity program and work systems for some time. What I am, and on the youth side for the most part, and I think you guys are pretty much aware of our work on the youth side here,  But what I'm really excited about, we have had an opportunity through this process to address homelessness with some of our young adults and some of our families as a result of this work. And it's been huge."
05_17_2017,homelessness,"And we look forward to working with this particular project around homelessness moving forward because there are so many of our students and families that are dealing with this issue. In our program,  We serve about 2,000 participants a year. Forty-eight percent are African American, 27%  6% are [ORGANIZATION], and 23% are low-income white folks that we work with."
05_17_2017,homelessness,"And when I started meeting with [ORGANIZATION] once I paroled, I was housed downtown at the [ORGANIZATION]. And I don't know if you're familiar with that, but that's right in the heart of homelessness. A lot of drug use, a lot of prostitution, a lot of pimps are down there."
05_17_2017,homeless,or I thought I was going to end up homeless. That's really where I was on the verge of that. And I got involved with the program and they provided for me training as a [ORGANIZATION] to start.
05_17_2017,homeless,"And when we took the housing money out of [ORGANIZATION] and created a new [ORGANIZATION],  It was at that time that then-Mayor [PERSON] made the decision to put the programs in [ORGANIZATION] and try to harness the power of the economic development side of the ledger. And I had the same misgivings about doing that that I later had when we proposed taking some of the homeless services out of ORG2 and migrating them to the county. And it wasn't because I was...  reluctant to consider ways of better aligning or streamlining or delivering services."
04_17_2019,houseless,"Is that journalistic bombast or speaking truth to power? If a white mayor tells an unnamed elected official it's disrespectful, if a landlord representative is reduced to tears due to unduly harsh treatment by tenant rights organizers and pro-tenant politicians, is that disrespectful? Are houseless folks camped out in tents and tarps on sidewalks by the hundreds or even thousands, are they being disrespected by landlord real estate moguls, whether these landlord reps are crying or not?  Several [ORGANIZATION] cities have declared [ORGANIZATION]-long housing emergencies."
04_17_2019,homeless,"Because when I was back in [ORGANIZATION] visiting the [ORGANIZATION] for my autoimmune disorder, I  I visited a shelter, a [INSTITUTION] out there. They were in a parking garage in [PERSON]. And somebody, one of the women, had clogged one of the toilets."
04_17_2019,homeless,"and these women, these 200 women don't have access to a bathroom and what do you know, here's [STREET] roots, here's the thing about parks like FAC0 blocking the bathrooms for elderly, disabled, [PERSON] and homeless people. Here we have why we can't go. So, you know, I don't know how many people were at that FAC1 game [TIME], 30,000, 150,000, but they all got on the horn and those bathrooms got open."
04_17_2019,homeless,"So you can take back some of this money  You can use it for low income and homeless and disabled people because let me tell you the number of beds For the mentally ill I can count them on my fingers that they've opened [ORGANIZATION] okay, just like that and that's it"
04_17_2019,homeless,and You know to the detriment of homeless people of which [ORGANIZATION] is the second highest homeless population in the nation per capita You have you  cater to big business. All right. Thank you.
04_17_2019,affordable housing,"and I'm asking [ORGANIZATION] for the approval of the FAC0 [ORGANIZATION] so we can continue our vision of creating a community in the [ORGANIZATION] area. With the approval of this [ORGANIZATION], we will be able to start projects that will help with the connectivity of the streets to keep the community safe. Without the approval of this [ORGANIZATION], the neighborhood will not have a chance to be developed, we will not be able to build high density affordable housing, we will not be able to help small businesses and not be able to employ hundreds of people."
04_17_2019,homeless,"Perfectly timed as well. I would like to see more established arts groups include...  homeless and low-income and disabled people and minorities and LGBTQ people in their art showings and art exhibitions. And integrate, integrate, show great works alongside people who do great art but are in poverty."
04_17_2019,affordable housing,"We have to hear the amendment. The amendment is the council declares an emergency exists because [ORGANIZATION] needs to proceed with their mixed-use and affordable housing project. Therefore, this ordinance shall be in full force in effect from and after its date of passage."
04_17_2019,affordable housing,"Advisory bodies provide guidance on a wide array of city functions, emergency response, utilities, availability of safe, affordable housing, just to name a few. Volunteers have a special role within city government. On advisory bodies they engage on a dedicated level and they advise on our services."
04_17_2019,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] works to further fair housing in our community through [ORGANIZATION] fair housing testing, legal services, renter protection policies, and affirmative fair housing marketing. But barriers to housing and neighborhood choice include a broad spectrum of social attitudes and policies that are not limited to housing alone. These are barriers such as a lack of access to public transportation, a lack of access to living wage jobs, or historic zoning that has caused a lack of affordable housing choices."
04_17_2019,affordable housing,I can't say this often enough. Housing is a basic need and it is a human right. I ran my campaign for this seat on a platform of tenant protections and affordable housing programs.
04_17_2019,housing crisis,"Stabilizing tenants and increasing access to housing is one of the most vital contributions I can make from where I now sit. I've dedicated considerable staffing resources to addressing our housing crisis over [ORGANIZATION], and most recently this work has resulted in our fair access and rental proposal, or [ORGANIZATION].  which was presented to council [LOCATION]. I'm incredibly proud of the work my office has done on behalf of the nearly 50% of Portlanders who are renters."
04_17_2019,affordable housing,"I work for [ORGANIZATION], our ORG1 Director. And I'm here [ORGANIZATION] to talk about or work in [ORGANIZATION], the [PERSON] area, and we're starting to work in LOC2. We've been working with metro cities and affordable housing providers to make sure that there is an equitable first outcomes, fair outcome if or when the [PERSON] line happens."
04_17_2019,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] has been involving ORG1 since [ORGANIZATION] and we started working in partnership with ORG2, [PERSON], [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION], also known as ORG6. And our collective vision is to make sure that when there is new developments, that everyone that is going to be impacted by the projects has a chance to raise their voice and is listened to. We specifically want to lift up the voices of the community members that tend not to participate for the many reasons, as many of you know, people of color, people with disabilities, immigrants, refugees,  renters, transit riders, youth, rural communities, et cetera."
04_17_2019,affordable housing,"So we encourage them to not only write this letter, but to call their elected official and show up to [ORGANIZATION] and ask for renters protections. We now have the most progressive renters protections in the nation. So, I'm here [ORGANIZATION] to ask you to keep supporting fair, affordable housing and protections for all in every aspect."
04_17_2019,housing crisis,"So we're here [ORGANIZATION] to honor the Fair Housing Act, enacted into law [LOCATION]. But it's a bittersweet celebration when we know that, as Senator [PERSON] warned, housing discrimination continues in our nation and here in our city. And it's a sad memorial when [ORGANIZATION] our housing crisis appears so intractable."
04_17_2019,homeless,"Unfortunately, displacement is now occurring. Our [ORGANIZATION] schools are losing students. But most important, when you look at the data, it's those that are on free lunch, or they speak another language at home, or they're in our [ORGANIZATION] program, or they're homeless."
04_17_2019,affordable housing,"But the last step, I've been working a lot on this research, have met with many of the providers of affordable housing. We want something that is reasonable, easy to implement, and doesn't have unintended consequences. So the last step in our research is to meet with our community members who are those renters, those ones we are concerned about that are being displaced, because it's important that their voice is heard, not just from...  the agencies or nonprofits that represent them, but the actual people who are living in those rental units."
04_17_2019,affordable housing,I'm the Director of [ORGANIZATION] at [ORGANIZATION] and I'm honored to serve on [ORGANIZATION]. Community participation does not happen by chance. Most people will voluntarily participate if they can derive a benefit to themselves and their community.
06_01_2016,homeless,[ORGANIZATION] wars on the homeless. They evict... Homeless and mentally ill people.
06_01_2016,homeless,"So that's a conflict of interest, her being involved in [ORGANIZATION] and then being part of a group that bullies and evicts the mentally ill and the homeless. Sorry, that's a real issue. And then where's my video surveillance tape of my arrest on [ORGANIZATION]?"
06_01_2016,affordable housing,"I know because that's where I lived. And there were simply too many taxpayer-funded monologues by the likes of [ORGANIZATION] about affordable housing and it put of the locals, churches full of the elderly and black residents who in fact...  did not want these demolitions and these shoddy new constructions that cost $3,000 a month. Meanwhile, a group of people who should be honored a hundredfold more than PERSON1, remember I held that book up to you [ORGANIZATION], scraped together enough for us to save us from collective amnesia about [ORGANIZATION]."
06_01_2016,homeless,"I understand that [ORGANIZATION] felt that it was a good choice to go under FAC0 and fence it off and lease that land from ORG1 in a  in order to punish mentally ill people and homeless people that had been sleeping there. So that's a great job. And then, you know, I was labeled a white supremacist by one of her fellow co-op members, [ORGANIZATION], who is a transgender person, and he actually serves on the board of directors at ORG2."
06_01_2016,homelessness,"From the homelessness angle... We see a lot, incrementally, more and more transgender people in the community. And that is a reflection, of course, of what's going wrong."
06_01_2016,homeless,"Homeless people don't. But maybe we can push this number, increase it, and...  I like to say, oh, yeah, and then, boy, I'm just going everywhere, but this is fun. So [ORGANIZATION], people share bathrooms, women and men."
06_01_2016,homeless,"And it's equally illegal and difficult to you. If these windows were open, we could see the two blocks that separate the men's bathroom from the women's bathroom, all of which will be available to whomever soon. Except after [TIME], when if you're homeless or not, you're locked out of the bathroom."
06_01_2016,homeless,"I know there's some hope that we can have everybody [ORGANIZATION] next to or not immediately next to but near and with indoor plumbing sometime within [ORGANIZATION], but When we're talking about bathrooms, we need to face the reality that we're still doling out potties as a privilege and  If you have a life where you can go home to a bathroom, we can lock up the public bathrooms at [TIME]. The loo, of course, there are the three loos to service 3,000 homeless people. And so in addition to the political correctness, and as [ORGANIZATION] mentioned, I know that the mayor mentioned whichever state passed its ridiculous discrimination law so we couldn't go visit the USS Portland when it was in [ORGANIZATION], right?"
06_01_2016,affordable housing,"20% of the respondents used the words vote, help, advocate, or volunteer in their answer. But more than anything else, what we heard was that people were concerned about affordable housing. 127 responses had the word affordable in the language."
06_01_2016,homeless; homelessness,"19% of overall responses then, and that accounts for more than 40% of the housing responses. Another word that figured heavily was homeless or homelessness, which consisted of 7% of responses and 19% of housing. So what we did was we tried to identify patterns within each of the issues."
06_01_2016,affordable housing,"For housing, folks would suggest things like zoning to encourage development that supported affordable housing or vouchers to subsidize low-income households. But often there was anger and disappointment in these particular issue answers. Some people even just left question marks as their pledge."
06_01_2016,affordable housing,"So we didn't actually do a lot of exit interviews. And what outcomes do you expect and what will you be doing with all this input? Well, so we have all the data collected, and we did have some interaction with several bureaus, [ORGANIZATION], and a couple of the folks who are doing affordable housing stuff in [ORGANIZATION] stopped by, and we are happy to share data with anyone who wants it."
06_01_2016,homelessness,"But I think we have to – our primary focus morally and otherwise is on [STREET] homelessness and people in crisis. We all understand that, and that's why the mayor has proposed a record budget in terms of investment. Okay."
06_01_2016,homeless,revised excuse me revised solid waste and recycling rates and fees for franchise residential collection and commercial permit tonnage fees effective [ORGANIZATION]. roll call please hi remind everybody that we are decreasing garbage rates i [ORGANIZATION] and that with a very modest increase in the commercial tipping fee we're going to be putting trash cans in business districts all over the city hi uh five  I'm 91 a man contract with [ORGANIZATION] to increase the not to exceed amount by five hundred seventy two thousand one hundred thirty seven dollars and extend the expiration date until [LOCATION] to provide additional treatment readiness services transitional housing and follow up retention support services to chemically dependent homeless adult chronic arrestees. and [ORGANIZATION] and ms [ORGANIZATION] are here to tell us about this program if you ever get the chance to do what i got to do [ORGANIZATION] and watch a graduation of ORG2 which i think you probably have um
06_01_2016,homeless,"I Was homeless [ORGANIZATION] and I found out these services are necessary and need to be funded and  We're a comfortable [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] dependence to me is also cigarettes. When homeless people come up to me, I was homeless, and ask me for money, I don't give them any money because maybe they're going to go out and buy cigarettes."
06_01_2016,homeless,"I also like to say sometimes, just like sometimes people think the commissioners here and the mayor are heartless, I'm heartless with homeless people. I don't know what their agenda is if I give them money. You know, they go out and buy a fifth and just lay on the sidewalk."
04_04_2018,homeless,"And, sir, could you state your name for the record, please? My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I just wanted to say happy [ORGANIZATION] and may the prayers of the homeless clog your toilets. Thank you."
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"Next, communications, please. Item 309, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding [ORGANIZATION] $500 million affordable housing bond. [TIME]."
04_04_2018,homeless,"Yes, my name is [ORGANIZATION]. I represent [ORGANIZATION] Superjustice Watchdog. I, [ORGANIZATION], would like to declare a state of emergency for homeless children and students in the state of [ORGANIZATION]."
04_04_2018,homeless,"As of [ORGANIZATION], we had approximately 22,541 homeless students. Again, understand that number does not include their parents, which would be families. And again, understand that number does not, this only includes people currently enrolled in the school system for them to be able to do the data."
04_04_2018,homeless,"I think the information from [ORGANIZATION] will substantiate that and the need for it. And when you just look at how many homeless children in use, just alone in [ORGANIZATION] is approximately 7,800. And also understanding when you look and break down the schools themselves, such as [ORGANIZATION], 1,522 homeless students in [ORGANIZATION]."
04_04_2018,homeless,"This is not including the people that are currently out in their cars and possibly tents and possibly not being able to get that data. We are in a crisis for the homeless children and students. I, [ORGANIZATION], am taking it upon myself where the Governor [PERSON] has failed on this issue."
04_04_2018,homeless,"And I, [ORGANIZATION], am declaring a state of emergency for homeless children and students at this time. And I'm asking Governor [PERSON] to address this immediately, provide the proper data, and understand the $1 billion [ORGANIZATION] bond is a beginning... Part of the solution, moving forward on this in an aggressive manner, to have real solutions, not shelters, not motels, not doubling up, but real solutions of permanent housing for the homeless children."
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"313, accept a grant in the amount of $112,500 from [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION] and authorize an intergovernmental agreement. And 314, accept a grant in the amount of $125,000 from [ORGANIZATION] for expanding opportunities for affordable housing in faith communities and authorize an intergovernmental agreement. Colleagues, we're here [ORGANIZATION] to approve two intergovernmental agreements and accept two grants from [ORGANIZATION]."
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"The first item, number 313, it's a grant for $112,500 for [ORGANIZATION]. The second item, number 314, is a grant of $125,000 for expanding opportunities for affordable housing in faith communities. The first, Metro Construction Excise Tax, otherwise known as the [ORGANIZATION] grant, will help to fund a project to develop a concept plan for development for the 20-plus acre site, which is in [ORGANIZATION]."
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"The second, [ORGANIZATION] grant will help fund partnerships with face-based communities to develop affordable housing. ORG1 staff, [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], and [ORGANIZATION], could you come on up and let's...  go through these items. And if you could start us off, please, with an overview, that'd be greatly appreciated."
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"The grants provide funding for projects that might otherwise not be undertaken based on availability of local resources. And so we appreciate the opportunity to use the petro resources. [ORGANIZATION] will talk a little bit about [ORGANIZATION], and [PERSON] will talk a little bit about [ORGANIZATION]."
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"I'm the [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]east [PERSON] with [ORGANIZATION]. And I'll be managing the $125,000 grant called [ORGANIZATION]. This grant will provide an opportunity for the city to partner with several organizations representing the faith community of [ORGANIZATION], as well as with several community development organizations."
04_04_2018,affordable housing,Grant money will be used to develop concept plans and financial feasibility analyses for three sites that will be selected. Engagement with leaders of faith communities will provide practical steps for other congregations to pursue housing projects consistent with their missions. The desired outcome of this grant is to create plans for developing affordable housing on land owned by religious institutions.
04_04_2018,housing crisis; affordable housing,This will serve as a model for other such institutions to follow in the future to address the affordable housing crisis. Any questions? Are there specific – you said there are three specific sites that will be looked at?
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"I represent [PERSON]. I'm having some trouble breathing, so I would ask for your patience. In this presentation...  I heard the word affordable housing used, and I want you, the people that are watching this, to understand something."
04_04_2018,affordable housing,Affordable housing terminology is from [ORGANIZATION]. It means nothing. Nothing.
04_04_2018,homeless,"It has no correlation, no relationship to our homeless problem, our houses problem, or people that are suffering being let go. Nothing. Nothing."
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"So I want the people to understand that when they hear the terminology...  Affordable housing, it's a con job. It's a political con job. And you got them all convinced."
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"Even [ORGANIZATION], your director of [ORGANIZATION] or the director of the...  agency or department or whatever he's called [ORGANIZATION] says that there's 16,000 people living by their fingertips and they keep dropping off. That's your affordable housing. You have to have money to get into affordable housing."
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"I am affordable housing. I'm retired, so I could qualify for affordable housing, but I have to have some money. People on the [STREET] have no money."
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"I think it's important to get that data in front of us to understand what can be done with certain properties. I understand on the [ORGANIZATION] development, they're looking at a tremendous amount of affordable housing at this time. So I do think it's necessary to start looking at the properties and understanding what can and can't be done with them toward affordable housing."
04_04_2018,affordable housing,There we go. My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I'd like to address the term affordable housing.
04_04_2018,homeless; affordable housing,"The term low income, working poor might better reflect what we mean when we talk about affordable housing. And I think... We have to think about the fact that in addressing our homeless crisis, we also have to address the future, not just what's happening [ORGANIZATION]."
04_04_2018,affordable housing,So I think we have to be really careful when we talk about what we're addressing and not just dismiss affordable housing as not helping the people that are on the [STREET] right now. We have to also be thinking about the people that...  could end up on the [STREET] DATE0 or [LOCATION] because we don't have any safety net to catch those people and help those people. And so I just want to say anything I see with affordable housing does not make me angry.
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"Right. And when I use the term affordable housing, I'm talking about people who have either no assets and resources or up to about 60%. But, again, I think it is important that we ask the question affordable to whom."
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"It's uniquely what our role is, and that's what I think we generally mean when we talk about affordable housing.  Exactly. Thank you for that. I appreciate it."
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"And then he never gets to hear the thoughtful conversation again.  that he actually helped create. And that's just too bad. I use the words affordable housing to mean any number of things, but they all mean one thing in common, and that is below market rate."
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"And during my campaign, I knew that people were confused by the term affordable housing, so I started saying workforce and low-income and very low-income housing. And then hilariously, the conversation came back to, well, what do you mean? Which takes us right back to the [ORGANIZATION] definition of affordability, 80% [ORGANIZATION], 60% [ORGANIZATION], 0 to 30% [ORGANIZATION]."
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"What we mean when we are talking about affordable housing for these particular ordinances is to do a study and look at the range of options all the [STREET] from zero up to 80% [ORGANIZATION]. and when proposals finally come before this board, we will be talking about very specific levels of affordability and for whom. And if people stick around for [TIME], we're going to hear from [ORGANIZATION], and we're going to be very specific."
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"about affordability and homeownership and the challenges that are there, particularly for our black community, but that are generally applicable to the entire community. So I don't want us to get too bogged down on what we mean when we're talking about affordable housing, except to say at various levels of affordability for various people at this point. This is a study."
04_04_2018,housing crisis,"After finishing the book, I came away with outrage towards our past leaders, not just in [ORGANIZATION] but throughout the country, that caused and continue to perpetuate the most heinous of housing inequities. The [ORGANIZATION] housing crisis has a number of serious issues, but in my mind, there is one tragedy that stands above them all, housing for people of color. There are several things that I became aware of from reading this book."
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"In [ORGANIZATION], cities across the nation increased minimum lot sizes to make affordable housing impossible. Also sounds very familiar. On page 238 of this book, the following quote, What's important is that until we arouse in Americans the understanding of how we created a system of unconstitutional, state-sponsored, de jure segregation and a sense of outrage about it, neither remedies nor reparations will be on the public agenda."
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"The color of law also debunks the theory that all housing is good housing. Oversupplying cities with market rate and luxury apartments continues to create even more segregated communities. In [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] Commissioner [PERSON] dedicated an additional $20 million to affordable housing to begin to address the ongoing threat of displacement and gentrification."
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"So this is really ripe for some good affordable housing, plus other things that are desired by the community of [ORGANIZATION]. So I'm very happy to accept this grant. Aye."
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"I'd like to thank [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], and I'm pleased to see the chair here [TIME] speaking in support of these proposals and all the other folks in the community who have worked hard to bring this to this stage [ORGANIZATION]. I'd also like to thank ORG2, [PERSON], [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and others for their support of the, and I'm going to use the term, affordable housing program. in faith communities grant because that is the name of the grant."
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"I know, me too. Well, similarly to [ORGANIZATION], it's –  heartening to see landowners, whether they're communities of faith or private landowners, being so intentional about how their property can be used to kind of its fullest potential, including serving existing communities and providing affordable housing. So this is really, really exciting."
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"In our rental projects, we again want to make sure we're communicating timelines and opportunities so that folks are understanding when they will be able to access these possible opportunities. But we also have concerns about changes to some projects that seem to be in the pipeline, for example, around reducing bedroom size to zero and one bedrooms. We are building affordable housing for the very long term here."
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"It's not a good idea  infrastructure for health and resilience. I don't believe in a community. So I think just to be very clear in our conversations about this larger affordable housing topic, which we've been talking about [TIME], that this work in a gentrified neighborhood is vital."
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"And it is highly misleading to the public because people and even the press, to some degree, interpret this as a commentary on our views around affordable housing. And the reality is that has nothing to do with this conversation. This is an appeal from a design review hearing, and we are acting as the appeal board for a design review process."
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"In other words, we would apply the same bonus system that currently exists everywhere else downtown other than the historic district. And the bonus would operate with our existing rules, which in this case would say –  that you get the extra height if you deliver desperately needed affordable housing. So I offer that amendment."
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"And so that proposal...  as you said, is consistent with the [STREET] we've increased height through the FAC0 project. When we've increased height across the central city, it's been through our bonus height system, and that is in an effort to ensure there's a public benefit associated with that increased height. So your amendment is increasing from 125 to 160 on the western side of the block using the bonus height system  as well as the bonus that they would be required to use would be the affordable housing bonus."
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"So there's an extra level, we have a very small number of bonuses. There's the affordable housing bonus, but there's also the option of transferring FAR from a historic resource. In this particular case, this would ensure that they would be using the affordable housing bonus to obtain that bonus height."
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"And they would not be able to use the historic resource bonus? The [STREET] that this has been proposed, no. They would be required to go to the affordable housing bonus first."
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"Well, if they needed more FAR, that would just be a secondary bonus or transfer that they could go to. For this particular case, to obtain that bonus height up to the 160, the proposal just says you need to go to the affordable housing bonus first. And they could go to the historic resource transfer after that?"
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"That's actually a very helpful context for me. Sorry to be absorbing this on the fly, but it's important nuance for me to understand. So fundamentally –  From that perspective, given the important role of [ORGANIZATION], the work we're doing here, 160 versus 200, with different FAR and affordable housing requirements, which are effectively parallel, I don't see how it impacts the historic district one [STREET] or the other."
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"So we have the two choices before us. My amendment ensures that...  that this additional height and the benefit we're giving an owner is treated just as we would treat any other development within the downtown outside of a historic district. It would be subject to a bonus system, and we would have the benefit of some affordable housing."
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"I just want to make sure I'm clear, because Commissioner [PERSON], excuse me, [PERSON], I have increased height to 160 through the bonus height and then require the owner to use affordable housing. Okay, so for purposes of keeping this clean, I would offer my amendment as simply requiring that any height above 125 feet be subject to the housing bonus. Okay."
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"Before we vote. Thank you, Mayor. So to me, what sways me and justifies in my mind the additional height increase from 125 to 200 is the substantial additional yield of affordable housing units."
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"But the delta, the number of increased affordable housing units from, I think, 160 to 200 is about 40 additional units. And then the total number of apartments, I believe, under the 200 feet is 342 apartments total.  versus 199. And that was all public testimony that was given [ORGANIZATION] by, I believe, an architect working with the developer."
04_04_2018,housing crisis; affordable housing,"And I found those numbers to be substantial. And I think, you know, in a time of a housing crisis, we need to be doing all we can to accommodate more affordable housing, and I think this is one [STREET] to do that. But I was also, I have to say quite honestly, I was struck when I – it was [ORGANIZATION] I was driving with my partner to go to dinner –  someplace actually on the east side of the river, but we were going down FAC0 and LOC0."
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"And I think that's the reality we have to square ourselves with here, is this old town, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] has become a ghost town, and we've got to do something to catalyze development here. I think this project does that. and it produces more affordable housing to boot at 200 feet."
03_16_2016,homeless,"We dare not let that neighborhood be degraded while other communities don't have streets and sidewalks in our town. Thank you. Recently, we had the pleasure of having 40% of y'all, well, actually half of the people who are sitting in front of me, came over to the county commission building at the invitation of [ORGANIZATION], part of their hopefully successful strategy to keep their pool, despite the belief that we need a 5% across-the-board reduction so that we can improve the lives of some of our homeless citizens."
03_16_2016,homeless,"And we know we've helped so many homeless veterans, and I know that's on your agenda to try and help find homes, and we're trying to give tools to  to veterans. So any help we could get to partner with us, that would be great. We partner with  [ORGANIZATION] and several employment organizations in the state of [ORGANIZATION]."
03_16_2016,homelessness,"Typically, as you well know, we handle budget allocation requests either through the budget process, through our fall and [ORGANIZATION] bump. And  In congruence with the state of emergency, we're here [LOCATION] to go outside of that norm because there is a need on the [STREET] currently that is not being met that's causing considerable backlog and actually resulting in more people in danger of falling into homelessness at a time when we're trying to get them out of homelessness. So the package that we're bringing here [LOCATION] is a request for unallocated general fund  outside of the budget process to both pay back costs that have been  by [ORGANIZATION] as we've been moving forward on shelter and other programs, and then a request for additional funding, all of which will be spent in [DATE]."
03_16_2016,homelessness,"Obviously, in the budget process, we'll be making decisions to bring forward to the mayor and council on funding for [ORGANIZATION]. This is all for [LOCATION]. remainder of [ORGANIZATION] to keep us moving as we're attacking the issues surrounding homelessness."
03_16_2016,homeless,"The next portion is the property broker, as again, we're working with the mayor's office in identifying and housing and identifying properties for shelters. We had our broker service, which we used to find and identify properties that we enlisted first on this project.  and determine that just the sheer number of properties that come in, not from everybody who's involved in this process as well as the community. We needed to have a staff person who could actually be on the ground going out investigating properties and seeing whether or not these properties have a possible purpose for a shelter or for some other long-term purposes in the housing and homeless issues."
03_16_2016,homeless,"And then finally on our list is the [ORGANIZATION] storage pilot. So the [ORGANIZATION] storage, as you probably heard, opened up [ORGANIZATION] at the [ORGANIZATION] campsite as well as the FAC0 location over on the west side of the FAC0. The camp [ORGANIZATION] storage, again, is...  something that we're piloting to see and address the needs of the homeless."
03_16_2016,homeless,"Currently, homeless people on the [STREET] have nowhere to store their belongings so that they can seek services throughout [ORGANIZATION] or employment or whatever else it might be. The day storage is being piloted at two locations. One is a non-organized camp."
03_16_2016,homelessness,"All of those folks are looking for permanent housing. At the same time, the continued rental crisis and escalating rents and stagnating incomes are pushing thousands of additional individuals and families to the edge of homelessness [ORGANIZATION]. Our providers are reporting receiving hundreds of calls for eviction prevention help [PERSON] that they have to turn away."
03_16_2016,homeless,"So short-term rent assistance, it's very flexible funding that allows a nonprofit agency that is working with someone who is currently homeless to pay first and [ORGANIZATION] rent, application fees, past debt, things that are financial barriers to that family getting into housing. It also allows providers to work with families that have currently a housing situation that they could stay in, but for whatever reason they haven't been able to pay the rent. And it allows us to provide rental assistance maybe for [LOCATION], maybe two, maybe DATE2."
03_16_2016,homeless,"That's right. Who didn't become homeless because we gave them a little bit of help. Exactly, exactly."
03_16_2016,homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION], I'm remembering over [ORGANIZATION] the conversation we've had about short-term rental assistance, which we call straw, and that at almost every time this conversation has come up and we've asked [ORGANIZATION] or our partners if we had one extra dollar to spend, where would we spend it? I think the consensus has been it's our most flexible and our most effective dollar. Because it gets people off the [STREET] quickly, gets them into existing shelter, and in some instances prevents people from falling into homelessness."
03_16_2016,homeless,"And I think the scenario that drives us all crazy is the person that's $100 short on making a rent payment that leads to an eviction, that leads to a parade of horribles with that family that's all preventable if we can keep them in their home. That's right. I've got sort of a side question, which is, do we know what percentage of the homeless population are people who had a home and the rent went up and they couldn't afford the rent increase?"
03_16_2016,homelessness,"I don't off the top of my head. I think we've surveyed in the past sort of primary cause of someone's homelessness. I mean, ultimately, everyone who's out there had a home at some point and for whatever reason is no longer there."
03_16_2016,homelessness,"How many of those?  that the most proximate cause was the rent increase. I don't know the answer to that. What we're hearing from the family system is that about a third of the families that are in the new family shelter have not experienced homelessness before, and that is principally being driven by market conditions in the rental market."
03_16_2016,homelessness,"I mean, I think that would be really useful to have because if rents continue to go up and if that's a major cause of homelessness, then we are going to be dealing with a rising level of homelessness unless we can come up with a hell of a lot of money for rent assistance. Yes. And the challenge of affording the rent was the primary cause was a disability or some other one that –  continued rise in rent levels is definitely preventing folks from ending their homelessness and is a driver."
03_16_2016,homeless,I'm PERSON0. I'm [PERSON] Manager for [ORGANIZATION]. and i want to talk about three additional programs for which we're seeking startup funds um with this um with what we're bringing you [TIME] uh one is a tenant protection team
03_16_2016,homelessness,"Secondly, transportation for people experiencing homelessness who are stranded here and maybe they came here for a job possibility or for family or friends that were here, but they  They need assistance in getting back to where they have a support system, where there's a [STREET] where they might be able to stay permanently. [ORGANIZATION] has had a similar program since [ORGANIZATION] called [ORGANIZATION], where they pay transportation assistance so that people can get back to where they have a support network, so they're not stranded in that city. So it's something that we're looking to start up."
03_16_2016,homelessness,"Because I very strongly believe that the governing structure for all of our work in addressing homelessness needs to be the home for everyone. And specifically, [ORGANIZATION] needs to be the lead agency. And while I have enormous respect for you, [ORGANIZATION], and for [PERSON] and your efforts, what I want to avoid going forward is what to some may be viewed as a series of workarounds."
03_16_2016,homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION]'s shop, whether she's located on this side of the river or the other side of the river, is the top ending homelessness resource in the state of [ORGANIZATION]. I can say that without fear of contradiction. And I just want to make sure that we're aligned and we're not just sort of adding new players and new bureaus and new folks, well-intentioned, but outside of the leadership structure that we've worked so hard to create."
03_16_2016,homeless; homelessness,"I'm delighted you're going to do that. And the lead agency is code language for whether we – a proposal to essentially co-locate the ending homeless team  on the other side of the river, and to marry it with the county's parallel effort to end homelessness and to sort of continue the work that we started with [ORGANIZATION] of looking for better alignment. And that's a work in progress."
03_16_2016,homeless,"And again, we take no money from you guys. I'm sad that there's not representatives from the homeless here [ORGANIZATION]. I'm not sure they understood the significance of what's going on here."
03_16_2016,homeless,"And I'm very uncomfortable speaking for the homeless, because I'm not homeless, so I don't feel it. I don't know what it is, [TIME], to be really freezing. I've never had that experience."
03_16_2016,homeless,"I've always been able to go into a warm [STREET] like you, take a hot shower, have some coffee. It's not that you're spending not enough money,  I would suggest you're not spending the money correctly. And we ask you over and over again that you have homeless representatives on your committees because they're the ones that know."
03_16_2016,homeless,This is a tough question. And I would suggest to you that you might want to consider taking the whole homeless question and separate it from housing. Separate it from the shelters.
03_16_2016,homeless,"So try something new. Take the homeless, whatever the numbers are. I can't believe the numbers people throw around."
03_16_2016,homeless,"And we have still some cracks that I believe that need to be patched in the very hard and productive work that [ORGANIZATION] and his team are doing. If we really believed we had a homeless state of emergency, we would be  if not compelling, effectively partnering with Judge [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION]. And there would be a list telling us exactly how many people are evicted [ORGANIZATION] and making sure those people get connections with essential services."
03_16_2016,homeless,"But, you know, in addition to the actual service work, it is legitimate to budget for agitation and coordination until we can build a more responsive thing. One thing I hope there will be time to look at is  What does the city of [ORGANIZATION] do? It has [ORGANIZATION]."
03_16_2016,homeless; homelessness,"Commissioner [PERSON] isn't here at all [ORGANIZATION], but Commissioner [PERSON], I was, feels like maybe when you didn't vote for the R2D2 and some of the comments you make, it makes me think that looking back when you were housing commissioner and I came here at first as a homeless person [PERSON], how nothing ever got done. And it was such a disappointment after all the work that [ORGANIZATION] had done,  PERSON3 before him, but [ORGANIZATION] and all the plans we had for the [ORGANIZATION] end of homelessness."
03_16_2016,homeless,"When I was homeless more recently, somebody introduced me to the dumpster outside the nines and we were wearing the $9 million slippers that people just throw away when they leave this fancy hotel that gutted out [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]. They got a waiver on their loan. But the people who are now suffering under this emergency, as soon as you announce there was going to be a moratorium on increases, just like when under PERSON2, under the [ORGANIZATION] economic collapse, when there was an announcement that they were going to get tight on credit cards, suddenly people's credit cards went up."
03_16_2016,homeless,"I do appreciate that if we didn't spend this money right now, it could indeed fall to ending fund balance, and that would be an additional $1.4 million for capital maintenance projects, which, as Commissioner [PERSON] pointed out [ORGANIZATION], we do need to be continuing to invest in safety on our streets, with 37 people having died DATE1 on our streets in violent traffic accidents. And there are people dying on our streets from being lack of shelter. We have a homeless and housing affordability emergency."
03_16_2016,homeless,"It is a tragedy that people are outside. And I really appreciate the team's work on this. As Ms. [PERSON] just noted so cogently,  Giving people rent assistance in particular, stopping people from becoming homeless, is by far the most cost effective, and there's a good chunk of change in this ordinance for that and for other necessary things."
03_16_2016,homelessness,"First, I want to just acknowledge we haven't had [ORGANIZATION] in our chambers in a while. I know she's been out for a while, but [ORGANIZATION] Erickson and her team that work on –  long-term, cost-effective solutions to ending homelessness have been leading the [STREET] for a long time. And [ORGANIZATION], thanks to you and your team."
03_16_2016,homelessness,"And for those who somehow think that [ORGANIZATION] is this isolated sort of [STREET] over here that has a unique situation with homelessness, I invite you to go to [PERSON] where they're under a [STREET] order to provide emergency shelter for 60,000 people a night. I invite you to go to GPE2 where a federal judge recently declared there were 50,000 unsheltered people and growing. I invite you to watch the debates for the President of GPE3, and two things you'll notice."
03_16_2016,homeless,"i very much appreciate what commissioner [ORGANIZATION] just said also appreciate what commissioner [PERSON] said about her usual reluctance to engage in budget decisions outside the budget process which i share but i also share her reasons for going along with making a budget decision outside the normal budget process in this case  I just wanted to briefly touch on one element of this proposal, which is funding for [DATE] storage facilities. I think that's important not just for people who are homeless but for the larger community because I think when we get calls from people who are upset about seeing homeless people on the streets and sidewalks, I think to a great extent what they're upset about is seeing a bunch of stuff lying around."
03_16_2016,homelessness,"We are learning from other cities. We had the mayors of the [ORGANIZATION] cities here in [ORGANIZATION], and we spent [LOCATION], along with the Secretary of [ORGANIZATION] and the head of [ORGANIZATION], talking about what works and what doesn't work and how many more people we're each dealing with, as you mentioned, Commissioner [PERSON]. So we're learning from each other."
03_16_2016,homeless,"In fact...  following that meeting, because of a discussion at that meeting, Commissioner [PERSON] and [PERSON] and the folks here before us got on an airplane, went down to [ORGANIZATION] and spent DATE0 looking at FAC0 there, which is, I believe, a better mousetrap and something that we should replicate here, similar to but different from FAC1. Thank you. So we – the second item is deliberate experimentation."
05_20_2015,homeless,about that i can i met on a wrestling mat in [ORGANIZATION] at [ORGANIZATION] so who want to go to i'm withdraw what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what  [PERSON] and think what the kids [PERSON] or the young adults [PERSON] could produce that's what that's what we're trying to achieve here thank you thank you very much thank you we'll follow up with you thank you so much okay um item 490 491 please 491 request of [ORGANIZATION] to address [PERSON] regarding homeless rest area in [ORGANIZATION] good [TIME] commissioners good [TIME]  I probably can't add on to that quote about nothing stops a bullet better than a job. But I'm going to tell you what.
05_20_2015,homeless,"I have been working with the homeless population in the southeast for [ORGANIZATION]. I've been training at [ORGANIZATION], too, which I'm so grateful for, because I'm going to tell you what. I know my people."
05_20_2015,homeless,"I may be a little bit teary now because we lost another one [ORGANIZATION]. Um, people are going to look at him and say he was just a homeless drug addict. Well, I'm going to tell you something about [ORGANIZATION]."
05_20_2015,homeless,"Being diabetic, the homeless lifestyle, you eat bread, you eat white bread. You just, your body can't take it. For people to learn how to thrive, to get out of survival mode and get into prosperity mode, they need to have a hand up, not a handout."
05_20_2015,homeless,"My backyard is designed to partner with many, many people, many agencies, to get them into a [STREET] of safety where they won't be beaten, where they won't – there's no drugs or alcohol allowed in. We have [TIME] security just like at [ORGANIZATION], too. And these folks can come in and they are required to work on whatever it was that made them homeless in the first [STREET]."
05_20_2015,homeless,"They've estimated $14,000 per homeless person. And if you get them the help that they need, traditional housing into housing, it will be half that cost. And that's just temporary cost."
05_20_2015,homelessness,"Just to show that, again, another part of the [ORGANIZATION] story, [PERSON]'s older sister plays soccer at [ORGANIZATION], but we know her because she came and knocked on our door at [ORGANIZATION] and at ORG2 because she was interested in launching a program to combat homelessness in our community. And so just another example of someone who's a graduate of [ORGANIZATION] making a difference in our community. So congratulations to you."
05_20_2015,homeless,"Uh...  But I must say this, I'm homeless, and I'm the happiest homeless man in the world because I've just completed a [ORGANIZATION] campaign entitled [ORGANIZATION], which is an acronym for [ORGANIZATION] PERSON0. Now, usually I have on a certain shirt, which I don't have on [LOCATION] because it's –  Not with me. And I want to show this picture."
05_20_2015,homeless,I don't know if it will show on the screen. And let's just say we made a little quick readjustment there at the FAC0 in [ORGANIZATION]. That's me with a homeless shirt on.
05_20_2015,homelessness,But this is where the ship docks. We're ready to launch a $100 billion marketing campaign literally in homelessness. this is the 44th city I have to go to this is the final city I'm working diligently with everyone that is connected directly indirectly with the homes including yourself but with my allotted time here is it possible I can get a commitment from you as mayor of this beautiful city to stand with us on [ORGANIZATION] to make a brief announcement to the nation that  [ORGANIZATION] is the first city to embrace the worldwide civil rights movement.
05_20_2015,homelessness,"We have [TIME]. Well, certainly this council is working on homelessness, so we're very interested in what you're trying to do. Well, are you willing to work with me to launch a $100 billion marketing campaign on [ORGANIZATION]?"
05_20_2015,homelessness,"Let me just say this. I will be a candidate for the presidency of [ORGANIZATION] to address the needs of the poor and the struggling middle class, because the poor and the middle class does not have a voice in the Republican or the Democratic parties. And I just want to make it clear that this is the city I will announce my candidacy from on [ORGANIZATION], and I need your support, and the whole nation will be watching [PERSON] to see if she's going to do what she's supposed to do insofar as launching this $100 billion campaign that will literally end homelessness and get people off the streets with up to $3,000 of revenue earmarked for that purpose."
05_20_2015,homeless; homelessness,"And what I noticed in [ORGANIZATION] is that, although some people will say New Yorkers are brusque, the city cares about people. They have [ORGANIZATION] where anybody can go and get shelter if they don't have a complicating legal issue or mental health issue [TIME] of their homelessness. And they have could you go to this subject PERSON0?"
05_20_2015,affordable housing,"That's all I really have to offer. And her experience with affordable housing projects is going to be useful. Yeah, and since you prompted it, I think one of the favorite quotes I had in our appointment for her was to wrestle good design out of modest budgets."
05_20_2015,affordable housing,"All right. Roll call. Mayor, I've known [ORGANIZATION] for a long time, and I've seen some of her greatest work that she did with [ORGANIZATION], where in affordable housing development and design, she brought a...  a set of values to the table, a conviction that low-income people should be able to live in a space that's functional and beautiful, an attention to detail and to the bottom line, and ultimately to bringing very complex projects to fruition."
04_05_2017,affordable housing,"So again, I want to have an understanding on that other committee that you want to set up. MY UNDERSTANDING, YOU SAID 25 [ORGANIZATION]. I'D LIKE TO SEE THEIR [ORGANIZATION] AND I'D LIKE TO SEE ALL THE BIOS ON ALL THOSE PEOPLE TO HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING WHO YOU PLAN ON HAVING OVERLOOK ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES IN THIS CITY, A 250 MILLION PLUS DOLLAR BOND TOWARD AFFORDABLE HOUSING, WHICH [ORGANIZATION], THE CITY WILL OWN THIS INVENTORY."
04_05_2017,affordable housing,"Thank you, [PERSON]. It's the affordable housing complex going up, down by FAC0 and FAC1. And, you know, I walk there, I see a lot of people kind of lounging around, and they walk with a different pep in their step."
04_05_2017,affordable housing,"It's an epidemic that nobody's paying attention to. Anytime you walk by an affordable housing unit, look at all that plywood in there. That's 5% to 8% toxic glue."
04_05_2017,affordable housing,"And thank you to [ORGANIZATION] voters for agreeing to dig deep to fund affordable housing. This is a stellar group of people that we are appointing [ORGANIZATION]. And just looking at the range of qualifications around business and equity, older adults, small business, East [ORGANIZATION], fair housing, advocacy, and nuts and bolts in expertise and development."
04_05_2017,housing crisis; affordable housing,"I think this is a firstLOC2rate committee, and so I will simply say thank you to all of the individuals who have agreed to serve. And my nominee is [ORGANIZATION], who I think will bring a unique perspective, both as a person of color, As an [ORGANIZATION] advocate, as someone helping to lead a new business district in LOC1LOC2LOC3, and who is passionate about addressing the affordable housing crisis in our city."
04_05_2017,affordable housing,"So I think we could make that more of our routine again, that would be great. So I wish this committee well and this is an important trust we're giving to this committee to help guide this council in making wise investments with the affordable housing bond measure. PERSON0?"
04_05_2017,affordable housing,We're approving it. I could add a little bit of detail to that. This is a very important effort associated with the  future light rail line that is going to go and serve [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] south and west of that and I think this council has agreed at a very early point that we want to make sure we capture affordable housing opportunities Before the land gets too pricey.
04_05_2017,affordable housing,"So this is what really what these efforts are about working with [ORGANIZATION] The city of [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] and others to really Try to land bank future affordable housing options in [ORGANIZATION] public testimony. I  Good morning. Good morning, Commissioner [PERSON], [PERSON]."
04_05_2017,affordable housing,"There's really not a lot of affordable housing nonprofits that operate in [ORGANIZATION], so that's part of the issue is trying to find them. And I especially appreciate the clarity that the corridor is going to become an increasing use buzzword as we look at mass transit light rail moving into that area. Thank you very much."
04_05_2017,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION], okay. So we've tried to encourage [ORGANIZATION] to have no engagement with using county inmate work crews to [STREET] homeless people to other places. But let the staff person speak if there's anything that's come across in their paperwork that they know of any homeless camping situations here."
04_05_2017,homeless,So I'm asking all these questions because just as we know we have hundreds of people living in cars and RVs. We also have an undetermined number of otherwise homeless people living on our river in vessels. And the mayor suggested [TIME] that we may look at creating a space for these RVs.
04_05_2017,homeless,"And we have to understand is that what we don't see in this ordinance [ORGANIZATION] is that if that quote term homeless person on the boat  is actually determined to be homeless, then I'm asking for an exemption on them from being- I'm sorry to interrupt. Could I ask people who are speaking, could you please keep it down or take it outside so that we can hear? Thank you."
04_05_2017,homeless,"And you do not see that here. Now, when you remove a tent or something on a sidewalk,  Although a bad how bad it is they still have a right technically to go down and try to reclaim that property now What you're doing is you're placing a two to three to five thousand dollar towing fee by your paperwork Which you know there is no homeless boater that can afford that amount of money so they have just lost their boat and I assume they've lost all their possessions and  Because you don't allow them to tie off on these landings which are public properties for [TIME] and again [ORGANIZATION] handles this for you and their position is just get them off the river just get them off the river tow their boat [PERSON] their boat take their possessions and that is their position."
04_05_2017,homeless,"Okay, very good. Well, I think I've made my point, Mayor. And the reality is, be cautious and work with these people that have been determined that they are, quote, what [ORGANIZATION] calls homeless voters."
04_05_2017,affordable housing,"Which is why I think it's so important that we invest in a long term solution, which is a public bank where we have complete control and we can invest  in accordance with our city's values. I think that we need to decouple what is good for us financially from what maximizes Wall [STREET] profits, which is the investments that we're limited to right now. And if we were instead, instead of funding fossil fuel expansion, exploitive human rights abuses and corporate corruption, we should be using our investments to support local affordable housing, sustainable infrastructure and quality education."
04_05_2017,affordable housing,"Maybe here in [ORGANIZATION] we'd decide to focus on building up our affordable housing stock, reinvesting in our schools, or transitioning to sustainable energy or something else. But the point for me is that we should be investing in line with our values and the only [STREET] to do that long term is to control that through a municipal bank. Thank you."
04_05_2017,affordable housing,"It would be run by professional banks, not politicians, and it would be run for the benefit of the city and community. A municipal bank can decrease costs of working with large banks like [ORGANIZATION], saving taxpayers considerable sums on critical infrastructure costs like roads, parks, and affordable housing. Earnings from the bank from loans and interest could then go back into feeding the city coffers rather than the profit margins of Wall [STREET], as we were considering at the beginning of this meeting about our investment potential."
04_05_2017,affordable housing,"So I'm not the most educated on the issue, but off the bat I find it somewhat contradictory. DATE0 we have a room full of people saying affordable housing, a process which companies like [ORGANIZATION] thrive off of, and then [LOCATION] we're saying don't support them. But the thing is their products lie on the shelf."
04_05_2017,homeless,"And as the treasurer was saying, you know, $4.5 million-ish [ORGANIZATION], potentially more [ORGANIZATION], I did some quick math on my own. I'm not as fast as [ORGANIZATION] is. But 4.5 million, that's 285 new units of permanent supportive housing for chronically homeless individuals in our community."
04_05_2017,homeless,"That's 850 [ORGANIZATION] accessible curb ramps. That's 667 additional year round shelter beds based on current costs. And when I was elected, what people told me they wanted to do was  address affordability, address the homeless crisis, improve the policing structure in our community, and fill the dang potholes in front of my house."
04_05_2017,affordable housing,[ORGANIZATION]? I keep thinking of the affordable housing and the shelter beds and the [ORGANIZATION] accessible routes that the Mayor commented on. And I'm very worried about losing 3.5 million in a budget process that we're currently in.
05_12_2016,affordable housing,"I just want to make a brief statement because this has turned out to be surprisingly contentious, and we've heard passionate voices on both sides. Housing advocates have weighed in and see it as a tool for  creating different affordable housing options. Many neighborhoods fear that it means demolishing houses and replacing them with row houses and changing the character of their neighborhoods."
05_12_2016,housing crisis,"The truth is we're in a housing crisis, and we need more places for people to live and for those places to remain affordable. Without conscious design and forethought, we are at risk of creating deeper geographic divisions than we already have. Younger people, people of color, blue-collar workers, older adults, families with children, and people of modest means should not be essentially barred in or out of any neighborhood."
05_12_2016,affordable housing,"And the truth is that throughout our community and in places like [ORGANIZATION], mobile home parks are some of the last affordable housing in our community. And there are tremendous opportunities for us to not only preserve this property,  unique housing stock, but also to help the existing tenants gain some kind of ownership in the mobile home park and to bring some of our other values to play, like green buildings, so that we replace aging, quasi-uninhabitable structures with long-term green and sustainable structures. The truth is, however, that we will not be successful without the city and the county prioritizing this issue."
05_12_2016,affordable housing,"Well, this is exactly the type of discussion we're involved with right now, [ORGANIZATION] with FAC0 on Northeast FAC1 and FAC2. And precisely because the legislature is now allowing us to impose a construction excise tax, these are the types of investments that we hope to be able to preserve and to rehabilitate to make them good, solid, affordable housing. So I appreciate your language, Commissioner [PERSON]."
05_12_2016,homelessness,"I appreciate, Commissioner [PERSON], that – I mean, the other changes to this I support. Rest areas are currently not part of our official policy of how we address homelessness. And to put it in the comp plan as an amendment, I don't think it's appropriate."
05_12_2016,affordable housing,"Aye. PERSON0. Well, I believe that off-[STREET] parking, I think we all know that is a major contributor to the increased cost of construction, therefore increasing cost of affordable housing."
03_25_2015,houseless,"Where I am DATE0 is  with very humbly saying that I'm houseless. And as far as emotional regulation goes, I'm in counseling for complex PTSD with [ORGANIZATION] therapy in mind and trauma recovery exercises. And where I'm going is I'm hoping to reduce my hypervigilance and my inner critic to increase my self-compassion."
03_25_2015,homeless,"It's...  should be used, it should be, could be used as an encampment for homeless people and take care of all the people that are living on the sidewalks and stuff like that. And when it isn't and there's that much land available, that makes me feel bad about my city, the city I live in. We appreciate you bringing that point."
03_25_2015,homeless,"It was a transportation department, and they had the people moved off of it. Here is a [STREET] three.  blocks for all of the homeless people in [ORGANIZATION], and please don't turn that down. That's a wonderful opportunity."
03_25_2015,homeless; homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION] was a part of an article [ORGANIZATION] about homelessness. He said he looked all over [ORGANIZATION], and he couldn't find a [STREET] to move the homeless people into. Well, that is right in our face."
03_25_2015,homeless,"You see, it's right in front of us. It's right in the city of [ORGANIZATION] that all of these homeless people can be moved to. And I'm very sorry."
03_25_2015,homeless,Almost all of the homeless. We hear your point. And I'll understand that that is until I'm explained different.
03_25_2015,homeless,"Our criteria, I believe from the DATE0 ordinance, had a series of criteria that they wanted them all met. This time around, after some discussions, we sort of broadened that to include efficiencies, because when the [ORGANIZATION] customers heard saving money, I think they were equating that with protecting  potentially a budget cut that would come later and it was a little bit harder to assess where those savings might occur so last time around in [LOCATION] you heard from [ORGANIZATION] about a sharing information with the faith-based community and ORG1 and the tool that they wanted to implement would save a lot of time in data entry but it would save it  Some on the city side and also some on the nonprofit side. So the city is getting a better investment in helping their housing programs meet the homeless community needs."
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"So now, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] will present how they've incorporated those amendments into the respective [ORGANIZATION] reports that are in front of us, and we will take testimony, because we're required to do so, on the amendments, only on the amendments, because we closed the hearing on the remainder of these reports. In [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], Commissioner [PERSON]'s office, Commissioner [PERSON]'s office, and my office have discussed  continued to prepare a development solicitation for [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] is preparing a resolution that reflects that work, and I think Commissioner [PERSON] would like to be here and has filed that resolution for consideration DATE2. So for all those reasons, because we're going to take testimony on the amendments [ORGANIZATION], because Commissioner [PERSON] wants to be here and he has a resolution to back up the ORG2's discussion and intent  on affordable housing in that district."
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"And then the second update is actually, once again, a change to language in the report to [LOCATION] that refers to the desire for affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]. So I'll just quickly run through those so everybody has the same information, and then we can take testimony. Thank you."
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"Yeah, I've got, okay, [DATE], yes, thank you. Okay. And then the next one, this is the paragraph that appears in the page 26 of the report that relates to the update to [ORGANIZATION], your renewal plan, and it relates specifically to bringing affordable housing to [PERSON]."
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"Should [ORGANIZATION] dispose of its property in the area, it shall include a requirement for affordable housing or shall be included in a larger development site that will be developed as affordable housing. This requirement may be implemented through a covenant to the deed requiring affordable housing upon the sale or transfer of the city property. And this simply just allows for two different scenarios."
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"One is that the development will occur on the [ORGANIZATION] site, and therefore we meet the requirement there. But it also accounts for what I think is a more likely scenario, which is that when the parcels, because it's not just the [ORGANIZATION] parcel, there's a ORG1 parcel, there's other parcels, when they –  are sold to private or other maybe not-for-profit development interests, depending on the scenario. It may be that projects cut across existing property lines, and we want to account for affordable housing being built in that triangle as opposed to making it required just within a kind of somewhat arbitrary boundary of the [ORGANIZATION] property."
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"Okay, so we'll go reverse order. I'm PERSON0 of FAC0, thanking you for allowing some additional testimony [ORGANIZATION] on the amendments. [ORGANIZATION] obviously has a range of affordable housing currently and encourages that concept."
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"but [ORGANIZATION] should not be the only [STREET] affordable housing is specified council should be enforcing its affordable housing close quotas in the pearl district and in all the uras  I'm also asking the council consider an additional amendment, which would be adding portions to [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] portions, LOC2 and FAC0. If you're serious about development against the FAC1 line, because there are many vacant lots there already, or adding south of FAC2, if you desire continuity of development on both sides of FAC2, And if you look at some of the acreages in question, southeast [PERSON] is roughly 36 acres, public and private, and has two of the light rail stations."
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"The city should stay firm on its requirements as [ORGANIZATION] must commit to making land available for the bridge park and to greenway improvements in exchange for urban renewal dollars. Recently, a more complete summary of the Block 33 transactions between ORG1 and ORG2 became available. The $6 million committed to the now-abandoned Block 33 affordable housing development came from [ORGANIZATION]."
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] has been held up as a textbook example of urban renewal done right. In that case, [ORGANIZATION] were approved simultaneously. All of the planned parks and most of the affordable housing have been successfully developed."
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"This [ORGANIZATION] should take a page from that experience and make adoption of [ORGANIZATION] contingent upon agreements with [PERSON] and ORG2 for parks and affordable housing sites. Short of that, will you commit to the public that, as the city negotiates development agreements, these items will be required in exchange for the millions of dollars that will be invested in the district to the benefit of these property owners? Thank you."
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"I can't speak for the board as a whole, but I can say that I've had multiple conversations recently with board members and with other residents within the neighborhood who express concern about the land use. The loss of affordable housing in our neighborhood, it seems to be really popular, and we're seeing $700,000 homes. So we would very much support an opportunity to regain some of that affordable housing."
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"Obviously, there are many advantages to affordable housing in a [STREET] that is at the nexus of multiple modes of transit and transportation. One of the often stated at one time disadvantages is the presence of heavy rail right along the district, but some of the noise has been recently resolved with a quiet zone. Our neighbors are happy about that."
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"There is a concern about, I've heard recently about, what does affordable housing mean? Does it really mean those people with [ADDRESS] up within their careers and I would hope that this intent is intended for the latter from my experience on the urban renewal area advisory committees that's my understanding  We actually have the option for a park or an open space in that area that I mentioned during my last meeting with you from the money that came to [ORGANIZATION] from the sale of property back to ORG1. I would say that we, many of us within hand, we want to see something that is mixed income housing, not just...  low affordable or low income housing because we think it's a better, it's better for everybody concerned."
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"Thank you. And I think that's everything I wanted to say. Could I just clarify from Commissioner [PERSON], I know that Commissioner [PERSON] has also been working on this, but the intent is affordable housing at 60 percent and less."
03_25_2015,affordable housing,It wouldn't preclude by any means mixed income. But it doesn't mean that we're providing affordable housing necessarily for someone who's a recent college graduate and then going to be moving up. It might very well be 60%.
03_25_2015,affordable housing,It may at that time. We can't select certain types of people that otherwise meet income guidelines and say they can't be eligible. And is the intent of the amendment to say that it will just be affordable housing on that site?
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"We also think with the pending height bonuses for affordable housing, that will further incent development of affordable housing, but  We don't have a specific project in front of us that we're scoping out at this point. I appreciate Ms. [PERSON] bringing this issue up and perhaps [ORGANIZATION] there could be a little more specificity added to the amendment because the [STREET] it reads now is just affordable housing and it doesn't specify is that all of it, half of it, a mixed � does that mean there's two units that are affordable and the rest of it is market-rate?  I don't think we're going to know. PERSON1 may want to comment on that, too."
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"Again, remember, this is an urban renewal plan and a projected –  projected revenues and expenditures not a budget not a project plan and we have so many milestones to pass i mean right now this is a fire bureau maintenance facility right that's what it is if you go you can go there [ORGANIZATION] that's what it is we have a long [STREET] to go from that being a fire bureau maintenance facility to having it be a housing project of any character and what has happened here is the commissioner in charge of [ORGANIZATION] has laid down a marker and said there's going to be affordable housing there And we cannot, we can guess at a number, but that's all we can do [ORGANIZATION]."
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"So could we amend the, it's a policy statement, so we're not going to say there's going to be 200 units of 0 to 60 or whatever, but could we amend it to say there'd be a substantial component of affordable housing? Well, let's let [ORGANIZATION] come back up and comment on that in a bit. He looks like he has a thought or two on that question."
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"Come on up, please. hey there um so i was at the zedel urban hackathon and i actually got an award from them for having an innovative concept of just reducing the cost by having integrated living schooling and startup space but i digress i really would like to see some affordable housing and right now in [ORGANIZATION] they're having a work session on the inclusionary  zoning bill, so it's great that you guys aren't going to vote on that [ORGANIZATION]."
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"It's actually less predictable than what we know in [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION], we know we're talking about new projects. And so you can, you know, there's a lot of experience around doing new construction, affordable housing projects, what you could get for your dollars."
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"In [ORGANIZATION], I think it's more likely that it will be a –  customized mixed-use development, and so how affordable housing appears in the triangle, I think, will be different than what we're talking about in [LOCATION]. That being said, there's probably ways we could craft some minimum. We have to keep in mind that dollars are a lot smaller in LOC2, so the simple math on that would suggest that,  under the city's current formula of subsidizing units, you know, I don't, I mean, we can do the math quickly, but you're talking about something on the order of  you know, [DATE], [DATE], 35 units."
03_25_2015,affordable housing,It's it's so so I we've talked about as Commissioner [PERSON] highlighted that this is a [STREET] where we might be able to get more affordable housing based on different bonuses.
03_25_2015,affordable housing,And and and that might be the most that might be might be the formula that gets us to a bigger number. But we don't know any of that right now. And and an affordable housing alone is not going to.  maximize the development potential of [ORGANIZATION].
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"So I do think we should anticipate that we're going to want to attract other forms of development in the triangle in addition to affordable housing. There just isn't enough, I think, money to make affordable housing happen there without some corresponding market development, whether it's commercial or residential or some other institutional use. Could you point me to where I have the language written down as to what the amendment is?"
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"But this is all still futuristic thinking. I take Ms. [PERSON]'s point and Ms. [PERSON]'s point about  I believe a modicum of affordable housing on this site is appropriate, but how you do that will matter because it's a difficult site. It is next to a freight rail line and a light rail line and a truck corridor and a big..."
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"Okay. I'm comfortable with making a commitment that there's going to be affordable housing there, but not trying to quantify that because that's trying to see around about three or four corners at once, and I don't think we can do that. And can I just clarify from a process standpoint, there will be, in addition to [ORGANIZATION] budgets, the fact that these properties are city-owned and so the disposition will go through city council."
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"And I think, as you just pointed out, there's going to be several bites at this apple that council is going to have as this site, [ORGANIZATION], redevelops. I think this is a pretty substantial commitment to say affordable housing is going to be part of this deal. I'm probably not going to vote for the expansion."
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"I just would like to point out that the language that you have in one instance directs that it will all be affordable housing. [DATE] second says shall be included in a larger development site that will be developed as affordable housing. Boom, that's it."
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"The first half says there will be a requirement for affordable housing. So if that's okay with you, I just want to make that clear. I'm fine."
03_25_2015,homeless,"about homeless folks that were in the park smoking and how the latitude of the law in [ORGANIZATION] and areas of [PERSON], which we are about to adopt, the latitude that the security and the police have for going after people that are smoking is absolutely atrocious and horrible. Okay, we got a gal that had really bad fibromyalgia and the officers there took her down to the ground and tore her up really bad. Okay, it's on the radio, it's all, you can hear it all, it's on the video and such."
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"That's right. Thank you very much Anyone want to speak on this item if not it moves to second reading and option [ORGANIZATION]. Thank you very much Okay, 315  Authorized sale of land at 815 Northwest Nato Parkway to [ORGANIZATION] for approximately $8.8 million to be credited to the affordable housing set-aside budget in the downtown waterfront urban renewal area."
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"With this action, the affordable housing set-aside budget for the downtown waterfront urban renewal area will receive almost $9 million from the pre-agreed land sale and an associated loan payoff. And we have [ORGANIZATION] from [ORGANIZATION] to answer any questions if [ORGANIZATION] Members have them. Questions for [PERSON]?"
03_25_2015,affordable housing,Thank you. And this is $9 million more for the downtown waterfront that can be spent on affordable housing. Aye.
03_25_2015,homeless,"I  I hope that you'll be able to move this forward quickly, and I hope that we will have a little bit more conversation on the ability to literally ban the box in addition to these procedural – there's about 10 pages of [ORGANIZATION] that get into all these little 23 dot this dot that. But most often, and with the T-Streamer exam, I'm here to you about the homeless issue, and I think one problem we've had here is not connecting the dots. If we want to not have 3,000 people sleeping on the streets of [ORGANIZATION], which seems to be the position of the [ORGANIZATION] Business Alliance, and they generally support this ordinance, then we need to have real conversations about the labor market and moving more people into sustainable jobs."
03_25_2015,homeless,I can't get in anywhere. I'm at risk right now being homeless because I can't get in anywhere. I can't even display these in my home because they mean nothing to me anymore.
06_07_2018,homelessness,"Shrink that one a little bit and maybe –  And going forward, this says, you might recognize this, this is based on the Mayor's [ORGANIZATION] dashboard that we released [ORGANIZATION]. This is updated with the adopted budget information, and it's by Mayor's priorities, and you can actually click on the priority here, increasing housing options and reducing homelessness, and see what decision packages are going to that priority area. You can also select by bureau, too, to see which bureau, like [ORGANIZATION], for instance, can see all their decision packages going to that particular category."
06_07_2018,homeless; affordable housing,"So we have it by bureau. And for [ORGANIZATION], for example, their biggest expense is on affordable housing and homeless services. And you can hover over to see what those actual programs are."
06_07_2018,homelessness,"I'm grateful that we're continuing an innovative program launched by [ORGANIZATION] to build capacity in business districts, particularly in [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]. I am pleased that we're continuing to fund our partnership with ORG1. I am thrilled that we have put in record funding to address what I think is morally the most urgent issue of our time, which is homelessness, and the record funding for ORG2 and for addressing other aspects of this crisis I think this council should be very proud of."
06_07_2018,homeless; homelessness,"So I'll be watching that closely. I'm very pleased we increased our commitment to keeping people in their housing through eviction prevention, as well as providing more shelter to people experiencing homelessness. I think we're the only [ORGANIZATION] city that saw a decrease in homeless individuals on the [STREET], not homeless overall, but on the [STREET], which is something to be proud of."
06_07_2018,homeless,"But I hope as the public that we represent evaluates this budget, and I hope they do use the cool budget tool that you outlined earlier, they will see that the priorities that are funded in this budget, I believe, are the same.  are highly consistent with the priorities of the people who live in this community who pay the bills around here. We focused on the homeless issue. We focused on livability issues."
06_07_2018,affordable housing,We focused on affordable housing issues. We focused on public safety issues. We focused on the parks and critical transportation infrastructure.
05_13_2015,homeless,"Thanks very much. Okay, one more, 465. Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding homeless issues."
05_13_2015,homeless; affordable housing,"Basic services like streets, investing in affordable housing, making good on our commitment to public safety, and to changing the relationship between the police bureau and the community through how we deal with people suffering from mental illness, and investing in our kids. This budget reflects about $30.4 million of new funding for basic services, including over $19 million allocated to transportation projects, $6 million for affordable housing and homeless services, and remember that that $6 million proposed is on the budget. on top of more than $90 million already in the city budget for housing from all sources, for a total of nearly $100 million invested into housing."
05_13_2015,affordable housing,"FAC0 is relatively unchanged from a budget perspective. You will see the affordable housing dollars that were moved forward as part of our discussion [ORGANIZATION], but on the ground we are beginning progress on projects like the [ORGANIZATION] project. And then obviously we have the elimination of –  budget for the [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] as well as [ORGANIZATION] which was closed down as a result of the budget amendments."
05_13_2015,affordable housing,"It's a cumulative number, the percentages. So when you look on the right-hand column, if you say, how are we tracking in terms of our set-aside and where are we ending up, you can see that in the [ORGANIZATION] column, the third column there, that's where we'll be as a result of  of our expenditures in affordable housing in [LOCATION]. On the far right is where we're tracking."
05_13_2015,affordable housing,"Okay. Because I think that's a really interesting graphic that you just showed us. And to me, having affordable housing in neighborhoods is part of a healthy neighborhood."
05_13_2015,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], as we talked about earlier, and we've talked about a lot over [ORGANIZATION],  The budget for [ORGANIZATION], if you look out [LOCATION], has pretty much been spoken for through all of our conversations with our partners, whether it be our affordable housing partners with [ORGANIZATION], with [ORGANIZATION], and ORG2. So what you see in the near term in [ORGANIZATION] budget is the money being set aside for the FAC0 that we discussed, the affordable housing project project,  money being set aside for the construction of bond and money beginning to be set aside for the completion of the greenway. Those really are the near-term priorities for the district, in addition to our initial investment in a project alongside [ORGANIZATION] as well."
05_13_2015,affordable housing,"As I mentioned, we still have a significant amount of our $8 million loan to [ORGANIZATION] to disperse, so I'm assuming that will happen in [ORGANIZATION]. So I think what's fascinating about [ORGANIZATION] is if you look at the bar chart here, you have this nice distribution of investments, and I think that really does reflect our ability to invest across a lot of different priority areas, and it's not simply focused on property redevelopment. There's a fair amount that goes into infrastructure, to working with the small business community, and we also obviously have a significant commitment to affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]."
05_13_2015,affordable housing,"I really think that the recent, you know, [ORGANIZATION] budget proposal kind of brings to light a major factor as to why you need to raise to 15 at a bare minimum. We're talking about, [ORGANIZATION] asked the gentleman here, you know, so why is a housing not included? Right.  for healthy complete neighborhoods um it's just my opinion as a Portlander that's kind of a big deal with healthy complete neighborhoods as affordable housing um when the rent going up skyrocketing left"
05_13_2015,homeless,"And we're going to talk about your [TIME] wage and the level of benefits you get. and why you can't find the money to pay the hardworking people who save the lives of the homeless the police push around, $15 an hour at [ORGANIZATION], $15 an hour [PERSON]. You, with your poor policies, make it very difficult."
05_13_2015,affordable housing,"That's appalling and it also makes you feel sort of hopeless like that's so bad. What hope do we have here? Well, I think [ORGANIZATION] proves over and over again on lots of subjects whether it's the environment or Thinking about workers or thinking about affordable housing that we don't want to be a passive passenger on a on a trip We don't want to be on we are going to chart our own course and say no we're gonna actually try to do with our own tools what we can to craft a different kind of economy here and"
05_13_2015,affordable housing,[ORGANIZATION]'s action plan will focus on coordinating internally to better promote affordable housing and housing preservation and economic development. [ORGANIZATION] is working with the [ORGANIZATION] Housing Bureau and the [ORGANIZATION] Development Commission to find opportunities for joint or coordinated actions. And [PERSON] will have a proposed draft [ORGANIZATION] with review time before it goes to the [LOCATION] and ultimately [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION].
05_13_2015,affordable housing,"We are culturally responsive in providing immigration legal services, refugee resettlement, pregnancy and new family support, and licensed adoption services. Our culturally specific services through [ORGANIZATION] serve 15,000 Latino community members [ORGANIZATION], including anti-poverty programs, school-based programs, and [ORGANIZATION], which serves women fleeing domestic violence and sexual assault. We own property within [ORGANIZATION], including offices and affordable housing communities."
05_13_2015,affordable housing,"So housing does have to be addressed separately. We need affordable housing by design and economic prosperity through living wage jobs in the corridor. I've said it in many community spaces, but I do strongly believe that housing is a community right."
05_13_2015,affordable housing,"It's a great, thoughtful planning process. It reminds me of my  my young days when I served on [ORGANIZATION] and how we figured out things like, you know, to do a tunnel or not at the zoo, things like that. So you're grappling with, you know, issues that are very similar, but I think with a new special emphasis on displacement of people and on affordable housing as considerations."
03_06_2019,homeless,"For the record, [ORGANIZATION], and it's [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION], but it's warm enough in here I think that we don't need this. So, we've heard Mr. [PERSON] talk about people in mental health crisis and the number of them that end up dead. We've heard [ORGANIZATION]'s presentation touched on the need to really work with data, and even though we occasionally publish some  I don't know if it's really progress to say that a new [INSTITUTION] is opening up."
03_06_2019,homeless,"Occasionally, the transition projects, the main subcontractor for [ORGANIZATION]...  will do their ORG1 or social media posts that says... I don't know if they did in [ORGANIZATION], because here with [LOCATION] coming in like a lion, two of [DATE] of [LOCATION], weather was so severe that we had emergency shelter open, so they would maybe say the number of people they sheltered, and then talk about four people transitioned into housing. But that really shouldn't be spoken of as an accomplishment necessarily, because what we have is a housing system where there's been...  almost zero growth."
03_06_2019,homeless,"And so when we say somebody was put into housing, what we mean is that another person either lost their housing or lost their life. And for [ORGANIZATION] of the homeless and the housing emergency crisis, we've banded about the number from the point-in-time count. But we've never publicly said  brought forth the funded parties, and worked with the real data."
03_06_2019,homelessness,"The city and the county fund, through a major Fortune 500 corporation, information service products, sometimes called [ORGANIZATION], sometimes called [ORGANIZATION]. And what [ORGANIZATION] really would do, or does, except we don't ask it what it's doing, is it tells us that there are people who have chronic homelessness for [ORGANIZATION]...  and that we intend to extend their homelessness for an equal length of time instead of developing methods to better engage with those people and end their chronic homelessness, which, of course, gets to the point of making homes. It's unfortunate that we're coming up on [ORGANIZATION] since the good people of this county have passed a bond across the [LOCATION] region, and I don't think you could find any ordinary people  who feel they've been engaged in that process."
03_06_2019,homeless,"We have some nice blips on the radar on the horizon, [ORGANIZATION] funding for homeless studies and stuff like that. But I think the answer is with the community, there needs to be more public engagement and honest talk about past mistakes or where we didn't make enough traction. Thank you very much."
03_06_2019,housing crisis,"I think if we're really going to be a smart city, if we're going to really address the housing crisis that we face, some of this information needs to filter out so that we know how many buildings, it's a separate department, but how many buildings are marked with the red [ORGANIZATION], how many are maybe not being as aggressively pursued as nuisances or whatever it takes to get property demolished  in a city that has great need. I'm not the strongest pro-capital, free market real estate person here. Since when I came to the city, we had a big hole in the ground sitting behind [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION]."
03_06_2019,affordable housing,"So one of the other last pieces I just want to mention, as we think about how we grow and trading and evaluating these public goods, we want affordable housing, but we also need quality and livability and sustainability. We are not tracking and measuring these impacts ourselves. So one of the things that we're working on is a sustainability scorecard."
03_13_2019,affordable housing; houseless,"Those who are low income, have disabilities, are people of color and veterans of our generation. We are particularly concerned with the increasing population of houseless elders, the continuing shortage of affordable housing, long waiting lists for public housing meant for elders and people with disabilities, and the often dreadful state of living conditions in available public housing. To this latter end, we unequivocally support the efforts of public housing tenants and indeed any low-income tenants to organize tenant unions such as [ORGANIZATION] to empower themselves for collective demands for better living conditions and treatment."
03_13_2019,housing insecurity,"You're liable to be...  in some situation of housing insecurity or even on the streets while you're waiting. So, you know, that is definitely a concern for, you know, why are people there when there's supposedly a safety net? Because there isn't a big enough safety net, too many holes."
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"And the second is the potential for affordable housing. Currently, the proposal suggests that we could get up to 2,000 units and 40% of them would be available at some point  level of affordability but that's not a promise or a guarantee. It's a possibility and given the city's investment in this area I want to not lose sight of the potential especially given the fact we've got a light rail stop there and it would be just a prime area for affordable workforce housing."
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"And one of the developments that arose as a result of that [ORGANIZATION] was FAC0, which is 40% affordable housing. And that has been an unqualified success in FAC1, a rare success story in FAC1. And I've been talking to the property owners since then, and there's a waiting list for that affordable housing."
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"So one of the catalysts for this new [ORGANIZATION] was to help address that waiting list for affordable housing. Okay. So with that, why don't we switch over to the presentation and I'll kind of walk you through that in a little bit more detail."
03_13_2019,housing crisis,"I have said many times we've always had a housing crisis for someone, but I didn't realize it included [ORGANIZATION]. So, thank you. And full disclosure, Mayor, I did a little research on you and I see you have no connection to [ORGANIZATION]."
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"And I'm not suggesting that we build exactly in [ORGANIZATION] what we built in [PERSON], but  What you've got there in [PERSON] is you've got mixed use right up against the [ORGANIZATION] line. You have shops, restaurants, you have a range of housing options in [PERSON], and again including affordable housing. There is a strong partnership between [ORGANIZATION] and affordable housing partners."
03_13_2019,affordable housing,Right. And I just want to also add that there's a human solutions building that's going up there with affordable housing. So I know that this community has been really intentional about the concern that Commissioner [PERSON] and I share.
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"And what I'm, what we've been very intentional, Commissioner, in our discussion with the developers about incorporating affordable housing. I'm not, I don't work for [ORGANIZATION], but I'm obviously well aware of the need for affordable housing. So that has been front and center in our discussions all the [STREET] through."
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"So when you say affordable housing, what do you mean? Again, I'm not a housing expert, but whatever the definition is of affordable housing, the intent here is that 40% of the units that are built will be affordable. It will probably be 60% to 80% MFI, which is basically..."
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"I mean, I think it's important that we actually say the number as compared to using the term affordable housing because that's such an oxymoron statement, right? Because I can't tell you what's affordable for you, and you certainly can't tell me what's affordable for me. But we need to know what is the income you need to live there."
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"But, again, I just want to emphasize affordable housing in no [STREET], shape, or form has been an afterthought to this discussion. So...  So you saw the pictures of what this area of FAC0 looks like [ORGANIZATION]. This is an architectural rendering of what we would like FAC0 to become."
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"But when we're talking about market rate housing and affordable housing, when we're putting 1,500 to 2,000 housing units in here, that creates a lot more housing options for everyone. And then my last slide here is the other corner of this area of FAC0. This is at FAC1 and Everett [STREET]."
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"Yeah, Commissioner, we traditionally haven't done development agreements on [ORGANIZATION]s, but there are certainly deal points, if you will, on the funding. And so the funding of the second [ORGANIZATION] that we want, I mean, the first [ORGANIZATION] is fully funded, so that's not an issue. But if we think about bringing that second [ORGANIZATION] forward, we're looking at some markers in terms of number of certain blocks developing and a Commissioner [PERSON]'s point about,  ensuring that affordable housing is part of that component as well."
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"But just know that I'm concerned that we don't have a model yet of how we've done this right. So I would love to see this one be a model of how we've done it right. And that real affordable housing, a real housing that people can afford to live in is a result of the actions that were taken."
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"So if council wants to include a finding or a directive in there that says it's going to be 40% affordable housing, you know, whatever...  Whatever issues are important to the council, we can absolutely embed those in a formation ordinance for sub-signalities. I want to raise a cautionary flag on that. I do not support that strategy because that backs us into a financial model that we may or may not be able to afford, and it may create a market dynamic that that community just can't support."
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"You'll also need to share in the cost of the infrastructure and affordable housing because it's impossible to simply get that by planning and requirements. Otherwise, we'd have it there by now. Mainly, I just encourage you to get to know these property owners, and they're going to be here [ORGANIZATION]."
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"In the past, I have worked for a developer that has built multi-use tax-exempt properties in northeast [ORGANIZATION], and instead of, I took it upon myself to not just allow them to be  allow the affordable housing. I wanted to make sure that I was reaching out to the community, that I was doing what was best for our residents. So in [ORGANIZATION], I've had open communications with [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, [PERSON], the [LOCATION]-BASH program, and [ORGANIZATION], and many more."
03_13_2019,affordable housing,And I find that this particular site is very interesting because there's –  a lot of the problems of the city are present on the site currently and yet there is a tremendous opportunity there. I saw that as one of the prime areas that I would like to personally participate in bringing in some businesses. I think that the timing of some of the development is something that the council could certainly push in a direction that would make it much easier to get things to happen more quickly and to address the affordable housing.
03_13_2019,homelessness; affordable housing,"For example, if you  put the affordable housing units up first, then you're not going to have a whole bunch of people worried about, um, not being able to have housing. And it also provides, uh,  places for workers to live, potentially if they're coming in from out of town. Likewise, the problem of the homelessness in the city in that particular area is particularly acute as you're near the highway."
03_13_2019,homeless,"There's lots of danger or perceived danger in the homeless. I've actually been underground as a homeless person. four or five of [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION], in [ORGANIZATION], in various places in [ORGANIZATION], and also in GPE2 and in [LOCATION] for 80 percent of [LOCATION], even though that wasn't my intent when I got here."
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"I know we need a lot more affordable housing, but we also need market rate housing. We need to have a good mixture of both. And the projects that will follow this [ORGANIZATION] will have a good mix, not a separate building for the people who can only afford the affordable and another building for the people who have a little more money, but they're mixed together in housing units."
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"We're seeing displacement occurring now, not from this project, just from gentrification in the area. It is happening now. Our housing bureau is looking at a preference policy for affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION] because of that displacement."
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"But I want to speak to the money. I mean, I don't think that having that much affordable housing with that kind of criteria is realistic, especially not in this town. How about people with no income like me?"
03_13_2019,houseless,That's stupid. How better to educate people that houseless people and people of low income are no different than you and me than to put everybody together in one box and have them play together? But I don't understand why it is that more people aren't being helped through this.
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"And I'm going to be looking for, like, real numbers and not just terms like affordable housing. Because, again, I don't think that term means anything anymore, right? I think what we need to talk about is making sure we have housing at every income level, in every neighborhood in the city of [ORGANIZATION], and that [ORGANIZATION] could possibly be that model."
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"We now have staff in the room. amend affordable housing preservation and [ORGANIZATION] renter additional protections to make technical changes following adoption of SB608, other technical changes, and clarify the affordable housing exemption. Colleagues with the city's commissioner, please."
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"We are clarifying a couple of key places in the ordinance that don't change the policy but add clarity to both landlords and tenants. and we are narrowing the exemption for affordable housing providers. As you may recall, when this ordinance was permanently adopted in [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] directed us to convene stakeholders to narrow and refine the affordable housing exemption."
03_13_2019,homelessness,"Aye. When we passed the first temporary relocation assistance ordinance in [ORGANIZATION], we had high hopes for its ability to create a lifeline for vulnerable tenants teetering on the edge of homelessness. I'm pleased to say [PERSON] that not only does data demonstrate that it works, but I believe it was one of several catalysts that spurred greater tenant protections for residents, all renting residents in the state of [ORGANIZATION] through [LOCATION] [DATE]."
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"And in fact, within our [ORGANIZATION] member group, we have seen more ridership and folks riding all throughout [ORGANIZATION], including [LOCATION], compared to other conventional ORG1 members. So the [STREET] that [ORGANIZATION] works is that members can sign up online and pay $3 a month by linking their credit or debit card or by choosing the cash option. Portlanders are eligible if they're FAC0 cardholders, residents of affordable housing, if they qualify for utility assistance or other social services."
03_13_2019,homelessness,"So here we see a snapshot of growth for the program. As of [ORGANIZATION], there were 495 [ORGANIZATION] members, riding over 66,000 trips in total, which is about 20% of all [PERSON] trips, all [PERSON] member trips. We've made improvements, have done outreach in populations that tend to get overlooked, such as our populations experiencing homelessness, joblessness, or going through recovery."
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"We strive to facilitate health equity in our communities. This means engaging communities most impacted by health disparities and acknowledging and addressing current and historic injustices and discrimination. Our prioritized community health needs, which [STREET] our areas of focus and investment, include access to health care, economic opportunity, including investments in affordable housing, oral health, mental health and wellness, and chronic disease prevention and treatment."
03_13_2019,homelessness,"I'm [PERSON], and I'm the Executive Director of [ORGANIZATION]. We are a [ORGANIZATION] newspaper that creates income opportunities for people struggling with homelessness and poverty. We work with about 160 people a week."
03_13_2019,homeless,About half of whom are homeless who come to our office to purchase issues for [DATE] that they can then sell for a dollar. So it's a [STREET] to get cash in pocket. It's a [STREET] to get a hand up.
03_13_2019,housing crisis,We often talk about the housing crisis that... Welcome. Thank you.
03_13_2019,homeless; homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION] provides career track training and employment services to reduce poverty and increase prosperity and housing stability. [ORGANIZATION] funding for ORG2 is about $2.7 million, which pays for career coaching provided by a network of 12 community-based partners who serve about 1,900 [ORGANIZATION] through this program. These partners bring strong connections and expertise in serving the program's target populations, including homeless, people at risk of homelessness, ex-offenders, immigrants, residents of neighborhood prosperity initiatives, and communities of color."
03_13_2019,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] situates these partners within a system of resources and services that augment funding for career coaching, multiply the impact of the city's investment, and improve services and outcomes. Building on the city's investment, we incorporate an array of additional funding and services from the [ORGANIZATION] ORG1, [ORGANIZATION] ORG2, [ORGANIZATION] ORG3, [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION], and other sources to add over $7 million into the program [DATE]. This includes about $3.5 million to fund more career coaches to serve even more [ORGANIZATION], about $2 million to provide occupational training for participants focusing on target sectors of healthcare, construction, advanced manufacturing, high-tech, truck driving, and financial industry, about $900,000 in on-the-job training and internships for people who lack work experience or recent work experience,  and about $800,000 for rent assistance so that people who are homeless or facing eviction can participate in occupational training and start a job with the result that they can get a job that supports their housing."
03_13_2019,homeless,"So the most vulnerable population includes homeless and housing insecure residents, about 26%. Justice-involved individuals, 38% of self-report involvement with the criminal justice system, 10% of immigrants and refugees and English language learners, 50% of people we serve currently are long-term unemployed,  have been looking for work for [ORGANIZATION], according to [ORGANIZATION] statistics definition. And 57% hold a high school diploma [ORGANIZATION] or less."
03_13_2019,homeless; homelessness,"And, you know, average is not always makes a true story. For example, during [ORGANIZATION] under the work systems contract, we served 400 chronically homeless people and their average wage is $11.30, you know, average over [LOCATION], which  which sounds lower than minimum wage right now, but it's a great accomplishment for people who experience this homelessness. And with our additional or another economic opportunity program, that is a program that serves professional immigrants and refugees in  their average wage is $16.84."
03_13_2019,homelessness; affordable housing,"She met with a few of our employees and heard about the work that we were doing cleaning our streets and sidewalks. [ORGANIZATION] is a nonprofit direct service organization that provides integrated primary and behavioral health care, supportive and affordable housing to people impacted by homelessness in [ORGANIZATION] area. [ORGANIZATION] operates about 2,000 units of affordable housing and serves 9,000 patients [ORGANIZATION] through the 13 federally qualified health centers."
03_13_2019,homeless,"And I'm here [ORGANIZATION] to talk to you about our employment services programs.  that worked with 1,200 people over [LOCATION], a majority of whom were homeless, and placed over 750 of them into employment at over 300 employers. [ORGANIZATION] is one of our largest funders that enabled us to help these clients. But let me back up because I want you to know a bit more about our clients."
03_13_2019,homelessness,"In fact, most of our career coaches were initially clients that received support from [ORGANIZATION]' [PERSON]. So those career coaches have actually come to this work with lived experience in poverty, homelessness, and substance use disorders. So when they are out there talking to our clients about the possibility of starting a new chapter in their lives, they know better than any of us the power of that possibility."
03_13_2019,homelessness,"As an organization, our priority population is African American young adults [ORGANIZATION], perhaps the city's most vulnerable population in terms of outcomes, experiences of violence, poverty, and unemployment. Homelessness impacts this population at higher rates than others and is often uncounted and unseen in many ways. This is why we are so grateful for the city's commitment to this program."
03_13_2019,homelessness,A great example of a success from this program comes from a current participant. [ORGANIZATION] is an African-American single mom with three young children. She connected with [ORGANIZATION] and our program when she was behind in rent payments and at risk of homelessness.
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] serves low-income people living in [ORGANIZATION]. And in addition to our employment programs, we also have housing programs and run affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] has been part of ORG1 since the beginning."
03_13_2019,homeless; homelessness,"First, we operate four EOP career coaching programs that are funded through the city and additional resources made available by work systems. We have our [ORGANIZATION] EOP serving [ORGANIZATION]ers in poverty who are at risk of homelessness. We also have a program serving homeless [ORGANIZATION]ers that are on [ORGANIZATION],  We have a program serving people interested in pursuing healthcare careers, that's our [ORGANIZATION] program, and a program serving people re-entering the community from incarceration."
03_13_2019,homeless,"Our [ORGANIZATION] program gave additional capacity to work with participants reentering the community from incarceration, and our [ORGANIZATION] opportunity to support our participants getting into the healthcare field, one of the fastest-growing industries in [ORGANIZATION]. In addition, we serve as the system-wide rent assistance hub, providing rent assistance for participants from across the program who are homeless or being evicted. Through this service, we have about 100 people served through housing assistance from either being evicted or being placed into housing."
03_13_2019,homelessness,"Because of the work that [ORGANIZATION] does in general, we know that the issues of homelessness, housing, and employment are interrelated. And we want to thank you for your support for this program that's been a lifeline to the communities we serve. So thank you, Mayor and Commissioners, for your continued support."
03_13_2019,homelessness,"I work with our partners, many like [ORGANIZATION] and some of the others that are here, to help bridge the gap between adversity and opportunity, between despair and hope, and often the  difference between housing and homelessness. I'll share quite briefly the story of [ORGANIZATION], one of our pre-apprentices, who is not here [ORGANIZATION] to represent himself because he got called into work. So he was very much a success story of one of our individuals who went through our pre-apprenticeship program."
03_13_2019,homeless,"I started off [ORGANIZATION] trying to get into the healthcare field here in [ORGANIZATION], and I went through the whole being homeless, in and out of the shelters, staying on people's couches, just trying to get another chance at life. Basically, I went to [ORGANIZATION] where they had the ORG1 program. They had a lottery that was going on."
05_30_2018,affordable housing,"And inclusionary zoning, which we now have. Housing acquisition rehabilitation. No net loss affordable housing preservation ordinance."
05_30_2018,housing crisis,And thank you for listening to us [ORGANIZATION] and for your support for [ORGANIZATION]. I'm [PERSON] and I am a co-chair of [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] continues to feel the harsh effects of our housing crisis.
05_30_2018,affordable housing,"And I hope you'll be ready to do your part by passing a tenant protection ordinance on [ORGANIZATION] that the state grants you that authority. Another city legislative priority was HJR 201, which is a state constitutional amendment that's been referred to [LOCATION]'s ballot. It will repeal a DATE2 provision that limits the ability of the city to stretch its affordable housing dollars further."
05_30_2018,homeless,"That fund will support homeownership opportunities and permanently affordable homes for low-income people and veterans, and will bring millions to [ORGANIZATION] to help transition homeless people off the streets. We've been close partners with [ORGANIZATION] in developing [ORGANIZATION] code amendments that you'll consider [ORGANIZATION], and we're happy to say that several EPAP suggestions are part of the [ORGANIZATION]'s recommendation. We've pressed [PERSON] to include a robust component of permanently affordable homes in their future plans for the ORG2 property."
05_30_2018,homelessness,So I was charged with coming out to [ORGANIZATION] to see how homelessness affected youth differently than the youth downtown. One of the first places my boss directed me to plug myself into the happenings of [ORGANIZATION] was [ORGANIZATION]. So that was one of my first charges when I first got hired was plug yourself into [ORGANIZATION] so that you can know what's going on in [ORGANIZATION].
04_08_2015,homeless,"And in fact, the principal and assistant principal estimate that about 20% of those students are technically homeless. And about another 25% live in trailer parks or in public housing. The diversity is rich."
04_08_2015,houseless,"Okay, item 349, please. Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding houseless issues. Ms. [PERSON], are you here?"
04_08_2015,affordable housing,and i i'm reminded that um you know in some affordable housing development the city has funded with the best of intentions we've built in the commercial space on the ground floor but it's been very slow to lease up so at some point here it's a laudable goal but someone is someone is is picking up the tab on an underutilized space where perhaps we were somewhat ahead of the market even though it was at the right location and the right concept so i think that's  That's the balancing part.
04_08_2015,affordable housing,"And I'm also reminded that we have a housing shortage in [ORGANIZATION], a terrible housing shortage in affordable housing and low-income housing. And I don't like the term affordable housing because it's a misnomer. So let's talk about low-income housing."
04_08_2015,affordable housing,"We're losing our affordable housing. You know, we're losing, [ORGANIZATION]'s in my neighborhood. He's coming to us in [ORGANIZATION] with the development."
04_08_2015,affordable housing,We'll be nice to him. We're losing affordable housing as we're tearing down the weak and the sick and everything in the wildfire. And we're not replacing it in kind.
04_08_2015,affordable housing,"Used to be you could buy a house for $200. Now people are selling their bungalows for $400, and they're being demolished and replaced with $800,000 homes. We hear all the concerns in neighborhoods about the lack of affordable housing, about the impact on neighborhoods, on and on and on."
04_08_2015,homeless,"We've taken in its low income housing, we've taken in its,  the homeless. We've got [ORGANIZATION] around there. Let's let some other part of town take the brunt of this for a while."
04_08_2015,affordable housing,"Let's put some GPE0 Luz and some affordable housing in other areas, not the [ORGANIZATION]. Let's let the [ORGANIZATION] be a  In that area of FAC0 and what we're talking about is a condo area, not an apartment area. And a 16-story condo will take away all of my, any sunlight that I ever have a chance of seeing looking to the west."
03_24_2016,affordable housing,"While these projects are primarily focused on data gathering and analysis…  They serve the larger purpose of helping the [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] to better understand the baseline of affordable housing that is currently available and assist in measuring progress as the [ORGANIZATION] works to meet the affordable housing and equity needs of our community. Thank you. PERSON0, I just have one question."
03_24_2016,affordable housing,"On public projects, CBAs can be negotiated with the initiating government agency and can be included in requests for proposals with contractors. With private developers, benefits can be negotiated in a contract. And, you know, in the past, CBAs have funded workforce training, local hiring, child care access, affordable housing units, relocation stipends, and reforced access to family wage jobs and other public benefits."
03_24_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"And for the record, my name is [ORGANIZATION], and I co-chair [ORGANIZATION] with [ORGANIZATION], Executive Director of [ORGANIZATION]. During [ORGANIZATION], ORG2 has been the focus of much of [PERSON]'s work. We appreciate [LOCATION] work on affordable housing and homelessness, and [PERSON] wants to continue to work with the [ORGANIZATION] and other partners so the progress continues."
03_24_2016,affordable housing,"DATE0, we formed [ORGANIZATION], and myself and [ORGANIZATION] were asked to co-chair it. And we were a unique group because we had developers of affordable housing such as [ORGANIZATION], as well as people like myself who only knew education and knew very little about housing and its complexity, and felt affordable housing was the cause of many of the problems in [LOCATION]. But that evening when we met, we came up with a common goal within [TIME]."
03_24_2016,homeless,"Recently, [ORGANIZATION] reports a 60% increase in homeless families in [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION]. Their new family shelter was overflowing as soon as it opened on [LOCATION]. As of DATE2, [ORGANIZATION] counted 420 homeless students during [ORGANIZATION], identified under Title X, which is where you identify homeless because they get special services."
03_24_2016,homeless,"This exceeds the number of [ORGANIZATION] with [LOCATION] left to go in [DATE]. In fact, [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], 79 new students were newly identified as homeless. The numbers keep climbing as rents increase."
03_24_2016,affordable housing,Here is the summary of our top priorities. Establish policy and practices that balances regional affordable housing supply and promotes fair share across [ORGANIZATION]. The legislature just removed the statewide ban on inclusionary zoning.
03_24_2016,affordable housing,"GPORG00 has a large quantity of rundown private market apartment buildings that could be acquired and preserved for affordable housing. ORG0ORG1ORG2 is pleased that [PERSON] and the Mayor's budget recommends $1.5 million for [ORGANIZATION] in GPORG00 DATE0. And then finally, homeowner retention."
03_24_2016,homeless,"Thank you. Thank you. PERSON0, did I hear that number right about the number of homeless students at FAC0? 422, is that right?"
03_24_2016,homeless,"420, and that was as of [ORGANIZATION]. Basically, with Title X, that's some funding we get for federal for homeless that they can get if they live outside the district because a homeless child can go to any school. And is transportation, et cetera, that they can receive besides a special assistant?"
03_24_2016,homeless,"So that's how we kind of count them when they are identified and registered that [STREET]. And by that definition of homeless, they could be sleeping in a car, couch surfing, all kinds of different ways of getting by. Yeah, that's homeless and kind of has a broad definition."
03_24_2016,homeless,"Probably not, but at least they made contact with the school. They wanted to be in school. And what we're finding, as you know with a lot of the information, there's a lot more newly homeless families, and they want to stay in school."
06_01_2022,affordable housing,"Thank you.  [ORGANIZATION]. I want to again thank and staff for their thanks staff for their work on this and all the residents who testified affordable housing providers and many, many other stakeholders who are engaged, who we heard from in [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] was a national leader on this issue with [PERSON] one."
06_01_2022,homelessness,"So the issue of facilitation is one that's interesting to me. And given the work that we do here on city council, which is always, every issue that comes here is controversial, if it's dealing with homelessness, if it's dealing with public safety, if it's dealing with livability issues, if it's dealing with [PERSON], economic recovery, you name it, facilitation is key. And I have found the difference between a good outcome and a bad outcome is often,  good facilitation versus bad facilitation."
06_01_2022,homelessness,"Now, if you go back just [ORGANIZATION] and ask the average person planning a vacation or the average convention planner what comes to mind when they thought about [ORGANIZATION], they would have probably mentioned our great restaurants or beautiful natural areas. However, in [LOCATION], when we asked potential visitors what came to mind when they thought about [ORGANIZATION], too often the answer was homicides and homelessness. The damage done by [PERSON] and the damage done to our reputation decimated our local hospitality industry."
06_01_2022,affordable housing,"It also included the community benefit agreement term sheet between [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] and ORG2, which [ORGANIZATION] had been a party to the negotiations of, which includes application of the city [ORGANIZATION] policy and community benefit expectations attached to future affordable housing,  and the infrastructure. [ORGANIZATION] and the city are honoring the spirit of the community benefit agreement negotiations by aggregating the public investments across the projects and applying the city's [ORGANIZATION] to the site prep work led by [ORGANIZATION] and the proposed infrastructure projects contemplated by the ORG4. [ORGANIZATION] also approved a development and disposition agreement term sheet between [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] Partners outlining the terms and conditions for property transactions and development on a portion of the site."
06_01_2022,affordable housing,"The city's investments of approximately $33.5 million outlined in the intergovernmental agreements [ORGANIZATION] will leverage approximately $1.6 billion in outside capital to deliver on this project over [LOCATION] and return nearly $100 million in direct revenue to the city. Next slide please. The critical steps that must be taken on the path toward development of phase one of the [ORGANIZATION] corridor, which includes affordable housing and private commercial development, includes demolition of the main [ORGANIZATION] facility and remediation of environmental contamination at the site, and then the subsequent construction of ORG1, ORG2, and the off-site utilities, which are necessary to service the district and vertical development."
06_01_2022,affordable housing,"So before I turn it over to [ORGANIZATION], I really want to talk through the four key reasons that we believe that these agreements and the related actions are both timely and relevant. The first is that the adopted master plan includes  defines the required infrastructure necessary for any development to occur. This means that development at this site, whether it's an affordable housing project, by a non-profit or a private commercial development, will require these improvements regardless of what is being built."
06_01_2022,affordable housing,"So these investments are evergreen in nature. If we delay investments in the infrastructure, we delay development and the related equitable community benefits. Timeliness is especially relevant given the Metro Housing Bond resources identified for Phase 1 of the affordable housing."
06_01_2022,affordable housing,"collectively this phase zero body of work will be completed by [ORGANIZATION] which then unlocks approximately 70 percent of the site's development potential this includes an initial affordable housing project on parcel 4a shown here which we anticipate will accommodate approximately 250 units serving portlanders earning up to 60 percent of area median income  With this development, we can also complete a final relocation of the post office retail to the northeast portion of the site in a building tucked under FAC0. This allows for the demolition of the existing parking structure and allows for the extension of FAC1 in the streets [ORGANIZATION], the extension or the construction of the [PERSON] area and completion of LOC2, which is contemplated in the open space [ORGANIZATION] before you. This also unlocks the remaining parcels of development, including a second affordable housing project."
06_01_2022,affordable housing,"So we need that development to occur so that we can relocate the post office. At that time, we can take down the existing parking garage, which [ORGANIZATION] obstructs the footprint of FAC0 and the park, as well as the second phase of affordable housing. So we need the time to complete that relocation and demolition."
06_01_2022,affordable housing,"We've contracted with [ORGANIZATION] and with [ORGANIZATION] to advise us. We're going to have a conversation with our board in [ORGANIZATION] to share some of that and we'll follow up with you as well in [ORGANIZATION] and [LOCATION] to really discuss what the findings are. I think, you know, we know that there are resources that are available for affordable housing."
06_01_2022,affordable housing,"So we just want to end by appreciating and acknowledging that this vision, bringing this vision to life does require significant public investment.  and just expressing that we believe that this investment does deliver significant returns to our community, will deliver significant returns to our community over [ORGANIZATION] through the creation of welcoming open space, multimodal infrastructure, increased access to quality jobs and affordable housing in a mixed-income community, and accommodating anticipated growth in a sustainable manner. So with that, we are just happy to take any questions that you might have.  Very good colleagues. Any questions at this point?"
06_01_2022,affordable housing,BUT THAT DOES REMAIN A RISK TO THE CITY AND TO GPE0. WE ALSO HAVE  Opportunity costs were so say with [ORGANIZATION]. They have the ability right now to secure FAC0 housing bond funds to deliver on affordable housing.
06_01_2022,housing crisis,They did step up and they gave us access to a facility that they were using for training. so that we could address the housing crisis. And I want to stress that I appreciate that.
05_04_2016,homeless,"Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding homeless sweeps and civil rights, human rights violations by the city. Good morning. So my name is [ORGANIZATION]."
05_04_2016,homeless,"I'm with [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]. And it looks like I chose a slot DATE0 for something that's pretty timely [LOCATION]. DATE2 you guys swept out up to 400 people they were forcefully evicted off the spring water trail including homeless people that are mentally ill handicapped have brain injuries abuse trauma victims victims of sex trafficking like these uh  folks just talked about, you know, victims of child sex trafficking, slavery, all this various stuff, and you guys just continue to wage your little cultural cleansing war against the homeless."
05_04_2016,homeless,"And I saw, you know, that wasn't the only thing you guys have recently done. You recently cleared out the  homeless people under FAC0, too, and you're going up to [ORGANIZATION] and you're getting ready for [LOCATION]. And you want to know what?"
05_04_2016,homeless,"I hear there's a lot of rumblings about how [LOCATION] going to be shut down by all the homeless activists. And a bunch of those 450 people that got forcefully evicted will actually be blocking [LOCATION]. So, you know, so you're building a big resistance and resentment, okay?"
05_04_2016,homeless,"And not only did you sweep the people out, oh, [ORGANIZATION] leased the land to [PERSON] so they could fence it off. I think that's totally illegal, actually. I don't see how [ORGANIZATION] can even be authorized to just simply...  lease out land to a quasi-city agency like [PERSON], and especially under your little homeless state of emergency farce that you guys have been pushing."
05_04_2016,homeless,"Yeah, one of the best ways to become homeless in [ORGANIZATION], I hear, is to join the military. Because then you become homeless. And then you just become worthless to your country once you've served it."
05_04_2016,affordable housing,"And we want city leaders to be aware of these issues and be aware of these findings and recommendations. Certainly as the city moves forward with things like affordable housing, construction and development, transit zones, et cetera, we would urge care with our public dollars as a [STREET] to support good jobs and safe working conditions as part of our social equity imperative. Thank you."
05_04_2016,housing crisis,"Thanks. Good morning. As [ORGANIZATION] mentioned, [ORGANIZATION]'s growing [ORGANIZATION] communities face a lack of living wage jobs with which to support their families, a housing crisis that is pushing more and more [ORGANIZATION]s out of the city altogether, and growing anti-immigrant sentiment reflected in English-only ballot measures and other campaigns to blame.  so-called others for our problems."
05_04_2016,affordable housing,"At [ORGANIZATION], we believe that our communities find strength in a powerful political voice shaped by self-determination and our diverse cultural and ethnic heritages. We believe that the root causes of inequity are interconnected, and thus we organize and advocate on a range of issues ranging from educational equity for English language learners, ethnic studies, to anti-displacement and affordable housing, and transportation and climate justice. We invest in political education to understand the systems that create inequities and to focus on developing leaders who can work collectively to identify problems, make demands, and win concrete changes for our communities."
05_04_2016,homeless; affordable housing,"I will also mention that Commissioner [PERSON], one term of the intergovernmental agreement is for the city to devote any proceeds exceeding $389,000 from the de-transfer of the building to an affordable housing or [INSTITUTION] program mutually agreed upon by the ORG0 Commissioner and [ORGANIZATION] Officer. So there is that component that that was part of this whole mega deal with [ORGANIZATION] and the park property. So as I say, we've been working on it for quite some time, and I think it really is potentially a win-win-win."
05_04_2016,homeless,"What gives you the right to sweep? You're all involved in this, even if it is different cabinets that run different parts of it. I've heard people, and I have read of people coming and talking to you about homeless."
05_04_2016,homeless,"God, forever. Doing anything about it? Now, you look at the count of the people and homeless, what was it, 1,800?"
05_04_2016,homeless,"I think the last count was up 11%, something like that. You scratch a little deeper, you see that there were 600-some-odd people that weren't included in the count because they didn't want to wake them, because they didn't want to participate, because, because, because. As I mentioned to you before, we have over 10,000 homeless on the streets."
05_04_2016,homeless,I gave a friend of mine a heart attack urge. He came out homeless again. He got [ORGANIZATION] in a [STREET] to stay.
05_04_2016,homeless,"Authorize a competitive solicitation for treatment readiness services, transitional housing, and follow-up retention support services to chemically dependent homeless adult chronic arrestees for an [ORGANIZATION] cost of $1,716,410. So this was filed in error and needs to be returned to my office, and if there's no objection, I'll do that. Okay, it's returned to my office."
05_04_2016,homelessness,"Underrepresented and marginalized youth isn't just folks of color or youth of color. It's also young people who are undocumented, LGBTQ young people. We also represent gang-affected, [ORGANIZATION] and HIV-positive youth, youth with disabilities, youth experiencing foster care and homelessness and living in shelters, youth who have experienced genocide and domestic violence  and sexual assault, racial profiling, and displacement."
03_20_2019,affordable housing,"She believed our city could be fair and equitable, protect the environment, preserve historic homes, and provide affordable housing, and distribute sidewalks, parks, and swimming pools to all corners of our community. Thank you. In [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] was one of a small group of citizens that was helping city employees like me figure out what the authors of ballot measure 37 had intended and do it fast."
03_20_2019,housing crisis; affordable housing,We have a tremendous housing crisis. There's a huge need. We have lots of people looking for affordable housing.
03_20_2019,affordable housing,That's what we spent [ORGANIZATION] doing as well when you came before [ORGANIZATION]. But I also want to just acknowledge that [PERSON]'s report highlighted many significant outcomes in [DATE]. There were two buildings opened in [DATE] providing 132 more units of affordable housing within the interstate corridor.
03_20_2019,affordable housing,"As has been acknowledged, we have much further to go. Our city is seeing a massive investment in affordable housing construction and we must improve the ways in which these opportunities are shared for all people in our community, making sure that we're hiring minority contractors and creating a broad array of economic and housing opportunities. As has  has been noted in the report."
03_20_2019,homeless,"You don't need a special...  thing from the city attorney to do that you as a citizen can can go and and [ORGANIZATION] for a restraining order. I don't see how how that changes anything, but I don't think that I  In situations of great catastrophe, like we're the second largest homeless population in the nation, I don't think where there's government incompetence that you should be protected by the city attorney. Thank you."
03_20_2019,homeless,"And do we anticipate people moving back into that building, or are they permanently relocated? Well, this provides permanent relocation assistance, but we will be programming the property to serve people coming from potentially the homeless system and people who need additional services who meet the [ORGANIZATION] requirement.  definition and also we're hoping to provide project-based section 8 vouchers so we would welcome those folks back to return if they would so choose. So that's permanent supportive housing for people who don't know what the acronyms stand for?"
03_20_2019,homeless,"and then you're going to spend money to demolish the building, and then you're going to rebuild, and that's going to be more money, and you haven't housed a single homeless person. And congratulations on that. And congratulations on, in [ORGANIZATION], you rejected FAC0, which would have housed 92 homeless people,"
03_20_2019,homeless,"And he went up to [ORGANIZATION] and they gave him $12 million and he will be housing 72 people in buildings, eight to a building. And then 20 tiny homes, those 20 timely homes, are being built by a [ORGANIZATION] construction company. A [ORGANIZATION] construction company is building housing for homeless people in [ORGANIZATION]."
03_20_2019,homeless,"Not homeless people in [ORGANIZATION], homeless people in [PERSON]. And [ORGANIZATION] has the second highest homeless population in the nation after GPE2,  Then it goes [PERSON], and then I think it goes [PERSON], and then GPE4. We are the second highest homeless population in the nation, and you are building housing for people in [PERSON]."
03_20_2019,homeless,"Fortunately, [ORGANIZATION], some of these people are in active addiction, and maybe it's good that there's a management company that's going to help them find stabilized housing instead of giving them a cash settlement. But all the other homeless people in this town, you know,  saw that the right response to y'all was to kill herself by setting herself on fire. And that's kind of how some other homeless people in this town feel when we see $20,000 per person allocated."
03_20_2019,homeless,"And then the West one will be rebuilt to modern standards, and it will allow at least the same number of people, but probably more. That is my hope. And that will be consistent with this city's and the county's policy, which we adopted DATE0 around addressing the issue of the chronically homeless on our [STREET]."
01_18_2018,affordable housing,And I know there have been discussions about the economics of the affordable housing market. There's been the issue of construction cost increase adding to the cost of affordable housing. There have been some who have raised the question as to whether the inclusionary housing process itself has slowed housing production.
01_18_2018,affordable housing,"Downtown is the [STREET] where we should be building our highest and largest building. Views from existing buildings are not protected and should be expected to change as the city grows. The new buildings will include affordable housing, which is much needed, and FAC0 site especially will provide 500 units of affordable housing."
01_18_2018,affordable housing,"The amendment's only substantive zoning criteria being upzoned for FAC0 eight acres is building height, and that height is consistent with [ORGANIZATION]. Secondly, the description about the potential for such a large number of affordable housing units being a public benefit is accurate. However, that is not the only public benefit."
01_18_2018,affordable housing,"The mayor's commitment to finding affordable housing in the downtown core may have led him to support the eight soaring towers to provide more units of inclusionary housing. He may also be influenced by an attitude that is revealed in a recent [ORGANIZATION] article in which the mayor states, quote, downtown is the most logical [STREET] to grow or...  All of the growth we can accommodate there is growth that doesn't have to go into neighborhoods."" End quote."
01_18_2018,affordable housing,"We need more workforce housing. We need more affordable housing, lower income housing. There will be increased density because we already made that decision when we chose to locate within an urban growth boundary to preserve forest land  and farmland on the periphery."
01_18_2018,homelessness,"It's related to a crisis in homelessness. and a loss of demographic diversity, and we simply need more density. I want to advocate for the least restriction of building heights because we need to accommodate for the growth of the city, and we need more housing to meet the demand in order to contain costs."
01_18_2018,affordable housing,My testimony is related to [ORGANIZATION]. 4. I request that the current requirement to transfer FAR in order to build up to the allowable height be eliminated so that maximum density can be more readily reached without the added and unnecessary financial burden that transfer has on projects. The taller height limits in the central city allow for a lot of density and greater opportunities to provide more affordable housing units.
01_18_2018,affordable housing,"The additional 3-to-[ADDRESS] to prioritize affordable units. And in order to utilize that development in full, the building would need to be high-rise construction. The reality is high-rise construction adds a significant cost to a project and in and of itself often requires the maximum density in order for the project to financially make sense."
01_18_2018,affordable housing,"Every cost added to a project impacts the viability of that project. Allowing property owners to build up to the maximum height without the extra cost burden of an FAR transfer after they have met the affordable housing requirement will improve the chances that a larger project will be built, therefore increasing the opportunities for more affordable living units within the central city and larger public benefits that come with the increased housing from [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] fees to property taxes. For those reasons, I urge you to adopt [ORGANIZATION] to remove the transfer requirement for building up to the allowed height."
01_18_2018,affordable housing,"Good [TIME], Commissioners, Mayor. My name is [ORGANIZATION], resident of [ORGANIZATION], also a business owner, [ORGANIZATION]. We specialize in developing workforce and affordable housing as well as college housing in the central city."
01_18_2018,affordable housing,"I just want to put out there that what we've been talking about is expanding the government's ability, [ORGANIZATION] ability to provide additional FAR through the transfer program. And that could have multiple benefits, including potentially choosing affordable housing projects to sell to at discount rates. So that's what we're looking at."
01_18_2018,affordable housing,"I am also speaking [ORGANIZATION] in support of the [ORGANIZATION] amendment, which addresses amendment number four, In essence, this amendment would allow for the building of additional market rate and affordable housing when projects meet the 3 to 1 FAR bonus requirements while staying within property heighten limits. Again, the three-to-one bonus requirements are affordable housing requirements and seismic life safety requirements."
01_18_2018,affordable housing,"Importantly, employing this allowance for central city buildings that are already subject to design review would provide additional needed housing without compromising urban form. And considering the dire need for additional private funds to build our housing infrastructure, any policy that is accretive to our housing supply without compromising design quality is needed and consistent with the city's goals. This amendment would directly affect one project currently in our pipeline and certainly future projects, adding to the [ORGANIZATION]'s supply of affordable housing without additional tax burden, and in fact would provide additional property tax revenue."
01_18_2018,affordable housing,"In addition, I'd like to request reconsideration of [ORGANIZATION], referenced as CC-SW17 in [LOCATION]. As a building owner and resident of [ORGANIZATION], I certainly value the views of our beautiful scenic resources and quietly lament when they are blocked by construction around my home and my own office. However, I value transit-oriented affordable housing and jobs more than views, especially for views that are only available [ORGANIZATION] out of [DATE]."
01_18_2018,affordable housing,"Taking a position for the luxury of scenic views over housing or jobs is inconsistent with our city's goals, especially in a time when affordable housing is so scarce. Thank you. Thank you."
01_18_2018,affordable housing,"It worked like a charm, and [ORGANIZATION] has confirmed this during DATE0 DATE1 with many monitoring projects. In [DATE], under Commissioner [PERSON]'s leadership, [ORGANIZATION] helped install an eco-roof on FAC0 for stormwater research purposes. This was the first commercial eco-roof in [ORGANIZATION], and it was on an affordable housing building."
01_18_2018,affordable housing,"500 units of affordable housing were lost downtown when FAC0 were converted from affordable housing to condominiums. If you're one of the people living in those towers and you're complaining about the loss of your view from the new FAC1, I happily welcome the new 500 units of affordable housing that would replace what you made us lose. Sorry."
01_18_2018,affordable housing,"I am here to speak concerning the same two amendments. Let me say by [STREET] of preface on another subject, on the subject of affordable housing, my condominium is less affordable than ever, and it's due entirely to property taxes, which rose 19% DATE0. So it does seem to me that affordable housing initiatives and inexorably rising property taxes are at cross purposes."
01_18_2018,housing crisis,Nor was the city nor the owner of this property faced with the kind of issues that we face [ORGANIZATION] to resolve the housing crisis. So a height of 160 feet forces a building that will be built to the property lines in a muscular form. And the reason for that is because we have a base FAR of 9 to 1 and a bonus opportunity of 3 to 1 because of inclusionary zoning.
01_18_2018,affordable housing,"So when housing gets built in this city, there will automatically be the requirement for affordability. Okay. So every development that happens, yes, developers certainly make money, but there will also be affordable housing workforce and lower-income housing that results."
01_18_2018,housing crisis,"But I also understand that we are in a housing crisis in this city that's going to continue into the foreseeable future. So the question is, how do we trade these off? How do we weigh them?"
01_18_2018,affordable housing,"The correct context for consideration of this parcel is the 190 units that are the FAC0 condominiums directly to the north. Additionally, I want to just point –  point out something about the characterization of this amendment as enabling affordable housing. While correct, I think it's an incomplete characterization because it doesn't take into consideration the existing rental housing that's on the site."
01_18_2018,affordable housing,"There's 250 or I don't know the number, but...  that range of housing that's there now. And although it's not affordable housing, I think it's a fair assumption that the new housing, the incomes of the people who live in the new housing, even with the affordable component, will be [STREET] in excess of what's there now, the incomes of the people who live there now. So isn't this kind of the middle, missing middle, that is going to be removed?"
01_18_2018,affordable housing,"Good [TIME], Mayor [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] here representing [PERSON] and testifying related to Volume 2A, Part 1, Amendment 4, and in support of removing the FAR transfer requirement. A half-block site at Southwest Stark and FAC0, which is currently a surface lot, provides a really good example to illustrate our request. The base FAR plus the three-to-one affordable housing bonus and a 250-foot base height could result in a 25-story tower, but that's not likely to happen."
01_18_2018,affordable housing,"This taller project compared to the shorter seven-story one would give the city 128 more affordable housing units.  plus $8 million more in SDCs, $1.8 million more in CETs, $2.6 million [DATE] in property taxes on this site alone. By eliminating this one unneeded step, the city gains so much more in public benefits. It's a simple amendment that delivers bold results."
01_18_2018,affordable housing,"report, which we are in support of, and request that the council move forward and adopt in its current form. We believe that it is a good amendment because it meets the cities' and councils' objectives in relations to allowing full development of the site to the [ORGANIZATION] density, so increasing density that's allowed in the central city, which furthers the county's goals. affordable housing as well as job creation related goals which has been discussed here a number of times DATE0."
01_08_2015,affordable housing,"Under affordable housing, on page three, you requested that inclusionary zoning be elevated to a top city priority. And also included is support for the use of state bonds to fund affordable housing as proposed in the governor's recommended budget. Next, at Commissioner [PERSON]'s request, the Children's District Initiative has been removed."
02_09_2017,affordable housing,"well i think it we don't we don't really have a formal i'm careful not to use terms like affordable housing and stuff because it has connotations that mean very specific things to people i want to use a term that simply means that we look at the large spectrum of housing needs in [ORGANIZATION] not the top tier but kind of the middle income okay we try to fit in that giving a firm example we're planning on putting 76 units in this apartment  and they're going to be right around 1,000, some units below that, some above that."
02_09_2017,affordable housing,We have a lot of affordable housing data. I'm not sure why no one's mining. I've mined it.
02_05_2015,affordable housing,"When we have too few affordable housing units and [LOCATION], the solution is to lower the goal rather than increase the number of units. When the [ORGANIZATION] reports in the terrorism task force are inadequate, don't demand more information, just get rid of the reports. We've always said that if there's a real threat to public safety that's not manufactured by the [ORGANIZATION], the police obviously should work with the [ORGANIZATION] to investigate and prevent harm, but there's no real mechanism to ensure that's the only situation that will work together."
01_31_2018,homelessness,"88, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding help for businesses in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood with vandalism, mental health resources and homelessness. And 89, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding the impact rising crime and vandalism has on businesses, employees, clients, and community in [LOCATION]. Very good."
01_31_2018,housing crisis; affordable housing,"Three, more public campaigns and education about the availability of social services and programs like [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and ORG2.  Four, funding and approval of new programs like [ORGANIZATION], which seeks to mitigate drug-related issues by providing a supervised facility for users to use in private, giving users access to immediate treatment options as a humane alternative to incarceration or overdose. Five, more direct access to addiction and mental health services, not restricted only to PPD referrals. Six, addressing the housing crisis with taxation of corporations and the wealthy to provide more emergency shelters, supportive transitional housing, and subsidized affordable housing."
01_31_2018,homeless,"We have increased funding for trash collection, biohazard collection, and other issues. We have worked with private sector and nonprofit partners to help encourage volunteers to participate both supporting the homeless population and addressing some of the livability issues that come with it. So what I'm asking us all to do is let's put our collective energy, no matter where we..."
01_31_2018,homeless,"I look forward to working with you and your staff, [ORGANIZATION] to implement the innovative foster area shelters  steering committee. I think this will be a great new resource to help bring the neighborhood and the shelter provider as well as other interested parties together and make this as successful as possible in our district. But we're here to talk about [ORGANIZATION]."
01_31_2018,affordable housing,"We always strive to achieve our primary goal of providing affordable housing to the [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] community. As part of that, it's very important for us to always remain connected with the community and with our residents. As the Mayor explained, [ORGANIZATION] has been a valued member of the [ORGANIZATION] community for [ORGANIZATION]."
01_31_2018,homeless,"I'm a watchdog of [ORGANIZATION] on expanding your life expectancy, the [ORGANIZATION]. And if you begin to really understand...  providing the proper housing to people that are currently homeless, you can also be providing them additional [ORGANIZATION] of their life and you have to start calculating this out on the research that is being done from such as [ORGANIZATION] at [ORGANIZATION] on what you can actually do for the homeless communities on expanding their life as far as adding more [ORGANIZATION] from housing to health  to safety and understand that when the communities or the commissioners or anyone thinks that people living out on the streets is going to add more [ORGANIZATION] to their life, you have to start understanding that it is traumatic to them, it is stressful to them, it is unsafe to them, it is unhealthy to them. It is not having a concern for them if you think living outdoors is good for them and the longevity of their lives."
01_31_2018,affordable housing,They manage our public housing and our affordable housing targeted to the neediest in our community. We cannot do it if the federal government keeps scaling back. Can't maintain our assets.
01_31_2018,houseless,"It is made up mainly of professionals, and I am particularly concerned about the houseless community. In my many contacts with that community, I have found they are particularly treated poorly by the [ORGANIZATION] police. They're subject to sweeps, they have their belongings confiscated, and they are frequently stopped and asked to produce their ID."
01_31_2018,houseless,"Ms. [PERSON] noted that there are no houseless people being chosen. This analysis is coming to you from a group that's attended every [ORGANIZATION] meeting since its inception. It's a lot more than the members, as you heard, of the selection committee have done."
01_31_2018,housing crisis,"And whereas the housing crisis and politics of gentrification black veterans and families faced after the [LOCATION] floods is still very much felt in [ORGANIZATION]. And whereas we recognize the contributions of black community organizations, non-profit organizations, and advocates who continue to uplift the black community in [ORGANIZATION] and call for racial justice and an end to economic and social inequities. Now, therefore, I, [ORGANIZATION], Mayor of the City of [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION], do hereby proclaim [ORGANIZATION], to be [LOCATION] in [ORGANIZATION] and encourage all residents to observe DATE2."
01_02_2019,homeless,"And I think that, you know, [ORGANIZATION] is a perfect example of that. She has been instrumental in signing bills to kill off the homeless, like greenlighting the [ORGANIZATION] sweeping of homeless camps, the removal of our – yeah,"
01_02_2019,homeless,"you did, you voted, and it was in a unanimous vote. You voted on that, right?  Wasn't it yes vote? And the removal of homeless so-called zombie RVs, which are killing lots of older disabled homeless people."
01_02_2019,houseless,"And I want us to be careful that we have some kind of criteria for who's on it. I don't want just to have...  since we have so many percentage of people being a certain [STREET], that we have someone who's a token who is not representing the needs, and that just because someone is houseless doesn't mean they don't have really strong, legitimate contributions and legitimacy that we need to hear from. Hear, hear."
02_01_2017,houseless,You can... Hands up for houseless! Hands up for houseless! [PERSON] is life!
02_01_2017,houseless,"What is your job? I mean, this is not necessary. We're trying to fight for the houseless community."
02_01_2017,houseless,He has just as much control over this being as peaceful as you guys say you want it to be. And these guys advancing on women half their size and getting in people's faces when we're just trying to fight for the houseless is not peaceful. It's not.
02_01_2017,houseless,"My concern about this is kind of along the lines of [ORGANIZATION] here, but it also concerns the houseless that are going to fall through the cracks during this talks of annexation. And since there is no...  True municipal government to you know cover this boundary there are several families several individuals that are falling through the cracks because of that as well and this just goes further to show that [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] are have no sustainable plan to combat this issue. So I'm thinking that if this is going to be a real discussion, that I would like to challenge the city council and that of [PERSON] as well to make sure that they hold that up as a priority during those discussions because those people matter, because houseless lives matter."
02_01_2017,houseless,"We have to do it forever. So it's going to be snowing [ORGANIZATION], and we have houseless out there, and emerging this city to open more warming shelters. It's not going to be snowing."
02_01_2017,houseless,"Thank you. If they're going to go ahead with this question.  lease on FAC0, one thing I will say is that that is prime location to extend some outreach to the houseless community around there. If they're going to do that with such an expensive lease, I challenge them to open up a portion of their space for warming facilities, potential shower facilities for the houseless.  and other uses in that regard."
02_01_2017,houseless,"Or possibly we could, instead of investing more millions and millions of dollars into  yet more leases and spaces and buildings and whatnot, why don't we just take that money and give it directly to the houseless community and actually do some real outreach there, especially since we have no sustainable programs in that regard as of yet, and it is, again, about to snow and people probably will die from exposure. Oh, for the record, I'm star [ORGANIZATION] staffer. Thank you very much."
02_01_2017,affordable housing,"I would just like to clarify for the few people that are left here that [ORGANIZATION] is largely self-funding. We have 50 vacant positions that we are struggling to fill right now, and we're just slowing down our process of approving permits, including permits on affordable housing. We can't take money from [ORGANIZATION] and put it into another bureau as far as I know."
02_01_2017,affordable housing,"but we're not just doing it we also have a lot of tax increment resources being devoted to housing that we support the development of affordable housing through more traditional means so the housing thing isn't so much what we own but we know that we have a big need and we know the city is going to be asked to support  adding resources to meet that need, whether we're the owner or we're contributing that in the form of grant funds to developers that are building affordable housing on our behalf. So that's why I added that into that particular category, because that's an expanding piece of infrastructure for the city."
02_20_2019,unhoused,"Thank you. In a [STREET], you know, this is the kind of disruption that I think is tearing apart our ability to engage civilly with each other. And what we would like to hear from city council is what are some ways that we can ensure that the unhoused people who live in our neighborhood are  are not harassed and neither are the people who live in the building and feel harassed by the noise issues outside."
02_20_2019,homelessness,"Good morning.  for the record, and the fresh person clerk, [ORGANIZATION], as the former state treasurer had to sometimes also listen to in [ORGANIZATION]. I want to thank Commissioner [PERSON] for her question because it's, I think, illuminating for us as citizens, even those of us that engaged for [ORGANIZATION] with the city government, that if we want $50,000 to help with homelessness, we might have to have an agenda item. But the [STREET] that SDCs are structured...  is we have $2 million of slushy money, so we might be able to access $2 million of slush money for a traffic light, or maybe there's $4 million of slush money for a roundabout."
02_20_2019,homeless,"it's our feeling that this should also belong to the city sadly there's been also some other homeless folks that had gone out onto this area in [ORGANIZATION] and we were unable to shoo them out of there until just recently so there's a significant clean up that needs to be done to clean up the  the aftermath of that homeless camp. We're going to be cleaning that up as a, and it's a condition of the city, but we want to make sure it gets cleaned up too. So, and that work is going to start on [LOCATION]."
02_20_2019,homelessness,"The other thing that is evident from the testimony we've just had is that when the city does not mobilize adequate financial resources against homelessness...  ancillary costs everywhere. It sounds like the current property owner is in a financial situation where they're gracious and capable enough to mediate some of the problems that arise when some of us are forced to live outside, especially dealing with depression. How far is this [STREET] from a dumpster?"
02_20_2019,affordable housing,"The full repeal would solidify about 7,000 housing units, affordable housing units. It would give us a reprieve for that element. It would also give our committee, which is going to be formed  chance to breathe right now an DATE0 Delay to the inevitable which says This is a [ORGANIZATION] if you say that if you force the people to say that about their building They can't verify it any better than ORG1 can verify the list is is unverified if there's DATE1 arms in [ORGANIZATION], which I just heard and  A lot of those are actually in residential areas."
01_28_2015,affordable housing,"During DATE0, the [ORGANIZATION] has six projects to review. They are ORG1, ORG2, [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION], RISC,  procurement solicitation system, and the lien accounting system rewrite. Following my report on each project, Chief Technology Officer PERSON0 may provide any updates he feels is necessary."
01_28_2015,affordable housing,"Thank you, [ORGANIZATION]. The next project is the affordable housing software project. [ORGANIZATION] has contracted with [ORGANIZATION], ORG2, to implement a solution that will provide a single data repository for the city's affordable housing programs."
01_28_2015,affordable housing,"The only concern I have on this is you've stated it's very complex, there's going to be some delays, and I understand that. But my main concern on this is pertaining to the affordable housing software. One of the things I have done some speeches on in the past is to make sure that these loans are serviced properly."
01_28_2015,affordable housing,And that's my main concern on this whole issue pertaining to the affordable housing software. Thank you. Thank you.
01_28_2015,affordable housing,"I'm PERSON0, a [ORGANIZATION] resident of [ORGANIZATION]. We talked a little bit about affordable housing. Well, I live in affordable housing."
01_28_2015,affordable housing,"And my question is, if you're going to –  put people in affordable housing, then it would be a good idea to have some kind of a noise control ordinance around the affordable housing. Because right now, we don't. And I had a friend die because he was on a medication and wasn't getting sleep."
01_28_2015,affordable housing,"Unless it happens to you, you probably don't take it into consideration. But anyway... So the only option that a person has when they live in affordable housing, okay, since there is no noise control officer anymore that deals with those issues, that they have to call the police."
01_28_2015,affordable housing,"Question for you is, where does housing fit in the planning process, particularly around  capturing opportunities that are going to come through some decision making in this planning process. So we're going to have chances to think about where we put affordable housing or family-friendly housing or perhaps steer some city investments and other things. Could you give me, as one of the two champions for housing at [ORGANIZATION], how are we doing in that regard?  Commissioner, I can't give you specifics about current proposals or strategies that have been developed in conjunction with [ORGANIZATION], with ORG2, for example."
01_28_2015,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] may be able to shed more light on that, but I can tell you that that's a rising consideration in all our high-capacity transit corridor work. The steering committee of [ORGANIZATION], a bus rapid transit proposal that we're working with [ORGANIZATION], the city, and [ORGANIZATION] to proceed on, another steering committee which [PERSON] serves on, has seen remarkable development of strategies to avoid displacement, which is one objective behind investment in affordable housing. The encouragement of...  economically balanced communities in and around the transit station areas will be another incentive and motivation, I hope, for city and non-profit investment in the station areas of this corridor."
01_28_2015,housing crisis,"But this resolution is focused on how do we take care of city-owned assets that you, the citizens, owned. And so we certainly need to be looking at the other 50% for how are we going to help with the housing crisis. But this is about let's be disciplined in putting the money where we know the greatest infrastructure needs are."
01_28_2015,affordable housing,"DATE0, Mayor [PERSON] took a bold step to increase affordable housing  and to address displacement in north and northeast [ORGANIZATION] by allocating an additional $20 million in funds for housing in the interstate urban renewal area. The [ORGANIZATION] Housing Bureau was tasked with reaching out to the community to create a strategy for this additional investment. And this strategy that you'll hear [LOCATION] is the culmination of DATE2 of work by [ORGANIZATION] and community partners."
01_28_2015,affordable housing,and yet the amounts do not go far enough to address long-term housing stability. What other funds can be leveraged with this small amount of $20 million? Are there funds in the affordable housing set-aside?
01_28_2015,affordable housing,"What other funding streams are available from the city, from federal funds? How will these funds and others address and benefit long-term stabilization, homeownership, low-income affordable housing? Realizing that this $20 million is a budgetary shift of funds from [ORGANIZATION] to ORG1 and that there is no expected or forecasted any increase in the urban renewal area budget, are there other funds that should be included in this discussion and [ORGANIZATION]?"
01_28_2015,housing crisis,"And the purpose was to bring the benefit to the residents, not just redevelop sticks and bricks. an area that was segregated, redlined, disinvested in, and whose people's equity was stripped through the housing crisis. However, over [ORGANIZATION], our people have not been able to take advantage of the renewed investment."
01_28_2015,affordable housing,"Therefore, housing choice was not the thing that moved our people around the city, desegregating this area. The affordable housing dollars that are made available through the city is 30% set aside from tax increment financing. We'd like to know what amount has been captured to date."
01_28_2015,affordable housing,"First is to assist first-time homebuyers. $2.4 million would allow us to move an additional 40 households into homeownership, and an additional $2.6 million to develop new affordable housing homeowner stock in the area. Okay."
01_28_2015,affordable housing,"To be determined. Land that would be for affordable housing development guided by the community. Maybe mixed use land?  Mixed use, certainly, always when it's on the main arterial streets, which of course most of the urban renewal area is."
01_28_2015,affordable housing,"And much of what you've just heard is, in fact, not that different. These recommended investments expand a number of our existing effective programs to fund affordable housing development. So the strategy also includes several new practices and policies that will impact how we do our work.  shaped by the stories people have shared."
01_28_2015,affordable housing,"With the $20 million affordable housing initiative in north-northeast [ORGANIZATION] earmarked for helping prevent additional displacement of longtime residents and address a long history of institutional racism in the interstate corridor urban renewal area, now is the time to set aside money to be used solely for the purpose of increasing homeownership, particularly in the area of housing.  particularly among African-American families with moderate incomes, between 81% to 120% MFI. Rents are rising at astounding rates, and oftentimes a mortgage payment will be less than what a family pays for rent. Plus, a mortgage payment provides tax benefits that renting does not."
01_28_2015,affordable housing,"Thank you, [ORGANIZATION].  a good [TIME] mayor and commissioners for the record my name is [PERSON] i'm with [ORGANIZATION] and we're a statewide association of affordable housing and community development non-profits including 19 member organizations here in [ORGANIZATION] proud ground and habitat among them so [ORGANIZATION] on just wanted to chime in to add our strong support and thanks for this investment strategy we really appreciate the community outreach that went into developing the strategy and the city's efforts  to address the impacts of displacement and systemic racism  We're really pleased to see the variety of approaches in this plan, including the range of homeownership strategies, land banking, as well as the multifamily development. It's really important, as [ORGANIZATION] mentioned, to have that entire continuum. Like everyone else, we want to thank the Commissioner, the Mayor, PERSON3 and her staff, and the entire community for all the good work that went into this plan to invest in the desperately needed affordable housing and homeowner support in [LOCATION] and [LOCATION]east."
01_28_2015,affordable housing,"Our members are mission-driven nonprofits working in the community, and we all want to see the best and most effective use of this new investment in housing opportunity. And then finally, just to step back to the larger picture citywide, we believe and we hope you do as well that the city's affordable housing portfolio is an important public asset and part of our public infrastructure. We recognize that unlike our parks and roads, the [ORGANIZATION] portfolio is not wholly owned by the city, but the portfolio does represent a significant public investment in and a vital commitment to our collective goal of ensuring that all Portlanders –  of all income levels have a [STREET] to call home."
01_28_2015,homeless,"And we lived in [ORGANIZATION]. And in [ORGANIZATION], I've seen a big change in [ORGANIZATION] on this side, [ORGANIZATION] downtown, all the [STREET] east side. And what I've seen is I've seen a remarkably increase in the amount of people that are homeless."
01_28_2015,homeless,"For the nation, there's more than 33 percent emergency housing population. In [ORGANIZATION], there's less than 10%, and I believe that that's the correct amount. We need to do something to help the homeless population."
01_28_2015,homeless,"In [ORGANIZATION], and [ORGANIZATION] also, her family over [LOCATION] has also had homeless people with them. I also, my own home, my homes have had homeless people. Over [ORGANIZATION], I've had five, five people that are homeless."
01_28_2015,affordable housing,"you're still welcome council my name is [ORGANIZATION]  [ORGANIZATION], both Mayor [PERSON] and Chair PERSON2 cringed when I again raised the issue of [ORGANIZATION]'s vacant affordable housing five-apartment complex at [ADDRESS]. Unfortunately, body language isn't enough to change this situation and the organized crime I've been exposed to and have exposed. On a recent trip to FAC0, I saw [PERSON] ORG1 Deputy PERSON3, who testified on [LOCATION]."
01_28_2015,affordable housing,"I'm not one to accept my experience in the current vacant status of the entire complex named FAC0 as being what [ORGANIZATION] claims through its motto, meeting the affordable housing needs of the community. I don't believe the community accepts it either. Continuing, here's an email I sent to Ms. [PERSON]."
01_28_2015,affordable housing,"The attached materials serve to exemplify why we have people sleeping in doorways in [ORGANIZATION] while affordable housing is vacant. [ORGANIZATION] destroyed over $20,000 of my goods in two episodes in [ORGANIZATION] as I was appealing a so-called DATE1 no-cause eviction. I came home from work and found I'd been locked out of the apartment by [ORGANIZATION] in violation of a state-pending appeal, as determined by [ORGANIZATION]."
01_28_2015,affordable housing,"okay [ORGANIZATION] members it is an honor to sit before you DATE0 my name is [ORGANIZATION] and i live in [ORGANIZATION] the historically black neighborhood where people of color and families of color are disproportionately impacted by the massive loss of affordable housing i am part of the unpaid all-volunteer grassroots group ORG1 our concern is the destruction of sound livable and affordable housing to be replaced with a single house that is two to three times as much in price in price as the original  Normal people attempting to buy a home cannot compete with developers who often buy before the house was ever listed or outbid regular families looking to buy and pay cash. Generally speaking, if there is room for two houses after demolition, there was room for two houses before, whether next to the existing house or behind it while sharing the driveway as an easement."
01_28_2015,affordable housing,"A much better [STREET] would be to find a means to stem the tide of needless demolitions of affordable housing in our inner neighborhoods. Just here in [ORGANIZATION], the cities of [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] have found a [STREET] to stop the destruction of affordable houses, and we can follow their lead. We have an under-discussed means in [STREET] to vastly increase our affordable rental housing, and that is accessory dwelling units, or ADUs."
01_28_2015,affordable housing,"We are already charging no system development fees until [ORGANIZATION] for ADUs. That lowers the total cost around 10%. Promoting ADUs would help lower income homeowners pay their mortgages, keep them from losing their homes, and massively increase density in those inner neighborhoods that are most afflicted by destruction of affordable housing."
01_28_2015,affordable housing,"PERSON0. Well, I'd like to thank Mayor [PERSON] for his commitment to addressing displacement and for backing up that commitment with some tangible resources to bring more affordable housing to north and northeast [ORGANIZATION]. I want to thank all of our panelists [ORGANIZATION] for taking time out of [LOCATION] to come here and share their ideas about the solutions we're proposing and also advocating for additional solutions and for being willing to assist us in developing policies to help us to begin to turn the tide on this table."
01_27_2016,homeless,"And what's incredible about this is it shows, tells the story of heroes, advocates in our community. So whether you're white, you're homeless, you're LGBTQ, whether you're Muslim or you're black, whether you're an Asian Pacific Islander, it tells these stories. And these kids were like, wow."
01_27_2016,homeless,"I don't think fountains turned off is going to work that well for homeless housing, but I hope that you'll be able to fund this program. Thank you. Thank you."
01_27_2016,affordable housing,"First of all, that after [ORGANIZATION] of underfunding, many of [ORGANIZATION]'s roads, sidewalks, bike  had fallen into disrepair, adding up to an incredibly expensive and still increasing maintenance backlog. Deferring maintenance [ORGANIZATION] increases the cost of repair exponentially, as you've heard already. It forces future city councils to choose between crumbling roads and vital services like affordable housing and public safety."
01_18_2017,homeless,"That was obviously extremely helpful. I want to acknowledge our colleagues on the other side of the river, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and [ORGANIZATION] have just done a fantastic job. All the volunteers who took shifts at the [ORGANIZATION] building, the [PERSON] building, or other shelters across the city, and all [ORGANIZATION]ers, and this one is probably the most important, just ordinary [ORGANIZATION]ers who took the time to check on their neighbors, to ask the people they found on the streets if they were doing all right, and making sure that they got the help they needed."
01_18_2017,homeless,"And this right here caused the violence Not just allowing people to sleep there [ORGANIZATION] a breakthrough international study Was published on violence between chimpanzees  The reasons the study was such a big deal is that the parallel to human nature is clear. Chimpanzees are the only other hominin known to commit homicide besides us. In homeless crowds, this proves true."
01_18_2017,homeless,"In homeless crowds, this proves true. Fundamentally, there's nothing wrong with allowing a large body of people to congregate. It's just that if you take away their freedom and you make them fight for a [STREET] to sleep, then they just might do so."
01_18_2017,homeless,"Next item, [DATE], request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding affordable micro-housing and homeless villages. Good morning. Good morning, sir."
01_18_2017,affordable housing,"So hopefully with this bond that went through, we should be able to build a couple micro-communities and supply them for affordable housing. And then we have sort of, I guess you'd call them intentional communities  as part of the tiny house movement because most of the intentional communities do have a factor of tiny house living in them. It could be co-homes."
01_18_2017,homeless,"So you could have an intentional community that could be built specifically for seniors, for people that are disabled, and we're actually doing that around the country. We probably should catch up a little bit. And then another part of the tiny house movement has to do with tiny houses for the homeless, and that is also catching on big time."
01_18_2017,homeless,"not just here in [ORGANIZATION], but throughout the country. We go throughout the country and speak on the benefits of all these tiny house parts of the tiny house movement, but what's catching on quick are the tiny houses for the homeless because it's a much less expensive [STREET] to get folks in. Example, FAC0, even though I do love the building, I love the concept, it was great, but if we look at the cost, $2,500 per tiny house is what the last mayor paid [ORGANIZATION] to build these tiny houses."
01_18_2017,homeless,"$2,500 as compared to $250,000, let's say, for a studio,  that's [ADDRESS]. So we really need to look at the tiny house movement in all of its glory, not just ADUs, not just tiny houses on wheels, which we should add to this new zoning proposal to make them legal, to say, hey, we could consider this an ADU, if it has skirting, if you take it off the wheels, whatever we need to do to make them legal here in [ORGANIZATION]. Also, finally...  I am a little concerned about the tiny house movement for the homeless, only because not just things have gone awry or off track, but  But we could do a lot better job by saying, listen, you have a certain amount of time to be there."
01_18_2017,homeless,"You have to work with your neighbor association, get neighbor policies. So even though the new one going in in [ORGANIZATION] is beautiful, we need a citywide policy for all of the tiny house communities for the homeless so that we have some consistency. And that's about it."
01_18_2017,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], can I just make one observation? Sure. Thank you for your work, not only in micro-housing, but in flagging innovative ways to bring the cost down of affordable housing."
01_18_2017,affordable housing,"Those are two vitally important things. The one thing, though, that I'm going to just gently push back is when we invest in affordable housing with services –  We build apartments, and then we have meeting spaces, and we have on-site health care clinics, and we have other things. So if we divide the units by the total cost of the building, we have a very misleading number of the cost per unit."
01_18_2017,homeless,"I want them to say good and bad, and they should have the right to do that, still receive the grant, and not feel as though in the future they won't continue to receive the grant for their good work that they do in the community, which I agree they do, and also working with the homeless, providing them additional sources of income and resources.  and work, which I think is very beneficial. I just wanted to make it very clear, sometimes when grants are given, there are statements in these grants that want good PR to the city, and when we're dealing with a publication here, I want that to be removed. I want them to have the right to say, I may not like what this commissioner is doing, and I'm going to put it in my publication."
01_18_2017,homeless,"But I do believe that [STREET] routes should function by itself. There's no need to give it any money or any grants for anything  I agree with Commissioner [PERSON] that if you really are homeless, you should go to FAC0 or [ORGANIZATION] and be with other homeless people and figure out what to do. My opinion that [STREET] roots is more poetry, and it doesn't need any money from the city."
01_18_2017,homeless,"And I don't like the idea that somehow [STREET] roots is some –  [STREET] to get valuable information to homeless people, that is not a good argument. So I don't know why the public sector is involved with the thing. Good morning, Commissioners."
01_18_2017,homeless,"So in addition to approving this grant with [ORGANIZATION], I hope that there will be money, as you work with the county on [ORGANIZATION],  to track the ability of people that want to at [STREET] routes, connect with vocational rehab, move into ORG2 and other full-time independent granting work. Not a pressure system where people are afraid to affiliate with [STREET] routes because they're going to be drug into a system they don't want to participate in, but so that people are doing [STREET] routes, have enhanced connectivity with the state VR system, with ORG2,  If they're eligible and comfortable with ORG2 or [PERSON], then that should be open to them. But there are no one-size-fits-all solutions."
01_18_2017,homelessness,"Studies have shown that people are surprisingly not swayed by their position. Their thinking is not swayed by what the media reports, but...  What they give thought to has been shown to be swayed by what media report. And so when it comes to homelessness, you can see how this could be a problem."
01_18_2017,homelessness,"that was released and some concerns we have with the community and i think it is now a better more democratic process i enthusiastically support this particular appropriation and just a couple pieces of context  We have a proud tradition, as Commissioner [PERSON] alludes to, of supporting organizations like [ORGANIZATION]. In fact, one of the cornerstones of our collective efforts to address homelessness is that we fund [ORGANIZATION], which is a publication of [ORGANIZATION] and something dates back, I think, to ORG2, and we are very proud of that relationship."
01_18_2017,homelessness,"Thank you. Also, I think something that's lost in this is if you look at the impact statement, we're reminded that [ORGANIZATION] is at its core a nonprofit that helps people experiencing homelessness, many of whom are experiencing poverty, mental and physical disabilities, create opportunity for themselves, which is why all of us buy [ORGANIZATION].  which is why during this storm a number of us bought more than one copy and sometimes actually paid more than the face value for three booths because we're supporting people in their desire to be self-sufficient. And finally, on the question of their editorial independence, I don't think either [ORGANIZATION] or [PERSON] or any of the award-winning reporters  have to worry about editorial independence."
01_18_2017,homelessness; affordable housing,"They take us to task on a regular basis on homelessness, affordable housing, super fund, equity, and I would hope that that proud tradition continues whether we fund them or not. Awesome. Hi. PERSON0?"
01_18_2017,homeless,Some people think that there needs to be a very strong head-butting and assertion against Governor [PERSON]'s failure to be more supportive of the people of [ORGANIZATION] and their desire not to have their water done in a deal with [ORGANIZATION] and unfortunately you're not state treasurer anymore so you can't get creative about ways that we can stimulate the economy in [ORGANIZATION] and have people living near clean public water and still have good paying jobs. But that's one of the things that [PERSON] constituents look for is for public leaders to engage around the most important issues and water is right up there with keeping our homeless people from dying when they can't get the mental health services they need or the basic shelter they need. Thank you.
01_18_2017,homeless,"It will be some of these folks have already relapsed three or four times, and this would be a different approach to take the care to their homes. And my other question is, will patients who are homeless and being not released to a home where you can visit them be served through this program somehow? I look to build on that in the future."
01_18_2017,homeless,"The more mobile homeless might pose challenges. Yeah. We have another program that we're kind of connecting high utilizers that [STREET], and those individuals are being sought out regardless."
01_18_2017,homeless,"I'm [PERSON], and I support these kind of things for the simple reason is if you have a fire and rescue basically has equipment that they don't use unless there's a fire, it just sits there and they don't use it. DATE0, [LOCATION], I had an experience where some homeless guy was begging for money outside of FAC0 on FAC1. And luckily, the [INSTITUTION] arrived about the same time the policeman or the county sheriff."
01_18_2017,houseless,"So that's going to be a very...  tricky issue with the number of houseless people we have here. And it's something that I, dealing with the houseless community, am going to have to tell them. Well, you might reduce your risk of death if you lie to your discharge person at the hospital and say that you live somewhere."
01_29_2020,homeless,DATE0 and of course the doctors aren't getting paid so I think they can figure out what injured and pissed off feels like. There's an absent chair here in the council chambers. As a child they used to play musical chairs with music and take a chair away and that's what they're doing to the homeless people and other people such as myself that have been injured and It never got any justice.
01_29_2020,houseless,But I bet the folks that help you will be houseless too. Thank you. Peace.
01_29_2020,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION], I know who you are, but could you state your name for the record, please? [ORGANIZATION] Portland, [ORGANIZATION]. Thank you very much."
01_29_2020,homeless,"We used to have a very large kind of Saudi Arabian [INSTITUTION] canopy-styled [ORGANIZATION] [INSTITUTION]. We don't have that anymore. There used to be a bunch of homeless people sleeping in front of it, but they got swept DATE0."
01_29_2020,homeless,"There's anti-homeless chain link fences more important than pedestrians. Elderly people taking their wheeled luggage back and forth from the [ORGANIZATION] station were like, screw y'all."
01_29_2020,homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, [PERSON], the [LOCATION], the [ORGANIZATION], and ORG6. I've provided maps for the property and what I would suggest to you is that we floated these properties kind of in a group because all six of these properties are challenged in one [STREET] or another. Two of the properties have ground tanks on them."
01_29_2020,houseless,"If we own these properties and there's really no rush in actually acquiring the money that the sale would have. You said you talked to the office, [ORGANIZATION], and they didn't see any opportunity to utilize these five pieces of land for folks who are suffering on our [STREET]? No."
01_29_2020,homelessness,"I have to trust the judgment of [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]. As I said, these properties are kind of awkward. And there are facilities."
01_29_2020,houseless,"And again, I'm just asking a question and would like to make sure that we're not giving away property that we could temporarily use to house our houseless folks. So thank you. Could I ask a follow-up on this question?"
01_29_2020,homeless,"You may be several steps ahead of me. Is there currently any centralized disposition process that would include [ORGANIZATION] or [PERSON]? The process that we went through, this all began [ORGANIZATION] when we were trying to sell a piece of property, and it turned into a huge kerfuffle."
01_29_2020,homelessness,"So there is a process, and I tried to be careful and mention for both Commissioner [PERSON]'s benefit and Commissioner [PERSON]'s benefit, that it includes talking to [ORGANIZATION] and to ORG1. And I can only... I can only trust that they know what they need and where they need it."
01_29_2020,affordable housing,"The city declared a housing state of emergency, and what that did was it removed some of the impediments to locating both shelter and affordable housing in the city of [ORGANIZATION]. So actually, as the state takes up their question of the housing emergency, they're actually looking at the code that we adopted [ORGANIZATION]. I mean, and I wish we could apply the same rules to federal, metro, and county-owned property as well, instead of returning property to the private market."
01_29_2020,homeless,"And then, you know, [ORGANIZATION] wouldn't have to be paying $40 for me to go through and screen on every, you know, [STREET] that isn't available because they're very mysterious about whether they have an apartment available or not. So, yeah, there are low risk homeless people that you could put on these properties. Thank you."
01_29_2020,homeless,"But the point is, I think the gentleman from [ORGANIZATION] has done all he can. One of the problems is that the extent of his procedure that he's been instructed in is to go to ORG1 and go to ORG2. In a different context, ORG2 is administered by an addict."
01_29_2020,homeless,[ORGANIZATION] is addicted to taking money and dumping it on transition projects after skimming off a little bit to staff [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON] and ORG2 were not envisioned or assisted. in their birth by [ORGANIZATION].
01_29_2020,homeless,"But the idea that these properties might be difficult to sell is all the more reason to consider that even if it's a short-term camp that doesn't have the duration of [ORGANIZATION] or, you know, [ORGANIZATION] was able to move. It seems like 1800 FAC0 is not very far from [ORGANIZATION], which we're trying to send out to [PERSON], where some people are saying, oh my gosh, homeless people might live next to the library that they spend their whole day in anyway."
01_29_2020,homeless,"And so for all these other crises, the homeless crisis, that is a real crisis. The climate crisis, that is a real crisis. The two crises that I'm even speaking about affect our community and affect how the city of [ORGANIZATION] is going to even operate and whether or not we're going to be able to sustain for [ORGANIZATION] to come."
01_29_2020,homeless,"When I say community partners, I'm talking about community partners that will help with the homeless crisis, community partners that will also help with our environmental crisis that we're currently in, and also have people that would be able to give bids for and estimates on what materials are going to need to bring these lands up to code. I think that has to happen before the next report. And I'm out of time."
01_29_2020,homeless,"I went to homeless shelters and I would walk up to people and go, you look like a leader. You should be in my program. Right."
01_29_2020,homelessness,"Even with those measures in [STREET], there are still members of our community who face barriers to participation, especially among communities of color, immigrant and refugee communities, youth, elders, and people experiencing homelessness. And I would be remiss if I didn't mention that [ORGANIZATION] does not have a proud history when it comes to the rights of African Americans. I want to acknowledge it's been [ORGANIZATION] since black people could live in [ORGANIZATION] by law, And it's been [ORGANIZATION] since black people were granted the right to vote, which is a story that often gets lost when we celebrate the past."
01_04_2017,affordable housing,"We have – yeah, please, Commissioner [PERSON]. No, this is – there's no presentation unless you have questions, but –  this is simply [ORGANIZATION] the council did authorize the first acquisition under the affordable housing bond measure the [ORGANIZATION] apartments and so this uh this item basically allows [ORGANIZATION] to assume all the miscellaneous contracts associated with that acquisition everything from landscaping services to well smoke detectors all those things all those services  PERSON1, the [ORGANIZATION] Director, is here if there are questions. So this is more in the nature of a housekeeping matter?"
01_04_2017,homeless,"We had some questions about when [ORGANIZATION] goes out and does contracts,  We're concerned about that. We're getting emails about the organization. Is it [PERSON] that runs most of the homeless under housing?"
01_04_2017,homeless,"I hate these initials. I really do because I get confused with all these initials. But the contractors that deal with the homeless people, if they're selling stuff, I want them in jail."
01_04_2017,homeless,"I was homeless for [ORGANIZATION], and I was taken in by the [ORGANIZATION], FAC0. I found it was a very resourceful [STREET]. You do bar reports for laundry money."
01_04_2017,homeless,"It's hard to look for a job if you don't take a shower or something or have clean laundry. If anybody walked into [ORGANIZATION] and said they were homeless and need help, I'd refer them to FAC0, and I have. And another resource is [ORGANIZATION].  is another [STREET]."
01_04_2017,homeless,"So if people are trying to do things, I'm just making a reference, like these apartments, people are trying to do something, and whether they're selling coats or something, they're just attempting to do something. And we're working forward in [ORGANIZATION], especially when FAC0 started. I spent DATE0 in the basement homeless."
02_15_2017,homeless; homelessness,"If you could bring 140 to the front of the regular agenda, please. Item 140, amend [ORGANIZATION] with [LOCATION] to support ongoing implementation of activities to prevent and end homelessness through partnership with the county and [ORGANIZATION] and increase funds by $2,558,474. Director [PERSON], good morning."
02_15_2017,homeless,"The [STREET] that we're structured is [ORGANIZATION] created DATE0 through intergovernmental agreements. So their entire budget from the city flows through ORG1, and we have an intergovernmental agreement that governs that flow of funds and the governance of ORG2. And [ORGANIZATION] administers that intergovernmental agreement, and she'll explain the reason for this resolution."
02_15_2017,homeless,"Good morning, Mayor and Commissioners. As [ORGANIZATION] mentioned, my name is [PERSON]. I'm with [ORGANIZATION] and also serve as the liaison of our bureau to [ORGANIZATION]."
02_15_2017,homeless,"I know [ORGANIZATION] [TIME] [ORGANIZATION] heard a great briefing from ORG1 on the progress that we've made  over [LOCATION] through very targeted and intentional efforts through a home for everyone. This ordinance that you have before you is an amendment to ORG1, ORG2, that further advances this work. It accommodates council funding from DATE2 fall bump, or [ORGANIZATION] fall bump, to provide expanded emergency services and shelter and housing placement activities that are already."
02_15_2017,homelessness,"Then, to follow that up, you get to read in the paper about other people discussing what to do with your life, about how shelters and overpriced units so small you can't even invite a friend over are a solution to homelessness rather than the underlying cause. There's experiences like these that make me want to show up to public meetings and say, hey, you're killing me. But then when I show up to these meetings, for example, [ORGANIZATION],  After listening to them kill [TIME] congratulating one another, they say, hey, could you please keep it to [TIME] because we're running out of time here."
02_15_2017,homeless,"Now we're – well, okay, I missed the funding opportunity to speak about that. But now we're discussing handing $3 million to an agency that has not involved homeless people in their decision-making process. Okay."
02_15_2017,homeless,"On the contrary, I tried showing up to a [ORGANIZATION] meeting [ORGANIZATION], and [PERSON] was blatantly turning homeless people away at the door. It was a public meeting about homeless people. This is not [ORGANIZATION]."
02_15_2017,homeless,"It's at the county, and they have a specific subcommittee that is made up of homeless men and women that have input into the plan. Well, I've been looking for meetings. I haven't found one."
02_15_2017,homelessness,"This is job security for them, not solutions for us. People are dying. You think shelters are a solution to homelessness?"
02_15_2017,homeless,"I invite you to try being homeless. And other bigger cities that have been there tried that. The problem, as I see it, begins with the founding fathers."
02_15_2017,homeless,"Not all homeless people agree with me. I can't speak for everybody, and that's the whole point. We need to involve, you know, talk to them, not just the select few who can manage to get emailed about this vague meeting somewhere."
02_15_2017,homeless,"and yet he got a good job later on and [ORGANIZATION] treated him quite well. And why don't you treat homeless people and try to make sure when they're cold and they have to use the bathroom. You know, if you use the bathroom in the bushes, it's indecency."
02_15_2017,homeless,"When you go into FAC0, there's a big sign in the front door that we treat people here like human beings, even if they do or don't make it in this city. And my father made it in this city, but he was homeless. Thank you, sir."
02_15_2017,homeless,"That will be posted online, so I do encourage you to review the...  presentation, and it was live at the time also, I believe. One of the things that stuck with me the most was in [ORGANIZATION], 6,[ADDRESS] is that 6,000 people became homeless."
02_15_2017,homelessness,We're fundamentally nonpartisan and have really no stake in what happens  kinds of stories we're telling around these themes. We're trying to break ground on important issues like housing and homelessness to try to understand how to better allocate resources and bring something new to the table that is sometimes beyond the scope of what government actually can afford to do because it's very expensive to run these data projects. And we have  all of these folks that are coming out from some of the best technical areas in [ORGANIZATION] working together on these super teams alongside teams with government.
02_15_2017,homelessness,"And it's not even about open data as an issue. It's about every other issue that data is a part of. And so if we can understand the [ORGANIZATION] budget better to apply toward things like emergency response and homelessness and housing, we think it benefits everybody."
02_15_2017,homeless; homelessness,"Thank you. This allocation of funds was a part of the discussion around funds associated with the [ORGANIZATION] planning effort, specifically looking at legal services for individuals that were homeless or at risk of homelessness. And in the partition of the responsibilities between the city, the joint office, and the county, renter protections stayed with the city."
02_15_2017,homeless,"It was also mentioned during our meeting [ORGANIZATION] talking about housing issues, that we have a number of organizations here like [ORGANIZATION] outside in [ORGANIZATION] and others that work with homeless youth, and they have their own set of job training programs. And we had quite a...  Interesting conversation about their results. I think they had something like 180 people participate in their program, 40 actually found employment."
02_15_2017,homeless,"And it just occurred to me as I was reading the [ORGANIZATION] to this and Commissioner [PERSON]'s comments that this is sort of center of target in some of those opportunities areas. If you're ever looking for a broadening of those opportunities, it might be interesting to go beyond the juvenile justice program and start looking at the homeless youth continuum as maybe another potential source. And we've been working with the county on this for [ORGANIZATION], I think."
02_15_2017,affordable housing,"Second. And number four, finally, and this one is not currently in the recommended draft that I'd like to introduce for consideration, I'd like to add a technical fix to Recap 8 that would implement the council's intent from [ORGANIZATION] related to inclusionary housing parking requirements. That is, waive parking requirements for projects that build affordable housing and require parking for those that pay a fee in lieu."
02_15_2017,affordable housing,"uh to be clear this is not a major change or a departure from current policy and the status quo because far and hide allowances remain the same and it's not the master stroke that's going to solve the city's housing deficit but it does allow for incremental progress towards some of the city's most challenging housing goals and it also has the additive benefit of not costing the city anything to implement  Finally, as demonstrated by the letters, which I believe were submitted to members of the council and have copies of those, if you haven't received those, this amendment has support from widespread support from both the affordable housing community and the market rate development community and really presents an opportunity to allow those communities to have another tool to try and  could bring more units online in the city."
02_12_2015,affordable housing,"And we are a group of housing advocates, affordable housing providers, and community members, educators, health care providers, labor folks interested and concerned about affordability in our community. And we are grateful for all the work that's gone forward to get us to [ORGANIZATION] with the ORG0 committee and everyone involved in this work. And we just want to put something on the table for your future consideration."
02_12_2015,affordable housing,"There are a group of cities that use an elevated fee structure to do a couple of things, to deter some demolitions from occurring when it's not in the community's best interest or it doesn't increase density or it doesn't increase density. Where it doesn't create new affordability But when demolitions do go forward a in the case of these cities $10,000 fee is collected and contributed to an affordable housing account and That affordable housing account then gets used to help mitigate the loss of some of that lost affordability through again some demolitions and I  It allows for first-time homeowners who aren't able to break into the market to have extra funds to purchase their first-time family home."
02_12_2015,affordable housing,"Number two, Mayor, on the question of what Commissioner [PERSON] is going to look at on potentially a fee for affordable housing and the other issues that you've identified, what's the time frame that you're going to set for something coming back to us? Yeah, I think it's – and some of these things are going to take longer than others. On the issue of hazardous materials, I think that one can be done pretty quickly, probably [ORGANIZATION]."
02_12_2015,affordable housing,"Simple delays, be they [ORGANIZATION] or [LOCATION], have been a feeble solution. Demolitions of up to 370 affordable houses a year valued at $100 million dwarfs the city's efforts at spending $20 million to support affordable housing. Can we really achieve affordable housing through demolition?"
02_12_2015,affordable housing,"And I just wanted to talk about a couple of things that you mentioned in your interview with [ORGANIZATION] that I think inform your decisions, not necessarily about both related to this ordinance, but also related to the other things that you were talking about. So, oops, you rejected two fallacies during that interview. First, that demolitions provide affordable housing, and second, that preservation undermines density."
02_12_2015,affordable housing,"I have some specific ideas as to how you can reduce demolitions while promoting density, affordable housing, and historic preservation. Okay. Obviously, we need to reduce incentives for demolition."
02_12_2015,affordable housing,We need to increase incentives for preservation. Some specific ideas are to combine historic preservation and affordable housing incentives. [ORGANIZATION] issued a [ORGANIZATION] report on credits and bonuses that is really helpful.
02_12_2015,affordable housing,"Okay, so these are some of the solutions that other cities employ. I point these out because I'm asking you to please not stop at the changes that are proposed [ORGANIZATION]. Fix the code and look creatively at bonuses and credits to provide affordable housing and density."
02_12_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I am concerned about our affordable housing crisis, specifically that when houses are demolished, the replacements cannot be as affordable. For the same reasons that the greenest building is the one already built, the most affordable home is also the one already built. Plus, when single-family homes are demolished, we can lose homeownership and therefore stability in our communities."
02_12_2015,affordable housing,"We lose stability also for our families, for current homeowners, families starting out, and in the equity and heritage that is passed down to future generations. We must disincentivize demolishing our single-family homes to curb and counter the market forces that destroy our affordable housing stock. But I am also concerned that our efforts to increase our supply are resulting in the demolition of our truly affordable homes."
02_12_2015,affordable housing,"One step forward, three steps back. The need for affordable housing cannot be met by policies and projects that encourage demolishing our existing low-cost homes. Without our fixer-uppers, the housing stock will be affordable only for those who are not disadvantaged or moved here from out of state."
02_12_2015,affordable housing,"Without the truly affordable housing, the homes that are already built, people are being displaced to places that will continue the problem that it was intended to solve. Pending legislation in [ORGANIZATION] includes increasing financing for affordable housing, directing cities and counties to ensure an adequate supply of affordable housing, and removing the ban on inclusionary zoning, thereby allowing municipalities to require developers to reserve a certain percentage of their units for low- or moderate-income families. All are good concepts and are for a good and necessary cause."
02_12_2015,affordable housing,"But if they pass without conditions that protect our existing homes from demolition, the consequences will be the opposite of their intentions. If the city does not work with the state to keep those incentives for creating affordable housing from being applied where existing housing stock would be destroyed, they will be but a pretense that we are dealing with the affordability crisis. [ORGANIZATION] strategy talks about helping people repair and maintain their homes this needs to be the focus for increasing affordability they are talking about locating new affordable housing in empty lots that should be the rule they talk about helping people add value to their property so they can afford to stay in their homes for example by adding accessory dwelling units we must be sure this is not just talk  that it becomes citywide and that we are using our influence to build it into state laws as well."
02_12_2015,affordable housing,"We must save our existing affordable housing from both private and public efforts. If we really are looking out for the disadvantaged lower-income citizens and our young families, we must make sure that we are looking forward to see who will benefit, the neighbor who no longer has a neighborhood or the opportunity to own their own home or the developer who is encouraged to make their money under the guise of sacrifice for the common good. We know that the city intends to do the right thing, but we're not sure that we are not committing the urban renewal mistake of [ORGANIZATION]."
02_12_2015,affordable housing,"Thank you, Mayor [PERSON], for your commitment to working on the infill standards and development process. As requested by 40 neighborhood associations, we call for the creation of a task force to make the comprehensive plans, policies 5.33 and 4.133. 4.13 for the production of affordable housing and neighborhood character a reality"
02_12_2015,affordable housing,"The issues associated with demolition regulation are many, from preservation of viable, affordable housing, protection of public health from demolition process, preservation of cultural and historic resources that are important to the character of our city, and not least, the common courtesy of informing neighbors of an impending demolition. These all need to be addressed, if not now, in the very near future. DATE0, I found online the [PERSON] 2455-200 rewrite on the agenda for [LOCATION], presuming that is the version under consideration."
02_12_2015,affordable housing,"A [ORGANIZATION] plan review can take [ORGANIZATION] and more with appeals and adjustment. A developer has little or nothing to gain from engaging in any kind of negotiation. I see the unintended consequences of making it easier to demolish viable, affordable housing without neighborhood assistance."
02_12_2015,affordable housing,"But I also believe that demos are another variable leading to the lack of affordable housing product in our city, which is, I think, approaching crisis level. Okay. i encourage you to explore ways to increase incentives for non-profit and for-profit developers to build homes that are affordable to low and middle-income families to buy the tax abatements and the sdcs are set there and are are great"
02_12_2015,affordable housing,"It's very challenging to figure out how to manage that. And I know that your staff in planning and sustainability are working hard on code language, the comprehensive plan, looking at design and those kinds of issues. In the meantime, we also need to look at affordable housing."
02_11_2015,homeless,They tend to be homeless and vagrants and folks who are doing other things in the park. The people who drop cigarette butts come from all walks of life. I see my neighbors who live in the buildings along the park blocks.  grinding them out and leaving them on the [STREET].
01_30_2019,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION], the first individual, please. Item 65, request of PERSON1 to address [ORGANIZATION] regarding homeless bill of rights. Good morning."
01_30_2019,homeless,"My name is [ORGANIZATION]. It's been a mantra of mine lately that homeless people should be a protected class. Now, such an assertion is pregnant with legal implications, and admittedly, part of its appeal to me is the favor it might find with the trial lawyer lobby that seems to steer the wheel of my party from time to time."
01_30_2019,homeless,"I realize, however, that statute rarely offers total solutions. To be sure, some rights, the right to vote and to representation, are endangered to the homeless. It also, however, occurs to me that part and parcel to liberty is the right to drop out, to go off the grid."
01_30_2019,homeless,[ORGANIZATION] would strip away the voices of undocumented citizens if it could. It would silence the voices of the homeless if it could. I implore this council not to be an accomplice to that crime.
01_30_2019,homeless,"Then lastly, just for the record, why are you not giving me your opinion to the question I presented back in [ORGANIZATION]? And I want to get off the subject just for [TIME] about the homeless. I don't see any of these people stepping up."
01_30_2019,homeless,"When my building got burnt down 77,000 square feet, one of the cars got broke into in my business [ORGANIZATION]. And then the homeless, we caught him stealing one of my vans, and he's being convicted of that. So there's a little bit of how we help the homeless help us."
01_30_2019,homeless,"Welcome. Thank you for letting me come in and speak, but I want to say hello, everyone. I was homeless, and we found a [STREET] to live."
01_30_2019,homeless,"It devastated me because we were homeless, and he was scamming everybody that was in that home. He took advantage of the homeless situation, and this is not right. So I would request and I would like to know if every recovery home, say recovery homes, to be audited."
01_30_2019,homeless,"to make sure that they have a license, that they are affiliated with some sort of [ORGANIZATION] or corrections or ORG1 or something like that, to make sure that they're legal. Because we became homeless again. And they had a 400-pound woman in a closet."
01_30_2019,affordable housing,"That was quickly followed by two more projects in [ORGANIZATION], one in [ORGANIZATION] and the other at FAC0, both containing affordable housing. Yeah. In [LOCATION], we added FAC1 and FAC1 South, and DATE2, we hope to add one to three more commercial new constructions."
01_30_2019,affordable housing,Expanding online permitting to project-managed projects will make the permitting process easier and faster for affordable housing projects that the city finances. and obviously we need to be doing everything we can to expedite these projects. So I'm glad to see [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] engaged in solving that problem.
01_30_2019,homeless; houseless,"So my question [ORGANIZATION] is, as we know, houseless youth of color and [ORGANIZATION] plus youth are disproportionately affected by houselessness in [ORGANIZATION]. In addition to the services we provide that are specific to the [ORGANIZATION] plus youth in the homeless youth continuum, what efforts are being made to provide culturally specific services for black youth and youth of color in the homeless youth continuum? Thank you."
01_30_2019,homeless,"I'll go ahead and take a first swing at that. First of all, just so we don't claim credit for other people's work, [ORGANIZATION] manages the homeless youth continuum, but obviously we're huge supporters of the overall homeless services network through [ORGANIZATION] between the city and the county. Of course, there are significant culturally specific issues.  service providers."
01_30_2019,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], who's sitting behind you, runs the housing services for the mayoral administration. We've been focusing on a couple of very specific projects, [ORGANIZATION], which includes what's called a preference policy designed to ensure that families who were impacted by previous development and gentrification  are at the top of the list in terms of being able to return to the community and take advantage of the affordable housing that's being created by the city of [ORGANIZATION]. And that is largely a community-driven process."
01_20_2016,homeless,"I do think that it would be better if we could more often talk about the hopefully positive revenue impacts, not necessarily through our local controls, but –  Hopefully, like [ORGANIZATION], the [ORGANIZATION] state situation is less clear. This will – in reality, we're talking about some sin taxing, which I'm not in favor of, but we have some expenses we need to face. We have – all these marijuana businesses are going to be opening on streets where homeless people sleep."
01_20_2016,homelessness,"I would hope that when we talk about the nitty-gritty of this regulation, we can also talk about how questionable things like sin taxes can be redeemed into ending homelessness, going beyond just the [ORGANIZATION] shelter and the new peace shelter, and also using some of this revenue to bring truly affordable subsidized housing. Thank you. Thank you very much."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"When I first took office, I asked [PERSON] to reexamine the boundaries, the duration, and the purpose of all of our existing urban renewal areas, 11 of them and six neighborhood prosperity initiative areas. In [ORGANIZATION], I brought to the [ORGANIZATION] proposed amendments to six of these urban renewal areas, and the [ORGANIZATION] then affirmed that direction and asked for more public outreach in a package that does the following, reduces the impact on taxing jurisdictions,  helps [ORGANIZATION] thrive, and provides resources for affordable housing. Those were the three things that we as a council said as we refined and developed this package."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"Those are the three things we want to do. Reduce the impacts on the taxing jurisdictions, help [ORGANIZATION], and support affordable housing. Throughout DATE0, we had a committee, and we're going to hear from some of them [TIME], that met to work on this package, and a majority of the committee supported it with only a minor change."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"And, in fact, that's already paying dividends to the city and the county and the school district's budgets. It'll increase, this package will increase resources for affordable housing and advance the implementation of our affordable housing goals. And it will help achieve the potential of [ORGANIZATION] and the new [ORGANIZATION] station areas in [LOCATION]."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"As the mayor mentioned and kind of summarized in a nice [STREET], we are here to revisit the direction of  that [ORGANIZATION] provided [ORGANIZATION]. So as the Mayor mentioned, and he highlighted these three specific goals about reducing the impact of urban renewal, supporting [PERSON], and preserving our investments in affordable housing and other development outcomes. And so we're here [LOCATION] to report back on how the proposed changes to their renewal areas deliver on that."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"And as you can see, just at a high level, we believe this package delivers on that. So as the mayor mentioned, we have dollars returning to the taxing jurisdictions. You'll see –  in detail the increases in investments in affordable housing in a variety of districts, but also some of the other development outcomes that we're going to be able to achieve with these changes."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"their recommendations and forwarding that to you. And we've also met with [ORGANIZATION]  As I mentioned, we did extensive public outreach. So in addition to convening [ORGANIZATION] and developing recommendations from them, we developed a housing subgroup from that so that we could deal specifically with questions around affordable housing."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"We've obviously had a significant amount of feedback on the objectives around affordable housing, with particular focus on the [ORGANIZATION] urban renewal area. I'll talk about that in a second. And I know there's lots of testimony that you're going to hear later on [ORGANIZATION], and they can shed light on those conversations."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"The district also has some additional needs in that southern end of the district that we believe could use additional public investment. And, of course, we want to continue to invest in affordable housing. So in addition to the expansion of the area, we also want to extend the life of the district by [ORGANIZATION]."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"And as you'll see in [TIME], this unlocks a substantial pool of resources for us to accomplish a variety of objectives in [ORGANIZATION] that include supporting the growth of [ORGANIZATION], obviously continuing to meet our affordable housing goals, as well as support other commercial development and provide the infrastructure to support that development. Where are the 10 acres that are not currently in the education district, and why are we adding those? So if you look in the map, it's the red."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"And then the next table, I just want to once again return everybody to the question of affordable housing. As we mentioned, this was one of the goals of this urban renewal area package. So as you can see, this is a net increase in investment in affordable housing."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"You can see where those funds come from. Obviously, there's a dramatic increase in the affordable housing investment in [ORGANIZATION]  the slight increase in [LOCATION] and us shifting current dollars in the remainder of LOC2 blocks, that offsets the loss of affordable housing investment that would have come from the education renewal area And so you see a total nominal gain of investment of $3.5 million, but because the investments are accelerated, meaning they happen sooner than they would have under the education or renewal area, the present value calculation actually makes it a higher number."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"So we get money for affordable housing sooner. We get more money sooner, and that's why the present value calculation is higher. Do you have similar tables for parks and transportation?"
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"Additional money is available for open space or other infrastructure needs. It allows us to have the money to invest in growth around [ORGANIZATION], money to support business growth in the area. And then last but not least, we have a significant increase in affordable housing from $9 million under the current projections to $47 million under the amended scenario."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"Yeah. So, as I mentioned earlier, as a result of public input, we spent a lot of time refining the plans for affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION], and we think we have a much better approach to affordable housing as a result. I mentioned the increase in resources."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"Lastly, before I know you have a question, we have an affordable housing provision in our development agreement with [ORGANIZATION]. Any other development agreements that are executed within this district would have language around affordable housing as well. A couple of points just for clarification."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"What is the nature of the affordable housing agreement with [ORGANIZATION]? Is that for university plates? So the agreement with [ORGANIZATION], in short, requires them to offer to the city to sell units in any residential housing project that they do, which would most likely be on FAC0."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"but but so so money is set aside for that and then you can see it gives us  some more opportunity to put money to work in supporting businesses and other individual projects, which we know we're going to need some kind of gap financing if we're going to focus on commercial industrial development in that district. And then it does increase the affordable housing numbers from $4 million to $10 million."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"And so if you look at historically what's been invested in [ORGANIZATION], I think the picture might look a little different. Can you point me to the [STREET] in this plan where it talks about affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION] and particularly in the expansion area? So right now, so we have – so [ORGANIZATION] is actually working on current project in essentially side that will add how many hundred some odd units in essentially side?"
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"Correct. Yeah. So anyway, so there's a current project that's using up PHP dollars now that  And [ORGANIZATION], assuming that the [PERSON] plan, a comp plan, comes back with us allowing housing to happen there, I think we would work with [ORGANIZATION], with their dollars, as well as I think other incentives we might be able to provide to develop affordable housing within that triangle."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"I think as we've talked about, I think, and essentially side, given that the numbers go from 4 to 10 million, still not a big pot of money, I do think this is a conversation that should also happen within the [ORGANIZATION] conversation. I think we have an opportunity, given the current zoning, to use our tools there to encourage affordable housing development that isn't as heavily subsidized as it is elsewhere because there's a lot of market interest in developing housing. Yeah."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"so i want to ask you a couple questions while you're still in the hot seat and we'll bring you back later um one of the questions was  If we move forward with parcel three and then at some point in [ORGANIZATION], we have a second site identified for affordable housing, what is the current –  framework for deciding the allocation between deeply subsidized units at zero to 30 and other units at 30 to 60, recognizing that when we use [ORGANIZATION], it has to be 60 and below to be eligible under the 30 percent set-aside policy. But what's the mechanism for deciding the next allocation and split between deeply affordable and affordable in any future development?"
02_26_2015,affordable housing,Correct. So that shuts down affordable housing investment as we know it. And the loss to [ORGANIZATION] is $216 million?
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"One was that we had to find an alternative [STREET] to support the growth and expansion of the university district, which is both good for [ORGANIZATION] and good for the city. And we had to find a [STREET] to compensate for the loss of the set-aside money for affordable housing in an area that was ripe for development. There was a lot of dirt that could be developed."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"And I appreciate in that regard that, as [ORGANIZATION] noted, the proposal to expand FAC0 actually accelerates the availability of dollars for affordable housing. So that's not just a sort of a neutral consequence. That actually puts us ahead in the short term in terms of available dollars."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"So overall, I think that this has been achieved in the recommendations before you, which deliver a significant net gain to the taxing jurisdictions while preserving key investment opportunities needed to realize [ORGANIZATION] goals. I particularly want to highlight a few areas relevant to our work at [ORGANIZATION], the [ORGANIZATION] downtown [ORGANIZATION] adjustments and the [PERSON] and affordable housing goals. By many measures, the [ORGANIZATION] has been a success."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,But the struggles present in the [ORGANIZATION] affordable housing conversation are reflective of the issues faced by the city as a whole. And illustrate that affordability and economic diversity in neighborhoods will not be achieved without a robust set of tools and resources coordinated across the city's bureaus. I want to applaud the city's ongoing look at zoning incentives and other tools to further affordability.
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"We are concerned about the amendments that were in earlier versions of the [ORGANIZATION] report about underdeveloped areas adjacent to FAC0. However, at the time that we were looking at it, it hadn't been identified for affordable housing. We are fine with affordable housing at FAC0."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"Other than affordable housing, we would prefer that the investments focus on transportation and infrastructure improvements such as that. The [ORGANIZATION] blocks on FAC0 have long been identified by our board as a priority for important development opportunity to add to the city's tax base. It's a high priority that we have development on the property that contributes to both the employment base of the city as well as the tax base."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"Although the [ORGANIZATION] appreciates the consideration staff have devoted to the [ORGANIZATION] affordable housing concerns, we cannot support adoption of the plan amendment until there is more certainty about how the housing goals will be met. More details on the number and affordability of units on the [ORGANIZATION] project,  and secure commitments for sites from each of the major property owners, [PERSON], ORG2, and [PERSON], are needed. The district's DATE0 extension and expansion is critical to their success."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"That should be used as leverage to acquire items that benefit the public, including land for affordable housing and parks. The public is understandably skeptical of the city's commitment to affordable housing and [ORGANIZATION]. DATE0 have passed and only 209 units have been developed."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"Long-time observers have seen the city release property owners from their affordable housing obligations in [ORGANIZATION], on [ORGANIZATION]'s FAC0, and with [PERSON] at the FAC1 site. Collectively, they represent close to 1,000 affordable units. The ORG2 recommends that you rebuild community trust by securing commitments for sites from the three major property owners before taking action and provide more details in the plan amendment."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"Again, we urge you to withhold approval of the amendment until there are more specifics on parcel 3 and firm commitments for affordable housing sites in the district. Thank you. Thank you."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"We also urge the city not to consider the [ORGANIZATION] planned development to be the fair exchange for urban renewal dollars. Per the development agreement, the [ORGANIZATION] do not have to develop anything unless the market is there. The city should stay firm that the [ORGANIZATION] must commit to affordable housing, parks,  and FAC0 improvements in exchange for urban renewal dollars."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"And I want to start by saying, and I apologize for my voice, I'm going to head home soon, but I believe that you are, if not the indispensable person, an indispensable person on this affordable housing piece. And I just want to thank you for service on the committee. Thank you.  for holding our feet to the fire and for the quality of your advocacy."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"Our little rump group of the old-timers or the old bats or whatever we call ourselves has not... Speak for yourself. I know, speaking for myself. I am, I am the Scrooge that...  we just don't think this is specific enough there isn't enough agreement as to what will be developed and when it will be developed and we want to see more of that specificity it doesn't sound like it's there on the parks or on the housing and I'm just begging you to reserve this very critical tool  Like it or not, it is a critical tool that the city has to finance affordable housing and use it wisely."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"You could easily spend the money. but that's not the goal the goal is to build housing for lower income people the need to secure land for affordable housing was identified as fundamental to meeting the housing goals in [ORGANIZATION] when this [ORGANIZATION] was established in [LOCATION] when the housing strategy was adopted and several times since it is still literally the foundation of a successful housing strategy yet it has not been done  Most of the infrastructure has been built, thousands of market rate condos and apartments, office, retail, parking garages, hotels. But [ORGANIZATION] there is still only one building with 209 units of affordable housing."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"In DATE0 of the district, this lot was slated to be the centerpiece of the city's affordable housing strategy. In fact, by [LOCATION], the city had invested over $6 million to secure this site for 400 units of affordable housing. No housing has been built there, and the city has now released the owner of the site, [ORGANIZATION], of its obligation to make it affordable for housing."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,Yet it appears that at least $3 million of ORG0 housing funds are still tied up at the site. Thank you. I suggest the city considers entering an agreement with [ORGANIZATION] to build affordable housing there if you do indeed still have a stake in the property.
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] has had the use of city funds for over [ORGANIZATION], and during this period, property values have risen dramatically. Alternatively, [ORGANIZATION] could transfer another suitable site from their extensive holdings in the district.  for affordable housing for its low-income clients and workers. Similarly, PSUs should be required to make the site available for low-income housing."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"Allowing the city to buy land for affordable housing is a minimal requirement in exchange for past and future large public expenditures. Alternatively, [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] could pay to complete FAC0 and the other public infrastructures as developers must do in ORG2 projects. The city could then use this money for affordable housing and parks."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"And I think when I am with people from out of town visiting there,  They're astonished that they can't pick out the affordable housing in that neighborhood. It looks every bit as nice as the market rate rental apartments and condos. So that happened because we built those affordable properties early while the land prices were low, and the city held the developer to explicit standards."
02_26_2015,homeless; affordable housing,"the development period rather than at the front When everything was going to be more expensive and that was with the understandable rationale that [ORGANIZATION] producing projects had to be done first But secondly sites were not acquired while the land was cheap. I don't know how many meetings I went to where staff reported to us that they'd turned down a possible acquisition because the owner wanted too much money for it and then the prices would continue to escalate of course and  And finally, affordable housing is not required in the specific development agreements with property owners early on in the process. So as a result, we have nearly 3,000  very handsome condominium units and luxury apartments that have been built, but not a single unit of affordable housing until we began, until [ORGANIZATION] had passed, and only that sole project, I believe, was approved because it would provide housing for homeless veterans during a time of war."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"And now we have a chance to get some additional money, but I just want to point out that  As [ORGANIZATION] explained with the reconfigured urban renewal districts, the net gain for affordable housing across all districts is only $3.5 million, $3.5 million, which is 10% of what's been spent to date  in [ORGANIZATION] to get one single project accomplished. So it's a very small amount of money. It's $48 million in [ORGANIZATION], but that's because we're taking money out of the education district and other districts."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"We were supposed to get 400 units of affordable housing out of that. I think we need to go back and say, how do we somehow make up for that? It's not necessarily that same plan of parking underneath and housing above, but we need to do something to make up for what we lost when that agreement was allowed to go away."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,I assume you like that split. I very much appreciate the work that [ORGANIZATION] and his team have done to increase the resources for affordable housing in the district. I think it's important to keep the net amount in mind.
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"You have reminded us that as we continue to expand housing units in the district, that the denominator gets bigger. So the numerator has to get bigger. So it's the affordable housing goals are not static."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"They grow over time because we have to look at the income profile of the city and we have to constantly adjust based on the number of units that are built generally. You've said, you've reminded us that our affordable housing goals that were set once upon a time assumed a certain number of overall units, and as the district gets more units, we have to add more affordable housing units to maintain the right proportion. Well, if I may, it's not quite that, because when that deal was cut in [ORGANIZATION], the constrained funding system  said we're going to cut our goals back by 64 percent until we reach 3,000, then we're going to go back to the matching city income profile."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"And this is not a competition of parks, infrastructure, and housing, because we believe that if  a good diverse neighborhood should have parks. And so we think you ought to do parks and affordable housing. The real question is, what is the priority down there, and how do you spend that money and when?"
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"We heard that's a tough issue, and that's a barrier to affordable housing, and we support getting more operating dollars. [ORGANIZATION], the [ORGANIZATION] development, we strongly support affordable housing in that development. And a question that we had and a discussion we had was if this was an inclusionary zoning, which we support, we've testified for, we've said we're putting in the comp plan, we've done everything to try to get it for [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] would support  pay or build affordable housing."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"However, in the [ORGANIZATION] district, the city has to pay to do affordable housing, and not sure why that is. Unless, of course, he chose just to do commercial buildings. Unless he chose to do just commercial buildings."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,And it doesn't have the money we think for affordable housing either to reach the number. So that's the change in looking at that 30% to 70% allocation. You have to change that number or you just don't have enough money when you look at the budget.
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"I expect that [ORGANIZATION] has concerns, but I'm certain that [ORGANIZATION] is willing to work with the city in getting a temporary greenway built. This is not only important for the residents, but it is an incentive for workers and employers and everyone soon to be taking advantage of FAC0. What I would also like to say is, as a representative of ORG2, we are also very supportive of affordable housing."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,So it's not that we're looking for transportation or affordable housing. We're looking for both. Thank you very much.
02_26_2015,housing crisis,"In [ORGANIZATION], we had a countywide shortage of 10,000 units for households at 30% of median income or less. Fast forward [LOCATION] to DATE2, and our shortage countywide is 23,245 units. We have a severe housing crisis, and the poorest of the poor are the ones in greatest jeopardy."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"And I think we all understand the need. So what are we going to do about it?  Identifying FAC0 as a site for affordable housing is a terrific first step. We've been told there can be 400 units on the site, and we're looking at one building of 200 units."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"As you know, [ORGANIZATION] manages the one affordable housing project in [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and thank you, [ORGANIZATION], for that story. And I'll just offer one other example of how affordable housing gives back to the community. One resident at [ORGANIZATION] is also a board member at [ORGANIZATION]."
02_26_2015,homeless,"My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I'm the Director of [ORGANIZATION], which shelters or houses approximately 350 homeless families [TIME]. This is about 1,100 homeless people, about 600 homeless kids, and about 500 homeless parents."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"I also serve on [ORGANIZATION], although I'm certainly not speaking for the commission DATE0. But I think that when [ORGANIZATION] meets [LOCATION] and we talk about these issues, I'd like to offer that [ORGANIZATION] do the monitoring on the progress of how many affordable units we have produced once we agree on a goal. According to an analysis completed by [ORGANIZATION], in [ORGANIZATION], there's at least 23,000 affordable housing units that are in deficit, which would mean that these are units that are needed for the lowest income renders but are not available."
02_26_2015,homeless,"For us, this deficit means that although homeless families have vouchers to be able to get out of the shelter or get out of the situation of being homeless, they're not able to find apartments or apartment owners that will rent to them. As a result, they are stuck in the shelter or they're doubled up with family and friends, sometimes in unsafe situations. I'd like to ask you to imagine yourself as the parent in a homeless family, and you have several homeless children with you, and you finally, finally, finally get yourself out of the emergency shelter by having a voucher that you can take to a landlord, and it'll pay for [ORGANIZATION] worth of rent, and you go to apartment after apartment after apartment, and no one will rent to you."
02_26_2015,homeless,"And then someone asks you, how many units should they build in [ORGANIZATION], 62 or 200 or 400? And  If you were that homeless parent, you wouldn't say 62, I don't think. For every 100 extremely low income renters, there's only 21 affordable rental units for them to rent."
02_26_2015,homeless,"For [ORGANIZATION], we have 700 units. Our vacancy rate is 1 percent, which means we have seven vacant units at any time, and they're only vacant for as long as it takes to turn over the unit and the next family moves in. As you know, being homeless is harmful both short-term and long-term to parents as well as to children."
02_26_2015,homeless; affordable housing,"Children have a very hard time keeping up in school if they're homeless. Parents can't keep jobs if they're homeless. But this lack of affordable housing and the 23,000 deficit in affordable housing units is what keeps these families being homeless."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"Part of the solution, of course, is to build more affordable housing. I would just like to ask you in summary to think about whether or not we have enough affordable housing for all of our citizens, whether or not we can purchase land now to make it more cost effective, and if we can identify strategies to build housing for very low-income people and write that into the plan so that we're certain that it would happen. Thank you."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,I'm PERSON0. I'm executive director of [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] is a statewide association that advocates for affordable housing groups.
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"percent MFI. And so I know recently we had an issue in northeast [ORGANIZATION] where there was an affordable housing imbalance and Mayor [PERSON], you made a bold move and dedicated $20 million to meet that need. We see that this is a good opportunity for perhaps another bold move such as that to try to meet these goals."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"Also, in the central east side [ORGANIZATION], there should be language to ensure that there's a firm commitment to securing affordable housing in [LOCATION] or on other sites. So there are many developers and owners here that are ready to jump in. We know that there's not enough money, and right now we're trying to solve it with [ORGANIZATION] funds."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"And again, if we wait [ORGANIZATION], let's say it takes [ORGANIZATION] to conclude a negotiation or more, we can't compel that negotiation. Are we prepared to hold that negotiation?  hostage, in effect, to a development agreement that may not happen where we have the money to move forward on a substantial down payment of affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]. I didn't realize there was a tie between the ORG0 development agreement and [ORGANIZATION]."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"But one of the things I'm concerned about is holding an affordable housing development in FAC0 hostage to a requirement that we have a development agreement with [ORGANIZATION] that might not happen if Mr. [ORGANIZATION] chooses not to consummate a deal. And I understand the dilemma, and I think there's a [STREET] to have both. Okay."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"But the vast majority of the housing need is for people in low and moderate incomes. And if this process in [ORGANIZATION] is any example to us of how it's going to go, that need is not going to get met. Without strategies for preserving a real diversity of housing in our older neighborhoods, you won't even be able to build sufficient affordable housing in the central city to offset those losses, never mind increase the supply."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,We can't do what needs to be done for this city around the affordable housing strategy simply by investing public dollars. That's going to have to be a necessary part of the strategy. It cannot be all of it.
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"PERSON0 reminds me, I was chair when I was at [ORGANIZATION] as a county elected official, and [ORGANIZATION] I don't miss that job in watching all of you guys grapple with these issues. I did have a chance to chair the affordable housing, regional affordable housing committee. A lot of those tools were discussed thoroughly again after that [LOCATION] conversation."
02_26_2015,homelessness,"And we did help [ORGANIZATION] work very closely with the city of [PERSON] on a [ORGANIZATION] plan to end homelessness. I'm really here just to say that I'm wanting to support this group of housing advocates who bring this amazing institutional memory to these efforts to try to create real housing opportunities for people. A lot's happened in [LOCATION], but I think we could all agree that we haven't come even close to meeting the progress we know is necessary to meet the needs of  and it has now become imperative."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"I was at FAC0. My friend was actually camping down in the area, and he says, this is down by the end of the streetcar line. And I went down there, and we were..."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,We're memorializing the fact that the affordable housing wasn't built. That was [ORGANIZATION]. I know that we're putting on a lot of airs here in the city of [ORGANIZATION].
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"Well, the whole scheme here is I was living in affordable housing as a person with a disability and I had a job. And my non-profit affordable housing landlord filed a [ORGANIZATION] no-cause and destroyed $20,000 worth of my property."
02_26_2015,homeless,"That left me broke, sick, and homeless. And now, taxpayers are paying for me to be in [ORGANIZATION]-subsidized housing. I'm the metric equivalent of that dog that you all are using to do your metric equivalent of importing hashish."
02_26_2015,homeless; affordable housing,"You're taking the federal money. This is all about taking federal money, building...  transit infrastructure, and taking federal money. So me as a homeless person was worth more than me as a person with a disability, with a job, in affordable housing."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"And in the discussions on [ORGANIZATION], of which I was on the [ORGANIZATION] member, it was a top priority for this district to have the [ORGANIZATION] completed. [PERSON] and the [ORGANIZATION] have been promised, but underfunded in the past, and [ORGANIZATION] their full funding continues to be vague and on the back end. We need both affordable housing and the parks and [ORGANIZATION] to become a priority."
02_26_2015,houseless,"um i i think that there's different motivations that folks have for talking to you guys um with all due respect you know a property developer is is motivated on profit you know these housing advocates they're motivated for protecting [ORGANIZATION]'s uh houseless and under house citizens and the integrity of our city you know um  I went to a thing called [ORGANIZATION] last night. There was about 20 of us. And what we were talking about was specifically how the rents are increasing in  you know, while our incomes aren't matching those increases."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"we've got to hold their feet to the fire. You know, we have to find ways to be very specific about where this money goes and how much of it gets dedicated, you know, to the affordable housing. And we have to follow through on it."
02_26_2015,homelessness; affordable housing,"You know, I keep hearing time and time again about all these grand plans to end homelessness and all these grand plans to create affordable housing. And somehow it doesn't happen. You know, meanwhile, these developers, they have no horse in this game."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"So we need to think about housing people who are making what we realistically do make, which is 35%, 40%. Some people make 20% of that number. So I think that a very key thing to talk about with affordable housing is what is affordable."
02_26_2015,homeless,"and no green spaces, no parks, as the lady has pointed out, or minimal. And then my friend PERSON0 talks about MFI, medium family income, and Mr. [PERSON] was just up here, and he's worked with various nonprofits that take their clients and they code them into a computer where the clients get a barcode on a plastic card, not on their body. That's for HMIS, probably some federal contract, [ORGANIZATION],  except the last three letters are a lie."
02_26_2015,homelessness,"It's just homelessness. There's no management, there's no information, and there's no system. There might be information, but we have people, we don't ever have a clear, coherent discussion at [ORGANIZATION] or here about exactly how many people are never, ever going to have an income above $790 or whatever the latest ORG1 adjustment is, and that we absolutely have to have information  an equal, exactly equal number of units for those people as people are that are getting ORG1 checks."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"That information is out there, but we never seem to pair up that information. And then we have the issue of the working poor, as [ORGANIZATION] has raised, people who really don't have any rational connection through their pocketbook to median family income and poverty level. And every time we have these conversations, I realize we're primarily talking about urban renewal, but essentially we're using part of our urban renewal strategy is  to find more affordable housing units."
02_26_2015,homeless,"But we never set, we never talk specifically about the data of how many people are under there and that if developers want to make any profit on real estate, they have to find a [STREET] to fill that need. If they can't fill that need, they can't have any assistance and we need to have publicly owned and managed properties, understand their federal obstructions to getting new northwest towers and new home forward owned properties.  let them sue us if we try and house our homeless. We need to get 3,[ADDRESS] and in sanitary safe housing."
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"And we're not going to have any more magic money flowing in for [ORGANIZATION]. So we need to be figuring out how are we going to provide the parks, and if not on FAC0, then where else could a park be that's going to need money for acquisition as well as development? How are we going to get the FAC1 effect  finished, which we don't currently have that money in the parks budget, and how are we going to do the necessary transportation improvements, as well as how are we going to get at least 270 units of very affordable housing and hopefully to 400."
02_18_2016,homeless,"This is an important life safety issue for the employees of the adjacent businesses as well as potential residents of a homeless camp. The inability of adjacent businesses to use the right-of-[STREET] for safety, egress, and safe delivery of chemicals creates a liability for the city's general fund. It's not prudent for the city to pursue...  vacating this [STREET]."
02_18_2016,homeless,"I've been working at [ORGANIZATION] and have been parking on the south side of the facility for much of that time. I recall a time not too long ago when 45 employees worked here and we sometimes operated around the clock. [PERSON], homeless campers obstructed access to the southern door of our waste treatment area and the chemical delivery driver was not willing to risk delivery due to obstruction."
02_18_2016,homeless,"My daughter is on the board of [ORGANIZATION], and I have been hearing quite a bit about the problems of the homeless in that area. Okay. And so I hear this nightly at the dinner table."
02_18_2016,homeless,"My daughter voted against the vacation of this [STREET], so I know all about it. And I'm saying that a good deal of the objection to the vacation of the [STREET] has to do with not the homeless problem in that area. And so I would recommend that the city do something about  in a major fashion, to deal with the homeless issue, in particular with that area."
02_18_2016,homeless,"Hello. My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I'm a homeless advocate at [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], and I've chaired my tribal housing authority, chaired my tribal enterprise board."
02_18_2016,homelessness,"It actually made it through the legislature in a veto of the governor. So we've been down this [STREET] quite often dealing with homelessness, and so I would advocate support for this proposal. It is an interim proposal."
02_18_2016,homelessness,"It is not the definitive solution to homelessness. It's only a temporary facility. If you look at the future of this facility and say, yes, we would like to build permanent low-income housing and provide this to this organization, then that should be a covenant as well and a fair market value for them to purchase the property at an established price so that they could go forward with future development."
02_18_2016,homeless,"Thank you. Published reports of the [ORGANIZATION] community has been we're opposed to all homeless programs, as I've read in publications. Thank you very much."
02_18_2016,homeless,"yet we're on the big [STREET] vacation just the [STREET] but i'm just saying that there there was um rvs parked there [ORGANIZATION] during one of the biggest uh homeless sweeps that we filmed uh from fight the sweeps portland at a third and FAC0 so um  there was definitely deliveries going on [LOCATION] with the chemicals and all that so i don't see that there's any um real issue with because that space has been vacated and basically that video is just to show their angle and their narrative it's very easy to  As a videographer and stuff, I could actually just prove the same thing with my little video camera. Or I could prove that there's plenty of room to actually move."
02_18_2016,homeless,"We've been in that state of emergency now for [ORGANIZATION] now. During that time, we have, as a community, between the efforts of the City of [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], and local churches, opened more than 400 new shelter beds in our city. We have finished housing our backlog of homeless veterans, although there are, of course, new homeless veterans [LOCATION], and they need to be housed as well."
02_18_2016,homeless; homelessness; affordable housing,"But we began [ORGANIZATION] with 690 homeless veterans in [ORGANIZATION], and we housed 695. That's a good start. The council has dedicated $354 million, say that again, $354 million to affordable housing and homelessness."
02_18_2016,homelessness,"And so we're not here to deliberate on the housing strategy, the bigger homelessness issue. What we're looking at is, is this a good [STREET] for the successful [ORGANIZATION] community to have a new location? Thank you."
02_18_2016,houseless,"It's important to describe some key elements of the proposed use, but you're going to hear more about the proposed use from [ORGANIZATION] and representatives of [ORGANIZATION] later. But what we're looking at here is a rest area with tents providing [TIME] shelter for houseless individuals. It would be operated by [ORGANIZATION], which is a nonprofit organization."
02_18_2016,houseless,"Tents would range in size from one- to two-person tents to up to ten-person tents. structures with approximately 2,100 square feet of net building area containing restrooms, showers, laundry facilities, a kitchen, and storage for personal belongings would be provided. Other houseless individuals who are not sheltered at the rest area may also use some of the facilities, as Commissioner [PERSON] said."
02_18_2016,houseless,It provides shelter and stability. There are no membership requirements. Amenities at the site would be available to other houseless individuals as well as those who take shelter at the site.
02_18_2016,homeless,"Primaries actually didn't go up when we moved in. They actually went down a little tiny bit. So we are in solidarity with many organizations, including the Homeless Bill of Rights,  [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, ORG3ORG4ORG5, ORG6, ORG7, which is a selfORG4defense class that happens once a month, [ORGANIZATION], ORG9, [PERSON]0, [PERSON]1, and other camps like FAC0 and [PERSON]2, which is going trying to be established out in southeast, outer southeast."
02_18_2016,houseless,"Sure. We have pregnant women who have came through the rest area, and we referred them to midwives instead of sending them to the hospital where the question is asked if they're houseless or not, and that causes them to lose their children because they –  are required to report to the state that an individual is houseless so if i can just follow up that was my question so there are absolutely no children living at right to dream too that is correct anyone under [ORGANIZATION] is not allowed and that rule will apply to the new location as well yes it will okay thank you"
02_18_2016,houseless,"So when you look at it from the [STREET], what you see is that these houseless people are actually doing things like trying to support, um, distressed [ORGANIZATION] populations by providing pollinator habitat, um,  through their sculptural door wall that they'll be bringing over from their [ORGANIZATION] location. They'll be creating a beautiful edge that is lovely to look at and makes a statement about community. And when you arrive at the site, there will be a gateway which announces that you've arrived at something of a village of people that is a cultural space, so it'll be a lovely thing, and it'll speak to the [STREET] like the best kind of architecture must do in the urban city.  in the urban core."
02_18_2016,homeless,The land therefore should remain in a permitted use for which it was originally intended transportation. The existing right-of-[STREET] serves as viable access to emergency vehicles needed to direct access to the adjacent sites. This is an important life safety issue for the employees of the adjacent businesses as well as the potential residents of the homeless camp.
02_18_2016,homeless; homelessness,"Uses directly adjacent to the site are industrial, using industrial processes and providing employment in industrial district. Can I...  either that or just make sure we have a copy of your statement um i only have [TIME] um plans to vacate the [STREET] and locate a homeless camp on the site threaten the conditions of the permit approved for the adjacent industrial businesses future uses of the site that are not employment related and did not recognize the existing permits and that violate the social contract of [LOCATION] code should not be allowed emergency shelters and short-term housing of any type are plainly and expressly prohibited in the industrial zones  these are the primary uses contemplated by proposed action regardless of whether the use occurs in a building or not there will be people living residing staying on the site and using it for residential purposes [TIME] a day DATE0 a week many will stay [PERSON] and i think at least 14 of them will become permanent resident dreamers this is a residential use no other conclusion is plausible the site is adjacent to industrial facilities and uses  Establishing a homeless camp under these or any other conditions is not, in our opinion, a humane [STREET] of helping people experience the trauma of homelessness."
02_18_2016,homeless,No one is saying there should be no [STREET] to rest and we should not be proactive in helping homeless residents  but not in industrial sanctuary land where residential uses are strictly prohibited for all the reasons listed above. Thank you. Thank you.
02_18_2016,homelessness,"in his comments. I won't repeat them. And furthermore, we had some real frustrations about the public process surrounding the proposal, as well as the city's history of the phenomenon of homelessness is addressed."
02_18_2016,homelessness,"The fact that people are sleeping on the streets embodies a complex and many-faceted problem, and many of us already know a lot of the factors, so I'm going to kind of skip ahead in my notes. But I do want to comment that it's a difficult  to find a job and maintain employment if one has no address, no [STREET] to shower before an interview, and if one must carry all one's belongings to the interview, and if there is no [STREET] for [TIME]'s sleep and adequate assistance with medications and other means of managing chronic illnesses, be they mental health or addiction or those of a more physical, physiological nature, it's difficult to keep a job. We can talk about homelessness, ending homelessness, that's a dream."
02_18_2016,homeless,"so maintaining public process is critical we would ask and I would ask that the city continue their efforts to support right to dream to continue the efforts to work with the homeless and I've had to skip part of this and so I'm lost my [STREET]  In closing, let me say that we spent, and I spent, time over the course of [ORGANIZATION] and in DATE1 DATE2 working with [ORGANIZATION]."
02_18_2016,homeless,"We started this process by defining what ORG0 meant. And what we decided that meant as a group was that people are legally able to sleep there, that there are access to bathrooms, that there are clean facilities, that there is the ability to have heat or warmth, that there is oversight or support by people trained to support physical safety, that there is dry or overhead shelter, including tents or tarps, and that there is lighting designed to assure adequate safety. We specifically discussed a variety of options, acknowledging that the needs of the people sleeping outside our homeless neighbors are just as diverse as the needs of the housed population."
02_18_2016,homeless,"and for people of color in our community who we know are disproportionately represented among the homeless population. Facility-based shelter is not the only option, and it can't be the only option that we offer. These sites serve large numbers of people."
02_18_2016,homeless,"Yeah, and speaking of field, let me reiterate Commissioner [PERSON]'s suggestion that we get to public testimony. And there's no doubt going to be a need for council discussion about how this fits into our overall programmatic effort. But I guess I also want to remind the council, and you can ponder this while we –  deliberate later on this, and that is Commissioner [PERSON] is in the process of leading a process by which our homeless services staff are transferred to [ORGANIZATION]."
02_18_2016,homeless,"So this is a rest area, not a housing project. We will be in the housing project development business and [ORGANIZATION] will be in the homeless services business of the transition that Commissioner [PERSON] is leading  goes forward. And so I think it would certainly be appropriate for us to discuss with [ORGANIZATION] how this particular homeless service facility will be supported by local government."
02_18_2016,homeless,"I'm speaking as an individual [ORGANIZATION]. To illustrate my concerns, I'm going to tell you a short story. Within [PERSON], homeless people broke into four vintage railroad passenger cars that were stored in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]."
02_18_2016,homeless,"Since FAC0 will be a sanctioned camp on city property and since the camp will likely attract other homeless people to the area,  What liability will the city take on to help protect the irreplaceable rail equipment, historic rail equipment, that is on the nearby museum property? Good neighbor agreements have no teeth. Secondly, and just as important, the public process has been stifled and is broken."
02_18_2016,homeless,"Whoever would like to be first. My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I'm the secretary of the [ORGANIZATION], excuse me, of the [ORGANIZATION] chapter of [ORGANIZATION] of this city. And I'm not a member of LOC2, and I'm not a homeless person, and I'm not a business owner."
02_18_2016,homeless,"What I'm here to do is just tell you the truth about the matter of moving [PERSON]. When [PERSON] established itself [ORGANIZATION], if [ORGANIZATION] city government had the right attitude toward homeless, why that property owner would have been showered with praise for having provided [PERSON] with a [STREET] to do its healing of the community. On the contrary, the city government socked that property owner with $5,000 fee for his civic activity."
02_18_2016,homeless,"We're moving FAC0. It's a big deal to move FAC0 because we don't want the downtown area of our city to have a homeless camp in it. And I am telling you as a politician that if you wanted to demonstrate real community action, you would welcome a homeless camp in the middle of downtown [ORGANIZATION], and you would say that is how we make a statement about what our community consists of."
02_18_2016,homeless,"We regularly invest in improving our waste treatment and compliance systems. With temp living adjacent to an industrial chemical facility, permitting may be difficult to achieve and might impair our ability in the future to improve our processing services and desire to continually be the best and most cutting-edge metal surface finisher in the [ORGANIZATION] area. Please do not move the FAC0 homeless camp next to this industrial chemical facility."
02_18_2016,homeless,"In addition, [ORGANIZATION] has nondisclosure agreements with customers requiring us to secure the view of customer parts and protect the property. In the past, homeless campers have been found wandering the facility unattended, seeking services like tools, electricity, water, restrooms, et cetera. This has occurred in the past without any formal invitation to 100 campers to sleep nearby."
02_18_2016,homeless,"I am worried about controlling and restricting access to our facility. The perimeter of the building on the west and north sides include four overhead shipping doors that are regularly left open to support lift truck traffic.  to the production areas on [ORGANIZATION] since it gets hot in the building opening these doors improve the work environment for my employees i'm worried about our ability to control the volume of foot traffic that will likely disrupt our operations if a homeless camp is sited next to us  Although it may be [PERSON]'s intention to avoid disrupting our operations, campers slash residents change over regularly, and I doubt the effectiveness of their policies being followed or regarded by the host of others waiting for space in the camp area. Please do not approve a zoning revision allowing tent camping in the [LOCATION] industrial zone."
02_18_2016,homeless,"I'm very concerned about the homeless problem we have in [ORGANIZATION] and the direction the city is going to resolve it. I really want to make it clear that  I'm not against the homeless, and I'm not against R2-D2, because I have a sister that is homeless too and is in a shelter here in [ORGANIZATION]. And it concerns me to think that she's going to be living in a tent next to hazardous chemicals."
02_18_2016,homeless,"Please don't move R2D2 next to a hazardous chemicals. Thank you. My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I too realize that homeless people need a [STREET] to live, but I don't think the property next to FAC0 is a [STREET] for them."
02_18_2016,homeless,"i have a i've had adverse encounters with homeless living on the property before i've been afraid of the fighting that has occurred and of the drug use safety is my main concern other employees and myself are worried about our safety especially after dark we don't want to be afraid to come to work and worry about the number of homeless expanding around the general area as it has occurred it greatly has  When [ORGANIZATION] cleared the area [ORGANIZATION], hazmat staff needed to help clear the garbage and drug needles. It's my job to talk to customers, and they've complained about when homeless have approached them. I am worried our customers will no longer be willing to pick up or drop off parts for processing at our location."
02_18_2016,homeless,"I'm [PERSON], property owner in [ORGANIZATION]. I'm here not to discuss the inappropriateness of legalized camping in the city, but to rather propose solid alternatives that eliminate the need for the city to authorize camping. The city has an underutilized public asset in FAC0 that is directly adjacent to the bulk of city services located in [LOCATION] that directly support the homeless community in all stages of their situation."
02_18_2016,homeless,"The vessel is close to... The cost is $249,000, less than $900 per bunk bed, for temporary housing, and is one-tenth the cost of outdoor camping sites. As men are the vast majority of homeless, I would use this for single males."
02_18_2016,homeless,"This one asset can make a significant impact in providing dignified alternative housing for presently homeless. If all four vessels were purchased, the total investment would be about $3 million, providing transitional housing for 1,500 people. I encourage the city to look for alternatives that provide real solutions and also protect every citizen's right."
02_18_2016,homeless,"And I also think that he should help his sister, the homeless one. So I'm sorry Mr. [PERSON] is not here because he's speaking for [PERSON], our housing commissioner, [ORGANIZATION]. Unfortunately, I don't know why."
02_18_2016,homeless,"The city pays $10,000 per year per homeless person. R2-D2 charges nothing. They've charged nothing to the city."
02_18_2016,homeless,"They're the only business that's going to be even near this homeless camp, right? Right. And yet everything seems to be based on their testimony, how it's going to affect their business, whether a truck can back in or not."
02_18_2016,homeless,"They have been using a public parking space.  beat up old parking lot with holes in it for [ORGANIZATION] for free and then once they find out that there's a homeless camp that might go There temporarily all of a sudden there's half the crew here, right? I think it's just disgusting They need a [STREET] to go and this is a [STREET] they should go. I  Not only there, but there needs to be about 20 more."
02_18_2016,homelessness,"Thank you. PERSON0 on behalf of [ORGANIZATION]. We can all agree that homelessness is one of the great moral challenges that we're facing in our community, and it needs a humane and immediate solution."
02_18_2016,homeless,"I understand that the objections I am going to raise here to the current solution may be uncomfortable. But I have faith, based on my past experience in front of this council, that you'll listen to these concerns, ask me any appropriate questions, and please know that this testimony is not anti-homeless and it's not anti-right to dream. The city's land use opinion calls this use a community service use, but not a residential community service use."
02_18_2016,homeless,"Those in the homeless community deserve compassion and respect, not to be swept under a tarp next to freight rails and hazardous materials and away from services. Our concerns can be boiled down to three points. The move's going to cause irreparable harm to the area, not just to FAC0."
02_18_2016,homeless,"And we restored our city's oldest reinforced concrete office building to become one of its most energy-efficient buildings as part of [ORGANIZATION] headquarters expansion. our city's top job creating firms have responded and will number in excess of a thousand employees working at full completion working within a four to five block radius of this site we believe the decision to locate a homeless camp in this immediate area is counterproductive to the city's goals and objectives related to sustainable economic development publicly supported planning and zoning and long-term return on public investment infrastructure  But most importantly, we're concerned this proposal isn't humane, nor is it a viable and long-term solution. We encourage you to address one of the most pressing human topics in our city with inspired and empathic leadership."
02_18_2016,homeless; homelessness,"Welcome. Go ahead. Hi, my name is [ORGANIZATION] with [ORGANIZATION], or [PERSON] as we're known to our friends."
02_18_2016,homeless,"and i personally lived under the the over ramp uh of FAC0 here where the old plating company was right across the [STREET] and it doesn't seem to have seemed to have done anything to me i'm sorry let me interrupt you for a second mr [ORGANIZATION] this is not okay you're going to need to have a seat and let people come participate in their [ORGANIZATION] meeting without being harassed thank you go have a seat please go ahead sorry  their seats we'll make sure one's available to you go ahead as somebody who is homeless or living in a van for [ORGANIZATION] and finally got off the streets through the vash program because i'm a veteran i'm a disabled veteran we need to find places in neighborhoods where you can do it they found it [ORGANIZATION] when they tore all the things down they built these small 20 25 housing unit units in the  in the neighborhoods of the area, and they found out that the crime and the gang rates dropped, like, by 75%. We need to do that with the homeless population in here."
02_18_2016,homeless,Get them out among the folks. Let them know what's going on. Get them in a camp where they can be supervised and allowed to be able to have a phone and other uses for the homeless.
02_18_2016,homeless,"Right. So I could see in [ORGANIZATION], you know, [PERSON] when I was homeless living in [ORGANIZATION], I mean, I can't believe what it's done. And it's great."
02_18_2016,homeless,"And I think that once it's out there, that people will realize that it's not going to draw all this crime. And it's not going to draw a whole bunch of homeless people that are going to crawl in your doors when they're open in [ORGANIZATION] just to see what they can find. And I think that focusing on a truck backing up is a ridiculous [STREET] to deal with  a situation and right to dream too isn't a permanent solution"
02_18_2016,homeless,"I've served on [ORGANIZATION], land use chair of two different neighborhood associations, and was the chair of ORG1 when we did the last neighborhood plan in [ORGANIZATION]. All of that said, the biggest, most spectacular ask I ever made of myself was right here in one of these chairs talking about homeless issues. So I'm here to try to, you know, recapture some dignity by offering you something useful, hopefully this time."
02_18_2016,homeless,unless me too okay go ahead please while he's getting settled okay um good [TIME] commissioners mayor um my name is [ORGANIZATION] and i run a project called [ORGANIZATION] which is exploring and prototyping low-cost housing solutions for low-income and homeless populations for [ORGANIZATION] i've been researching and visiting homeless and low-income housing around the country on [ORGANIZATION] and um  And I'm in the area just recently.
02_18_2016,homeless,and I read that I picked up the Colombian as a picture here. Politicians are making a big dog and pony show out of this thing. It's 30 units that caters to the homeless people just like these guys around here are six million dollars.
02_18_2016,homeless,Is it humane to see some homeless person going through the garbage can to get their next meal or panhandling to get a couple bucks to go up to [ORGANIZATION] and order off the value menu? i mean this is you know i may have a warped sense of what humane is but that ain't it and as far as you know the guys from ORG1 i've worked in a company for [ORGANIZATION] that had uh or does have a anodizing line that anodized [ADDRESS] I do support the move you know
02_18_2016,affordable housing,"I'm chairperson of [ORGANIZATION], former board member of [ORGANIZATION], and helped to establish the model that we have now. It astounds me that we have been at FAC0 and FAC1 since [ORGANIZATION]. We've been in chambers [LOCATION], sometimes DATE2, discussing [ORGANIZATION] and the need for more [ORGANIZATION]s and the need for more low-impact, low-barrier, affordable housing units."
02_18_2016,houseless,"And...  No, FAC0 and FAC1 is not the ideal spot, but that is the location that is on the table for us. And no, we will not be bringing more houseless people into the [ORGANIZATION]. They're already there."
02_18_2016,homeless,I got an amputated leg because I was homeless on your streets. I went to your dim city. You know what?
02_18_2016,homeless,"We work with cannabis people there. I go DATE0 DATE1 in a row. I don't see these clowns out there feeding the homeless, but I was out there in my wheelchair feeding them food, putting shirts on their backs."
02_18_2016,homeless,"and I'm homeless and I don't care now. I want you, Mayor, to call the president up and ask for the same thing [ORGANIZATION] did."
02_18_2016,homeless,"I'm PERSON0. I want to thank [ORGANIZATION] for saving my marriage, saving my life. I was [ORGANIZATION], I was homeless [ORGANIZATION], and [PERSON], my sister-in-law brought me up to [ORGANIZATION]."
02_18_2016,homelessness,"And they took us off the streets, and they showed me what homelessness was all about. They helped me get off drugs. Yeah, so that's why I'm here."
02_18_2016,houseless,"My name is [ORGANIZATION], co-founder of [ORGANIZATION], founder of [ORGANIZATION], and co-founder of ORG2, too. I've been in the houseless community in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], for [ORGANIZATION]. And I always face these adversities with people speaking on what things they don't know and of fear."
02_18_2016,houseless,"And if they did their homework, they would know that FAC0 is a houseless community, but it's a houseless community where people come and  and try to get back into the mainstream of things. And we figured out the first thing that a helpless person needs is rest. And that's why we call it a rest area where people come get rest."
02_18_2016,homeless,Why are you playing like you're concerned about us not? You didn't come help us out. I was an aerospace technician and quit my job to help the homeless community out.
02_18_2016,houseless,"What are you all doing to help us out by trying to ridicule us and say how bad and nasty and ugly we are, which we should be afraid of you all because we're doing the things  that we need to do to become productive while you keep putting those negativities on us. We ask the city for no penny. We've been operating [ORGANIZATION], too, by teaching the houseless community how to write grants, how to do public speaking."
02_18_2016,houseless,"We can train the people how to be flaggers for the trucks that come in. We have people in the community that did all kinds of things in their life, even truck drivers. That's two spoken here, and they know how it is.  to [STREET] trucks and you're talking about people with experience, again, that's that negative thought that shows me you don't know what you're talking about because everybody in the houseless community was something before they became houseless."
02_18_2016,homeless,"Give her a hand there. Thank you. Hi, my name is [ORGANIZATION], and I'm a homeless advocate, also co-founder of [ORGANIZATION] and a board member."
02_18_2016,homeless,"The mayor, we had a conversation when you had this emergency for the homeless, and my comment to you was –  The working homeless people are asking why are they rewarding homeless people that have vices, drugs, alcohol, mentally ill, with housing? Where's my housing at? A lot of these homeless individuals are like that."
02_18_2016,homeless,"So I was considered a chronically homeless person. People consider somebody like me that's been out there for [ORGANIZATION], oh, well, he likes it out there. That's why he's doing that."
02_18_2016,homeless,"He doesn't want this. It wasn't that. It was just that I wasn't going to play that system and say, look, yeah, everybody, every homeless person is on drugs and alcohol."
02_18_2016,affordable housing,"Well, Right to Dream [ADDRESS] until there's enough affordable housing for everybody. It's not a permanent solution. This is what's happening right now is what we're talking about and what I believe [PERSON] was talking about, getting people together."
02_18_2016,homeless,"That is my goal, and that's what I would like, people to get together and understand that not every homeless person is on drugs, alcohol, mentally ill. When you talk about mentally ill, also, you're talking about sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation is when homeless people don't get that chance to sleep at [TIME] because of the sweeps."
02_18_2016,homeless,"Now, they're walking around like zombies. They don't make good decisions. And when they react to that kind of stuff, then people start pointing their finger and saying, oh, look, that homeless person's on drugs."
02_18_2016,homeless,"Oh, look, that homeless person is mentally ill. No, sleep deprivation, it's big out there. And this is why it's needed, right, to train too."
02_18_2016,homeless; affordable housing,We need to start... Putting more stuff on out there other than affordable housing ways of getting homeless people inside a safe secure [STREET] So thank you for this. Thank you.
02_18_2016,homeless,"I'm talking about the community that is the right to dream to and the city's plan to uproot it and move it to a [STREET] that is further from social services.  further from their community and from all outward appearances, is in the corner of [ORGANIZATION]. Currently located at FAC0 and FAC1, there are many crucial services within only a [TIME] walk. You have [ORGANIZATION], which...  addresses changing needs of the homeless and low-income youth."
02_18_2016,homeless,I would ask that you actually incorporate that into this agreement to give protections to this simple nonprofit working on a shoestring. I appreciate your work. I've worked with homeless people since [ORGANIZATION].
02_18_2016,homeless; homelessness,"So I'm [PERSON] with [ORGANIZATION] and also founding member of  GPE0 Cop Watch. I just wanted to say that R2D2 reduces crime, reduces homelessness, and is a service to the community in ways that no other city agency or county agency or other community agencies have provided. And I not only endorse them getting this spot, I endorse them getting 10, 20 more spots since they've shown themselves to be such a  Great organization that actually does put a serious dent in the homeless problem."
02_18_2016,homeless,"And, you know, there's a lot of different people here that have argued all this various stuff about city codes and all this other stuff. Well, you want to know what? The homeless state of emergency overrides all these various city codes in a lot of ways."
02_18_2016,homeless,"So all you yuppies are just going to have to deal with the new deal and realize that the city is finally going to do a few things for homeless people. So you guys just need to shut up and do something yourself or come with some better plan since no one else has stepped up other than [ORGANIZATION]. And, you know, this is all about human survival, and all these [ORGANIZATION] arguments are just, you know, I don't know."
02_18_2016,homeless,"I can't even believe some of the stuff I've heard here [ORGANIZATION]. And this guy is talking about apartheid. [PERSON], homeless apartheid, is a huge reality everywhere."
02_18_2016,homeless,"And you can go look at a video on [ORGANIZATION] by [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], that I helped film. It's called [PERSON]. So I endorse [ORGANIZATION]."
02_18_2016,homelessness,We couldn't agree more that we as a community need to be doing more to help those experiencing homelessness on our streets. So we very much agree about that. I will limit my comments.
02_18_2016,homeless,and we're still working on there do you have a thought on that it it's still a draft i think that can be determined you're the mayor do you have a view as to who should who should have oversight of this this particular development um you mean who on the city side well this is an agreement between the city and a non-profit we have uh FAC0 is overseen by [ORGANIZATION]  You said earlier that you are interested in moving the homeless services of the city to the county.
02_18_2016,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION], Mayor, has never managed a homeless housing or camp or program, to my knowledge, and we do. I appreciate the flexibility that we are operating under, but we do have a housing bureau. Well, we have an agreement with a nonprofit organization in the case of this property."
02_01_2018,affordable housing,"DATE0 addressing several equity concerns of the LTIC charge through changes in code. And I believe in your exhibits, the highlighted sections are the ones that we added since [LOCATION]. The first code and rule update is an owner-occupied low-income exemption to complement the affordable housing exemption under consideration."
02_01_2018,homeless,"We tried to anticipate hardships when we first set the program up in [ORGANIZATION], so we carefully crafted language that anticipated a fire damage situation. A fire occurred, somebody needed to spend some time dealing with an insurance company to get funds secured to replace that structure, so we created a [LOCATION] exemption program  that if you're homeless, damaged due to fire, and you're replacing it, we wouldn't come in and charge this program. We're trying to expand that to a hardship, those cases that we don't know what might come at us, but set a system in [STREET] where somebody can make a hardship case come before the committee and have that evaluated."
02_01_2018,affordable housing,"So I came at this particular issue, asbestos and lead, in demolitions from three different places. One is I share half of his constituents, and I was hearing a lot about this,  Two, I am the chair of [ORGANIZATION], and so I was certainly hearing about demolitions, often from people who are very upset about demolitions and wanted to make sure that we're preserving our stock of affordable housing. So I do want to say on that note that I want to thank you for the city's support.  of [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] [DATE] coming up in the legislature to increase the document recording fee that goes to affordable housing."
02_01_2018,affordable housing,"Some of that is geared toward home ownership, and some of those home ownership dollars are used not only to help people with down payments and financial education,  but also for home repairs. And so the more that we can get money into home repairs so that people don't feel forced out of the affordable housing they have because they have a leaky roof or something like that is really important. On the other hand, I'm very supportive of demolitions when it makes [STREET] for more multifamily affordable housing."
02_01_2018,housing crisis; affordable housing,"So we've gone from a housing crisis to a housing glut with units going vacant and a lot of people really wishing for those cheaper, well-built houses that were put in the landfill. Coming back to this topic, hopefully we will see the fertility, the expense, and unnecessary loss involved in demolitions and stop them altogether. Keeping our viable, affordable housing and building only on vacant land."
01_06_2016,homelessness,"We're leveraging your investment in a number of ways in a public-private partnership, but also allowing us to address issues like housing and homelessness with kids that may end up in that [STREET] if we don't break the cycle of poverty. And we know that for every kid we can keep out of poverty over five generations, roughly 200 of their descendants will also be affected. So the leverage we're creating is tremendous."
01_06_2016,homeless,"Appreciate it. Okay, let's take item number four, please. Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding homeless suite, homeless state of emergency."
01_06_2016,homeless,"And I think that's conflicting with the homeless state of emergency. So I don't know how you guys are going to handle this, but you need to...  you know, cancel your contracts or alter them. And so homeless people aren't getting swept through these old existing contracts."
01_06_2016,homeless,"And also, you know, everyone's all patting you guys on the back for letting one more city-sanctioned homeless camp stay at [ORGANIZATION], which is, you know, only has a capacity of 40 people. You know, that's hardly worth a big amount of praise if –  that's all you've done in [ORGANIZATION] of your office when you've basically overpriced the city for a lot of people. And, uh,  So it's hardly making a dent."
01_06_2016,homeless,"I hope you'll start opening at least five or ten more city-sanctioned homeless camps and actually really make a dent instead of a minor league little dent. And also the [ORGANIZATION] situation, I saw it actually expand city land, and you guys get [ORGANIZATION] land, and then it expands your police powers to evict the homeless campers.  that aren't on the [ORGANIZATION] turf. And basically, the [ORGANIZATION] camp is already on city land, so I kind of see it as a legal [ORGANIZATION] land grab to expand police powers."
01_06_2016,homeless; homelessness,"And there's a lot of different things you could do to actually change the situation with homelessness. There's a thing called hot teams in other cities where they send out...  homeless outreach teams with various agencies when they go out with the police and, um,  have contact with homeless people, and they offer them services and other stuff. And by people constantly being swept around, it really makes it hard for service agencies to actually go provide services to the homeless people when they can't even find the people they're trying to service."
01_06_2016,homeless,"And there's another thing also. If you guys are going to have the police do a lot of outreach...  and contact with homeless people all the time, you might want to train them too in actually knowing how to navigate the social services of our city because they give out these little green pamphlets that have about nine addresses on it, and that's about all they do. And, you know, if you actually get some people to train them,  You know, so they actually know the various services and how..."
01_06_2016,houseless,"Thank you very much. Okay, item number five. Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel regarding humane solutions to being houseless."
01_06_2016,housing crisis,"So we were happy to see that the council committed 50% of [ORGANIZATION] budget surplus to infrastructure maintenance, and we urge you to commit to do the same for [LOCATION]. Now, we realize that the city has other urgent priorities, like the housing crisis,  But we think that committing 50% of surpluses to maintenance is important for a couple reasons. First, it's fiscally prudent."
01_06_2016,houseless,It's actually not just an issue for during track down time. It's something we actually need to be mindful of.  all the time as we deal with our houseless situation and the many people that sleep along FAC0. That's right.
02_21_2019,homelessness; housing crisis; affordable housing,"Colleagues, steep rent increases, very low vacancy rates, and housing demand that far outpaces supply precipitated an affordable housing crisis in [ORGANIZATION]. To address the tremendous suffering of unsheltered people and households on the brink of homelessness, [ORGANIZATION] declared a homelessness state of emergency back in [ORGANIZATION]. We're still very much in this state of emergency and continue to work in multiple ways to mitigate emergency conditions."
02_21_2019,affordable housing,"I know the crowd. So you can add emergency language from – Thank you. We just need to declare a reason why the emergency exists, and then we can –  The reason for the emergency clause, and just to be clear, the purpose of the clause is so that the ordinance takes effect immediately after passage as opposed to [ORGANIZATION] after the second reading, given that this is a very important issue.  given that the passage of this ordinance immediately will allow us to continue the flexibility that's provided for the expedited permitting of affordable housing, that this gives us the flexibility we need in the community to site both emergency shelter and alternative shelter, and given that this allows us to continue to site storage facilities,  What do you call them?"
02_21_2019,homeless,"Colleagues, we will now hear from our panel, [ORGANIZATION] from [ORGANIZATION], PERSON1 from ORG1, and PERSON2 from ORG2, and PERSON3 from ORG3. Good [TIME]. Thanks for being here."
02_21_2019,affordable housing,"Thank you. In [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] first established a housing state of emergency. This declaration of emergency gave the city expanded authority, as the mayor has said, to site day storage units, expeditiously issue permits for shelter and alternative shelters, and in [LOCATION], established an expedited design review process for new affordable housing developments."
02_21_2019,homelessness,"When the city first declared the emergency, we were experiencing some of the highest rent increases in the nation, coupled with an extremely low vacancy rate for housing, which unsurprisingly increased the number of people experiencing homelessness and needing shelter and permanent housing. In the intervening time, while rent growth has slowed and vacancy rates have increased, we have simultaneously doubled the number of people we are assisting with shelter and permanent housing, though the need in our community persists, and the need to continue the powers we were granted under the Declaration of Emergency continue. As a result of the emergency, the city's increased funding for housing and homelessness created new policies and programs to help us solve the crisis."
02_21_2019,affordable housing,"Since the time of the declaration, we have stepped up our investments in both housing and services. DATE0, we opened 800 new units of permanently affordable housing, providing stable quality homes throughout our community for more than 1,800 people. And [PERSON], we expect to open the doors to 1,000 more new units."
02_21_2019,affordable housing,"Since the initial declaration, the city has adopted a comprehensive inclusionary zoning program, ensuring that new developments are part of the solution to the crisis, not contributing to the problem. By requiring all the new developments, over 20 units include affordable housing. As a result, we already have over 362 units in process or in operation [ORGANIZATION]."
02_21_2019,homeless,I'd now like to turn it over to [ORGANIZATION] who's joining us from [ORGANIZATION]. Thank you. Greeting Mayor and Council Members.
02_21_2019,homeless,My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I'm the new Equity Manager for [ORGANIZATION]. I've actually been in the role for [ORGANIZATION] now.
02_21_2019,homeless,So this is my first large public meeting. I'm here [ORGANIZATION] on behalf of our Director [PERSON] and our Deputy Director [PERSON] who are both unfortunately not able to attend and are out of town. [ORGANIZATION] is very supportive of the proposal before you to extend the state of emergency for [LOCATION].
02_21_2019,homeless,"As [ORGANIZATION] pointed out, underneath the state of emergency, the city and the county have significantly increased investments in homeless services. And with these investments, we've been able to respond to the crisis in unprecedented ways. As tens of thousands of people have lost their homes, we've been able to respond by dramatically increasing our prevention, housing placement, and sheltering efforts."
02_21_2019,homelessness,"And I meant to say housing, as tens of thousands of people have lost their housing. As you can see here, since [ORGANIZATION], we've nearly doubled from just under 3,000 to nearly 6,000 people per year who we are helping escape homelessness through placement into permanent housing. During the same period of time, we've more than doubled from 4,000 to over 8,000 the number of people served in emergency shelter [LOCATION]."
02_21_2019,homeless,"In addition to expanding investments in overall system capacity, [ORGANIZATION] has used the state of emergency to expand the number of emergency shelters in our community at the fastest rate in [ORGANIZATION]. We have used the declaration of the state of emergency to help us open more than 650 new beds of [LOCATION] shelter for men, women, couples, families with children, veterans, and domestic violence survivors. We've distributed those shelters geographically, and we've removed the barriers that traditionally kept many of the most vulnerable people out of our shelters."
02_21_2019,homelessness,"We've also used the state of emergency to launch new alternative shelter, [ORGANIZATION], to help relocate [PERSON] and to begin the process of relocating [ORGANIZATION]. That work has led to more than doubling the number of people who have access to shelter [ORGANIZATION] in our community. And it helped lead to a reduction in unsheltered homelessness and a reduction in unsheltered chronic homelessness [DATE]."
02_21_2019,homelessness,"It focuses on finding permanent solutions for individuals and families who've experienced chronic homelessness and provides them with affordable quality housing and services they need to be successful in their housing and in the community. Within DATE0 of operation, we already have brought on 162 new units of supportive housing and have [DATE] of our goal in progress or planned. We also are bringing innovative solutions to our work with new funding from the state, county, and city to create low-cost innovative models, including 78 new units we recently announced and two new developments with [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]."
02_21_2019,homeless,"Good [TIME], Mayor [PERSON], Commissioners. My name is [PERSON]. I'm the Director of [ORGANIZATION] at [ORGANIZATION]."
02_21_2019,homelessness,I'd like to take just a moment to thank you all for your commitment and the work that you have done over [ORGANIZATION] to help people who are experiencing homelessness and to serve the most needy in our community. And I appreciate you considering this resolution [LOCATION]. [ORGANIZATION] urges you to extend the state of emergency.
02_21_2019,homeless; homelessness,"The flexibility that it allows has been invaluable to homeless providers around the region. One of the best examples of this is our FAC0, which you're likely familiar with. It provides safe sleeping pods with a locking door for women who have experienced long-term homelessness."
02_21_2019,homeless,"Some women have been homeless for [ORGANIZATION] and do not feel safe in shelters before they come into FAC0. We have placed 21 of these women into permanent housing over [LOCATION]. And I'm pleased to tell you the last three women from our original site have all been accepted into housing and will be moving into permanent housing in DATE2, which will bring our number up to 24."
02_21_2019,homeless,"We just announced it [TIME]. We're quite excited about it. And when we had our national site visit, we talked to them at length about the flexibility that we had received through the state of emergency, the work that we've done with the city and the county and the joint office and with all our homeless service providers."
02_21_2019,homelessness,"Prior to managing FAC0, I've also had the opportunity to work at almost every shelter authorized under the state of emergency. [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, [PERSON], FAC1, [PERSON], FAC2, and now FAC0. Each night I see firsthand the value of shelter services for folks struggling to regain stability and their homelessness and move forward with their lives."
02_21_2019,homelessness; affordable housing,"I'm therefore here [ORGANIZATION] to urge that the state of emergency be extended so that our community can further strengthen our shelter services and ensure that they link up more efficiently to the one thing that truly ends someone's homelessness, housing, affordable housing. Over DATE1, the state of emergency has allowed transition projects to significantly expand emergency shelter options in our community. And at present, more than 700 men, women, and couples shelter with us [TIME] across our eight different locations."
02_21_2019,affordable housing,"They're filled with people who need deeply affordable housing, and many also need wraparound support services to be successful in that housing to begin with. So along those lines, [ORGANIZATION] is proud to be working with [PERSON], ORG2, and ORG3 to help develop [LOCATION], the low-income single adult housing project that will bring 72 units of innovative, deeply affordable housing to the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood in [ORGANIZATION] by [ORGANIZATION]. The continuation of the state of emergency is critical to ensuring that affordable housing developments like FAC0 move through the system as quickly as possible, and that we are able to make progress on this community's commitment to permanent supportive housing."
02_21_2019,affordable housing,"We have recently taken over the operations at [ORGANIZATION], which is 50 units of supported housing for veterans in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood. We were also just awarded funding by [ORGANIZATION] to develop a new affordable housing project, which includes a mixture of one-bedroom apartments and [ORGANIZATION] units on a piece of church land that will focus on housing and supporting veterans. While we've made a lot of progress serving veterans in our community,  ORG1 shelters operate with a wait list because we're full [TIME]."
02_21_2019,homelessness; affordable housing,"And there are more than 400 veterans in the city of [ORGANIZATION] who we know are in need of permanent housing. The crisis for our veterans experiencing homelessness is not over. In the country they enlisted to protect, we can honor their service by ensuring they have access to basic emergency shelters and, more importantly, quality affordable housing."
02_21_2019,affordable housing,"By defending this country, veterans have invested in creating a [STREET] that ensures basic human rights, perhaps none more important than affordable housing for themselves and for the people that they served. Thank you for your time. Thank you."
02_21_2019,homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION] also provides on-site organizational and services support to ORG1. The funding that came through the state of emergency helped us meet some of the growing need that we see on the streets and in alternative shelter sites, and critically has helped to expand the reach of three culturally specific organizations, ORG2, [PERSON], and [LOCATION]. Their work with communities that are significantly overrepresented in the population experiencing homelessness is so important in addressing disparities and outcomes for these communities."
02_21_2019,homelessness,"Thank you. Along with our other in-reach partners, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and the ORG2, as well as [PERSON]'s outreach team, hundreds of people make the transition from homelessness to permanent housing [ORGANIZATION]. We know that traditional shelter doesn't work for everyone, and groups like [LOCATION] and [ORGANIZATION] have organized in response to the need for more safe spaces to rest at [TIME] and more options to find consistency, stability, and community—  We should support the efforts of people experiencing homelessness to organize and create alternative options."
02_21_2019,homeless; homelessness; affordable housing,"We encourage the city to take whatever steps it can during a continued state of emergency to support the efforts of the homeless community to explore alternative shelter opportunities and to facilitate the creation of deeply affordable housing, especially supportive housing. We know that when we make the right resources available to people, they are successful in ending their homelessness. A continued state of emergency would help make those tools available."
02_21_2019,homeless; homelessness,"So you focused on the need to provide housing for 400 veterans who continue to be homeless. Under the [PERSON] administration, when President [PERSON] made a commitment to end homelessness among our veterans, we had a superb tool called the VASH voucher, which allowed us to provide services and housing for our veterans. How are we doing under this administration in terms of getting VASH vouchers?"
02_21_2019,homeless; affordable housing,"And again, I commend the thinking behind it to spread these shelters out, farther out, in different locations to give the people the ability to stay in maybe the neighborhoods they're homeless in. And I think that's really been effective. From my opinion on the affordable housing bond,  That's been the best thing that's ever happened to this city."
02_21_2019,homeless,"There's no reason why these investors can't begin to commit those units before they do their stadium, before they do anything else. I'd like to see them commit to more of the 0% to 30% units, supportive housing, start bringing in money from [ORGANIZATION], other locations, and show that you're also here to take care of the homeless even if that stadium doesn't happen. Build those 8,000 units."
02_21_2019,homeless; homelessness; housing crisis,"So I appreciate the specific directives in this ordinance to make sure we're permanently changing the [STREET] we address housing and homelessness beyond the parameters of a temporary housing crisis. Myself and my office have been working pretty much nonstop on these issues since [ORGANIZATION] we arrived in FAC0. In addition to our work around tenant protections, I also co-chair [ORGANIZATION]."
02_21_2019,affordable housing,"This is a program that's worked really well in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], and has resulted in considerable investment in permanent affordable housing and home ownership opportunities for low-income households. However, without financial assistance for low-income renters to purchase and rehabilitate the properties, it would be a mostly empty gesture that would fail to benefit the people we are trying to assist. Commissioner?"
02_21_2019,homelessness,"So number one, well, and I'm not even going to read them as amendments. This is what I want us to consider [ORGANIZATION] in moving forward. We don't have revenue sources specifically identified to fund solutions to homelessness, displacements, and housing affordability issues."
02_21_2019,homeless; housing crisis,"so many housing-related policies and programs cannot be implemented or expanded. It makes perfect sense to me that [ORGANIZATION], as we reconsider the housing state of emergency, that we'd be talking about how we're going to pay for all of these things. Funding for policies and programs such as tenant opportunity to purchase, universal eviction defense, rent subsidies, alternative shelter resources, hygiene resources, and stabilizing and expanding the funding for [ORGANIZATION] is critical to further our goals of minimizing the impacts of the housing crisis."
02_21_2019,homeless; homelessness,"If we simply fund [ORGANIZATION] at [ORGANIZATION] level, we may be in a situation where we actually have no money to carve up. And that's not sustainable, even though if I had to take one last dollar that was available, I would invest it in addressing homelessness and the crisis on our streets. That's not sustainable."
02_21_2019,homeless,"Almost coincidentally, every meeting I've had [ORGANIZATION] has been about substance abuse or mental health issues, other public health issues that are clearly impacting people on the streets. Yes. We are constantly looking for resources to address the homeless crisis, which I think most people would acknowledge is the issue."
02_21_2019,affordable housing,"And it's an important perspective, I think, to recall our past as we chart our path forward. There were cranes in the air [ORGANIZATION], but the only cranes in the air that I remember were for affordable housing development, which is actually pretty extraordinary because given the collapse of the tax credit market and given all the funding challenges, it's amazing that anything got built [ORGANIZATION]. But we did not have hotels and commercial buildings and market rate residential buildings going up on every [STREET] corner."
02_21_2019,affordable housing,"DATE0, we had affordable housing, maybe. And we were grateful in [LOCATION] for the [ORGANIZATION] stimulus money. And we were also grateful for an incredibly resilient community that was skilled, particularly our nonprofit partners, at weathering all the odds and getting product built."
02_21_2019,affordable housing,"The combination of the impacts of inclusionary housing, of focused and sustained investment of urban renewal resources and other resources in affordable housing development,  The commitment that we made to 2,000 new units of supportive housing, the reduced barriers to siting shelters, and the renewed conversation about asking every neighborhood to come forward with a creative [STREET] to do their fair share of addressing this crisis is bearing fruit. What we've learned is that this crisis is not over and will continue for some time. [ORGANIZATION]'s proposal is to extend the state of emergency for [LOCATION]."
02_21_2019,homeless,"And as [ORGANIZATION] pointed out, it's important that we bake into our code some of these changes to really get some efficiencies in how we do our development going forward. I have visited most of the [ORGANIZATION] cities that are dealing with the same crisis that we are dealing with. In [ORGANIZATION], the city of [ORGANIZATION] is spending literally billions of dollars to address this crisis, and yet per capita they have over two times the number of homeless individuals as we have in the city of [PERSON]."
02_21_2019,homelessness,"The city of [ORGANIZATION] is dealing with, on a much grander scale, this contradiction between being a city with an enormously productive economy, on the one hand, with high-tech millionaires being minted [ORGANIZATION], and a huge problem with homelessness and a lack of affordability. The city of [ORGANIZATION], which I visited recently, has a huge problem, and it seems, in my view, harsher. It seems harsher and more prevalent than the crisis that we're experiencing."
02_21_2019,affordable housing,"I want to also say that I guess I share Commissioner [PERSON]'s concern about whether or not we're moving. the goalposts. With all due respect to all the people who are working their hearts out to try to do the best they can with the limited resources that they have, the reality is even the term affordable housing is an oxymoron because I can't tell you what's affordable for you, just like you can't tell me what's affordable for me."
02_21_2019,affordable housing,"And we have a lot of housing that's posing as affordable housing that working people simply cannot afford to live in. And so we have to do a better job. We the city.  of really being able to identify really what does an affordable housing, what does a unit that people can afford to live in look like?"
02_21_2019,affordable housing,"PERSON0. Well, as you've heard [ORGANIZATION], there continues to be a shortage of workforce and affordable housing units in the city. There are, of course, stark disparities in economic prosperity, and that was highlighted by a report that was released [LOCATION] by [ORGANIZATION]."
02_21_2019,affordable housing,"And far too many people continue to live in unsheltered conditions on our streets. Thank you. During the state of housing emergency, we've been able to provide basic and emergency services expeditiously and fast-track affordable housing projects without compromising quality."
02_21_2019,affordable housing,"Since there continues to be an urgent need for services and shelter that cater to basic human needs, I believe it's imperative that we continue to support these services through this appropriate legislative solution. Given the dependency of these actions on a formal state of emergency, the current housing state of emergency should obviously be extended for [ORGANIZATION]. This extension from a practical sense gives us the means to continue to provide a necessary safety net where city boroughs begin work on more sustainable long-term solutions, including but not limited to the legislative proposals that would amend Title 33 under this code to allow for the permanent siting of day storage units.  expeditiously allowing for temporary housing in the issuance of permits related to shelter siting, and creating an expeditious process for design review of affordable housing projects."
02_21_2019,homeless,"And therefore, I support this ordinance. I also just want to be crystal clear, this ordinance is very narrow in its scope. This is one of many tools that [ORGANIZATION] has brought to bear to address both the housing issue as well as the homeless issue."
02_21_2019,homeless,"In addition to the great work that we're collectively doing with the county through [ORGANIZATION],  which is providing prevention services and important shelter services for those who are currently on the [STREET], including services around behavioral health or substance abuse.  and providing, of course, the transition into housing, we at the city have been working very hard. I've worked alongside my colleagues on reforms to both planning and zoning throughout the city to be able to increase the supply of units. We have been very busily reforming our permitting process."
02_21_2019,affordable housing,We've been expediting targeted affordable housing units. We've supported renter protections. We have developed a record number of workforce and affordable housing units through [ORGANIZATION].
02_21_2019,homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION] has operated housing programs and served the community for over [ORGANIZATION], and with recent expansions to our housing and homelessness outreach programs, we hope to meet the needs of community members. With this collaborative, we will all, as a part of the collaborative legal aid services, [ORGANIZATION], ORG2, and [ORGANIZATION] host a [LOCATION] meeting and staff each case. Each client who accesses this collaborative will have access to an attorney and legal representation if discrimination is founded and legal action is recommended."
02_21_2019,housing crisis,"And so we are in a housing crisis. It is really, really difficult for working people to find a house that they can afford to live in. Right."
02_21_2019,affordable housing,"Thank you. So, you know, I think it is a broader [STREET] of addressing one facet of the problem. And I know truly, yes, we have access issues and we need more affordable housing, but we need to make sure that people are actually having the opportunity to get in that housing."
02_21_2019,housing crisis,"You know, the results of the audit testing showed how far reaching discrimination is in our rental market for black and [ORGANIZATION] renters. The results didn't come as a surprise to us, as we know racism in the rental market, both overt and subtle, is pervasive. We also know that the housing crisis is not just one of affordability but of racialized gentrification."
02_21_2019,affordable housing,"What I also want to discuss, because we talked about housing, as some of you as commissioners know, I'm on [ORGANIZATION]. What I really, truly appreciate about this discussion is that when you think about affordable housing, we all know that the construction costs are skyrocketing. And I can remember as a construction manager, we had to make decisions based on are we putting solar and weatherization on this project and can we make it penciled?"
02_21_2019,homeless; homelessness; affordable housing,"This fund has the opportunity to help subsidize some of these projects to ensure that the tenants and the owners can benefit from these savings and from the affordable housing that's being produced. We also talked in the last segment about homeless housing. This is the opportunity for some of those folks facing homelessness, facing the rising housing rents, to not only be able to live in their city, but to be able to have the income levels to sustain living wherever they choose."
01_02_2019,homeless,"And I think that, you know, [ORGANIZATION] is a perfect example of that. She has been instrumental in signing bills to kill off the homeless, like greenlighting the [ORGANIZATION] sweeping of homeless camps, the removal of our – yeah,"
01_02_2019,homeless,"you did, you voted, and it was in a unanimous vote. You voted on that, right?  Wasn't it yes vote? And the removal of homeless so-called zombie RVs, which are killing lots of older disabled homeless people."
01_02_2019,houseless,"And I want us to be careful that we have some kind of criteria for who's on it. I don't want just to have...  since we have so many percentage of people being a certain [STREET], that we have someone who's a token who is not representing the needs, and that just because someone is houseless doesn't mean they don't have really strong, legitimate contributions and legitimacy that we need to hear from. Hear, hear."
02_05_2020,homelessness,"Based on the [ORGANIZATION] assessment data from [ORGANIZATION], about 45% of all third graders in [ORGANIZATION] public schools weren't meeting state reading benchmarks. For students of color, students learning English, and those experiencing poverty or homelessness, the numbers are far more bleak. This is not acceptable and our community can and needs to help solve these issues."
02_05_2020,affordable housing,"I very much appreciate the discussion [ORGANIZATION] and the conversation that Commissioner [PERSON] and I had [LOCATION]. For DATE2, I've been the most I'm an active member of council and looking after people who live outside and trying to find creative solutions for them. I worked for [ORGANIZATION] to move Right to Dream 2 from FAC0 to their current location and I've constantly been looking out for how can we be more helpful to people living outside while at the same time we stress the need for permanent affordable housing."
02_05_2020,affordable housing,"My concerns still remain that as a city, we own property that we then sell, and then we say that the biggest cost, the biggest barrier to building affordable housing is land. and we sell the land and then we go out and we buy more expensive land somewhere else."
02_05_2020,affordable housing,More than 50% of all housing built in [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION] is on the streetcar line. And nearly 40% of all subsidized affordable housing is on the streetcar line. This is all part of a plan.
02_05_2020,affordable housing,"Like other transit systems, the people who live along the streetcar line are the ones using it. Our census demographics are one to one in terms of who rides the streetcar and who lives along it. So those investments in affordable housing or just generally jobs or institutions, those are paying dividends in terms of our ridership."
02_05_2020,affordable housing,"This is a land use planning grant that's being administered by [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and ORG2, looking at potential streetcar expansions in northwest [ORGANIZATION] to [PERSON], as well as potential routes on the east side to GPE2. And that work is being managed largely by [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], looking at potential land use changes and the investments in transit and transportation that would have to go along with that. And thinking about what outcomes we can achieve in terms of affordable housing and affordable office as we're building out the city with a streetcar line."
02_05_2020,affordable housing,"And then my second question is, we just celebrated the opening of [ORGANIZATION], which is an affordable housing development along the streetcar line on the east side. Are there more opportunities on the again on the existing system for large-scale development either for affordable housing or economic development? Yeah certainly there's if you think about where the streetcar runs there all of your key development opportunities within the central city are on the streetcar line."
02_14_2018,homelessness,"Item 134, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding homelessness and hygiene access. Good morning. Good morning."
02_14_2018,homeless,"It is nearly impossible for an individual raised in our society to be healthy mentally, emotionally, or physically without sufficient access to hygiene. The false image of someone who is homeless as a dirty bum, unworthy of consideration as a human being, is reinforced by denying basic human services. It is impossible to convey what it feels like to walk down the sidewalk and have nearly everyone I see look at me with contempt, fear, and anger, or worse, make an effort to not acknowledge my existence at all."
02_14_2018,homelessness,"The current policy of trying to clean up the problem of homelessness by sweeps will never work. Pushing people from one [STREET] to another with a stick may temporarily make some sidewalks and mostly more affluent neighborhoods look cleaner. But ultimately, sweeps can never clean anything because people aren't garbage."
02_14_2018,houseless,"And I wound up covering things across the world from [ORGANIZATION] to my latest one, I think on [ORGANIZATION], who was a houseless individual sleeping in a tent and explaining to me what that was like and how he did it and why he didn't come to the city and why he didn't go to shelters. I give the example many times of I tried to cover stories, both interviews and speakers and events with [ORGANIZATION], as well as other projects where I would be a camera operator or audio or lighting with someone else's project to cover things that ORG1 didn't cover. Our network affiliates in town here didn't cover it."
02_10_2016,affordable housing,"Commissioner [PERSON]. Thank you, Mr. President. [ORGANIZATION] is [LOCATION] as we move forward to approve the development of a new 106-unit affordable housing development in close-in southeast [ORGANIZATION]."
02_10_2016,homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION] is co-sponsored by [ORGANIZATION] and ORG2, I hope I pronounced that correctly, the nonprofit housing development arm of [ORGANIZATION]. The development will focus a portion of its housing on families at risk of homelessness and fleeing domestic violence. The development is on the city block located at [ORGANIZATION] and FAC1 on land formerly owned by the Catholic parish of FAC2, the former site of [PERSON], a parish that is well known for its commitment to the less fortunate of our city through its DATE0 feeding program,  And most recently, they stepped up when the community needed them to provide emergency shelter during severe DATE1 weather."
02_10_2016,affordable housing,"we're very excited about being able to introduce 106 units of affordable housing in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood. As Commissioner [PERSON] has said, this is a great inner-city neighborhood. There's a lot going on."
02_10_2016,affordable housing,"If you've driven around this neighborhood, you've seen a lot of new construction projects. All of them, I believe, are at market rate. There is not a lot, if any, other development of affordable housing occurring in this neighborhood."
02_10_2016,affordable housing,"I also want to acknowledge [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]. As was said before, [ORGANIZATION] made a difficult decision to sell this land to us at a rate that was less than they could have received, at a price less than they could have received, if they sold it to any other developer in town. They could have received more money for their parish, but they chose to sell it to us at a price that would make our project work and would allow for affordable housing to be built on this project."
02_10_2016,homelessness,"It will establish units for people who work in the inner east side area, people moving out of homelessness, and people escaping domestic violence. The project is based on the core standards that we have in [ORGANIZATION], the dignity and respect of the individuals we serve. There will be on-site case management services for many of the clients."
02_10_2016,homeless,"It's an important social justice statement in this neighborhood as it arises out of what has become a sanctuary park for homeless individuals [ORGANIZATION]. And before that, a neighborhood and school park to now stand against the forces of gentrification and high pricing that none of our clients could afford. Our partnership with [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], with the ORG2 is really just a remarkable set of opportunities."
02_10_2016,affordable housing,"Ms. [PERSON], add a few words? I'm the pastor leader of [ORGANIZATION], and I also want to offer my gratitude for the funding the city is putting into this project. [ORGANIZATION] Parish actually has been aware of a lack of affordable housing and workforce housing in the city for quite a while, and we've been actually working for [ORGANIZATION] to find the right partners to build a project that the parish felt good about in our neighborhood."
02_10_2016,affordable housing,"We're, like many, like all affordable housing projects [ORGANIZATION], it's complex to put the project together. The city funding is one of 10 sources of financing in the project. Some of the other parties that are providing loans or grants or equity, investors' equity, are [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2."
02_10_2016,homelessness,And so we should acknowledge that  commissioner [ORGANIZATION] pioneered that idea and i think it's now the right arrangement where we're not in the business of lose but someone else is and they're doing quite well the third comment i want to make is that we had a work session DATE0 about the mayor's proposal for camping and how we're going to address homelessness and those details are still being worked out but one of the things that i think struck all of us is that we have a crisis that we've identified on our streets And we have to have a housing strategy that ensures a [STREET] for people who've been on our streets to go.
02_10_2016,homelessness,so i really compliment you for that and the other thing that jumped out at me on the pro forma and i was going to ask [ORGANIZATION] just to elaborate on this it says that there'll be 25 units set aside for at-risk households and you'll be putting project-based section 8 vouchers so for for for the average person watching that could you tell us what that means  Sure. So there are 25 units that will be set aside for a combination of women who are escaping domestic violence or women who are in or at risk of homelessness. So we have units that are set aside for them.
02_10_2016,homeless; affordable housing,This project has nothing to do with the homeless. Affordable housing is a scam. It's 60% of the going rate here.
02_10_2016,homeless,"That's $65,000. 60% of that is $40,000. That has nothing to do with the homeless."
02_10_2016,homeless,"So, Mr. [PERSON], don't you dare use the homeless to justify this mess. Thank you. Thanks, [PERSON]."
02_10_2016,affordable housing,"Everything looks good as far as on the numbers. And again, as Mr. [PERSON] has stated, the term affordable housing units, current MFI, is always under debate and always can be changed. Again, my position is if you want to lower rents and offer housing, you build more housing."
02_10_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"Keep them building if you want to decrease homelessness. Do not impede the developers. And when we're talking about the fossil fuel industry extraction companies...  begin to stop their subsidies and begin to understand, don't fund everything over to the solar systems and those directions, but also fund a percentage to the affordable housing industries as subsidies to keep the developers building more units."
02_10_2016,affordable housing,"We have a tremendous amount of subsidies out there that need to start being directed in affordable housing, creating more jobs, more housing, and will shut the fossil fuel industries down. That's what needs to be done. This type of loan here, again, if these facts are true by Mr. [PERSON], do not fund this money if your socially and morally responsible policy within this city has any meaning and any bearing."
02_10_2016,homeless,"Unfortunately, the [STREET] our economy works out, there's no longer a school associated with that location. But I've visited with the people of [ORGANIZATION] in worship. And if any community is working hard to increase protection of vulnerable people, be they children or the homeless in this community, it is [PERSON]."
02_10_2016,affordable housing,"So it's good that this is getting attention, especially to promote the healing of those victims that are covered related to that bankruptcy and settlement. But we obviously need much more than 100, 106 units of affordable housing. We need more projects where a higher percentage is for the 30 and below."
02_10_2016,homeless,"You have [TIME]. My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I'm a homeless guy, or formerly, recently homeless guy."
02_10_2016,homeless,"But there are rooms, and they got locks, and there's homeless people that need them, and I'm glad you're doing what you're doing. Thank you. Thank you very much, sir."
02_10_2016,affordable housing,"Hi. PERSON0? Well, I want to thank [ORGANIZATION] for providing this land for this important affordable housing project.  and remind people of the fact that they did sell it to [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] at a very favorable rate and under very fair terms."
02_10_2016,affordable housing,"And this is, as I said, 106 units of affordable housing, 10 of those units deeply affordable, and helping victims of domestic violence. These are all the types of attributes that we should be supporting as a city, and I'm proud to vote aye. No, thank you."
02_10_2016,affordable housing,"I echo what my colleagues have said. I appreciate Commissioner [PERSON] pointing out that from the city's perspective, when we've been struggling with what people have called the high cost of affordable housing, this is a bargain. I appreciate everyone's work."
02_10_2016,affordable housing,"The proclamation referred to the 11 by 13 preservation campaign, which was led by Commissioner [PERSON]. One notable event which I want to share among all those great accomplishments was in [ORGANIZATION], a waiver was approved by [ORGANIZATION] headquarters for the use of $7 million of [ORGANIZATION] residual receipts for construction costs for some 11 of these projects. This was accomplished through communication, cooperation, and shared affordable housing goals of ORG1, ORG2, [PERSON], and [LOCATION]."
02_10_2016,affordable housing,"Again, it's a partnership, cooperation. It takes many hands to get this work done. I want to mention briefly the ORG0 multifamily still remains committed to affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION] and in [PERSON]."
02_10_2016,affordable housing,"Significantly on [ORGANIZATION], the ORG0 initial closing of [ORGANIZATION]'s FAC0 was accomplished through, again, communication and cooperation among many affordable housing partners in the state and the city, But we especially want to note that [PERSON] was instrumental in facilitating the issuance of the building permits for [ORGANIZATION]'s FAC0 by ORG2. [ORGANIZATION] FAC0 is under construction now as a substantial rehab project."
02_10_2016,affordable housing,"In conclusion, [ORGANIZATION] has had a significant impact in terms of affordability and access to capital for developers and lenders for the city of [ORGANIZATION] and for communities throughout [PERSON]. I want to thank the multifamily staff  who through their passion for affordable housing, their problem-solving skills, and commitment to both the mission and market goals of ORG1, made all these accomplishments possible. Finally, again, I appreciate the opportunity to share these remarks and for the proclamation DATE0."
02_10_2016,affordable housing,And I have to tell you that the ORG0 multifamily team here in [ORGANIZATION] is absolutely one of the best. [ORGANIZATION] and the state of [ORGANIZATION] has benefited from their tremendous work and tireless commitment to affordable housing and urban development over [ORGANIZATION]. We have been very lucky to benefit from all of their expertise and efforts.
02_10_2016,homeless,"The activities of public housing authorities, the Section 8 voucher program, [ORGANIZATION] program, the [ORGANIZATION] program, and we enforce the Fair Housing Act. We partner with you on homeless programs. Many of the programs, in fact, that you were just discussing in the prior agenda item contributing to the ongoing development work that you all are moving forward with."
02_10_2016,affordable housing,"I'll be happy to read the proclamation. Whereas [ORGANIZATION]'s affordable housing community has enjoyed a long and productive relationship with our federal partners from [ORGANIZATION], or [ORGANIZATION], and whereas in [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] created ORG2 and opened a local office in downtown [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION],  Whereas [ORGANIZATION], like every other city in [PERSON], cannot be successful without a strong partnership with [ORGANIZATION] and federal investments in affordable housing. And whereas in [DATE], the GPE2 office provided multifamily loans, direct loans, and grants to 342 properties and almost 23,000 affordable apartments in [ORGANIZATION]."
02_10_2016,homelessness,"Yes, FAC0. All right, let's call FAC0, please. Amend contract with transition projects to add $450,000 for the operation of a [ORGANIZATION] emergency shelter for men experiencing homelessness."
02_10_2016,homeless,"Oh, thank you. I'm [PERSON]. I'm [PERSON] Manager at [ORGANIZATION]."
02_10_2016,affordable housing,"Again, do the analysis as [ORGANIZATION] has stated on a pilot program to begin with, 100 people, budgeted at $750,000 on an [ORGANIZATION] basis, and bring in transitional projects to begin the process moving forward. Again, we've looked at the...  statements made out of [ORGANIZATION] by Mr. [PERSON]. Again, his emphasis is on more shelter space, more permanent affordable housing being built, not tent cities, not that I'm against tent cities, but his emphasis is more on shelter space, transitioning space, and that's what we have here."
02_10_2016,homeless,"Commissioner [PERSON] has been down at the legislature a lot recently, trying to get the exclusion on inclusionary housing repealed by the state legislature, and he's working very diligently on that. We are working on a number of different fronts. There is not a finite number of people who become homeless, whether all of the veterans who were outside in [ORGANIZATION] are now inside,  Or not, there are others who have become homeless, that still a medical emergency or loss of a job or other reasons cause people to lose their housing."
02_10_2016,affordable housing,"And we know that there isn't enough affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION] for people with full-time jobs. So that's the reality that we are in, and the [ORGANIZATION] is just as frustrated as everyone in the community that we don't have the resources to fix it. I encourage everybody to participate in the budget process."
02_10_2016,affordable housing,"If you think there's a magic bucket of money somewhere, please help us find it, because we would like to put it to a vote.  to affordable housing. We have already dedicated $6.2 million of ongoing funding in the upcoming budget to additional assistance and we're going to be looking for more. We have other needs that we need to fund too."
02_10_2016,houseless,"No, thank you. I, too, would like to thank the [PERSON] family for this extraordinary act of civic leadership, which I think –  Commissioner [PERSON] suggested is going to inspire others in the community with resources to step up and help deal with the houseless issue. And I really appreciate the quick work of [LOCATION] and the rest of [ORGANIZATION] and the transition projects and of Commissioner [PERSON]'s office to bring this to fruition, as Commissioner [PERSON] just said, in a very short period of time."
02_10_2016,homeless,"Authorize a competitive solicitation for the provision of treatment readiness services, transitional housing, and follow-up retention support services to chemically dependent homeless adult chronic arrestees. Who is here from [ORGANIZATION] to present on this? Pardon me?"
02_10_2016,affordable housing,"I've been working closely with our excellent government relations team and the sponsor of [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON], Senator [PERSON], to assist in moving this legislation forward in [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION], Senator [PERSON] and myself had a meeting with local developers to learn of their concerns about the implementation of inclusionary housing. Many developers in the community are supportive of the efforts to remove the ban, but they do have concerns about the implementation of such a policy, how we engage the development community in that process, and that we consider the impact of all impending changes that we have on the table regarding affordable housing that affect the development community."
02_10_2016,affordable housing,"That includes our floor area ratio bonus incentive bonus program in the comp plan for affordable housing and also a proposed linkage fee for affordable housing. This resolution simply asserts our commitment as a city council that during any consideration of an inclusionary housing policy, we would engage in a community-wide, data-driven discussion that would include the development community as well as affordable housing experts and advocates. Further, that a panel of housing experts with representation from the development community would be expected to advise the council throughout the discussion of an inclusionary housing ordinance."
02_10_2016,affordable housing,"My heart slightly sinks thinking about how much energy has gone into fighting this proposal, particularly in [TIME]. I appreciate the passion and creativity, but would much rather see our neighborhood up in arms about affordable housing, something that would directly combat displacement in [ORGANIZATION]. This development is positioned in the [ORGANIZATION] and could qualify for the new multi-program at [ORGANIZATION]."
02_10_2016,affordable housing,"If you as a council are going to push back or leverage this vacation for additional community benefits,  I would urge you to put affordable housing at the top of that agenda. Commissioner [PERSON]'s eyes light up. Thank you very much."
02_10_2016,affordable housing,"Some of it is due to the lack of affordable housing that FAC0 calls for. This development does not indicate any affordable housing. Additionally, the claim of safety at the [ORGANIZATION] and FAC1 intersection  may be valid, but in my opinion, it's short-sighted."
02_03_2016,homeless,"I'm a founding member of [ORGANIZATION] and also the founder of [ORGANIZATION]. DATE0 I've come in front of you guys to discuss some matters. You guys supposedly have a homeless state of emergency in this town, yet people like me who go out and document the ongoing sweeps  are actually falsely being charged with interference just for simply documenting these sweeps that are ongoing."
02_03_2016,homeless,"On [ORGANIZATION], I received charges of interference, and it looks like Officer PERSON0 and the other officers involved in this sweep that happened right across from PERSON1 common gave out... For other people that were homeless campers, similar charges. I'm not going to name their names out of respect for them, but I could provide you with documents of all this."
02_03_2016,homeless,"You guys still haven't released the full surveillance footage to my lawyers, which shows that I didn't touch your little G4S security goon, that he actually touched me and tackled me unprovoked when I was doing nothing but filming. So you guys are criminally charging journalists  and beating up mentally ill men. And one of these homeless people that got these charges is actually a schizophrenic."
02_03_2016,homeless,"So that's a real good job you guys are doing for this homeless state of emergency. And, you know, there is a [ORGANIZATION] settlement against the city, you know. Maybe you guys might want to actually start."
02_03_2016,affordable housing,"And I wish we had a more robust tool.  to preserve that particular class of affordable housing in our community because in this current market, it's particularly vulnerable. We just don't have a great tool. But congratulations."
02_03_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,"A half million dollars is an important amount of money for FAC0, or whatever we named the park in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood. But a half million dollars in a city that, as Commissioner [PERSON] noted, is having a housing crisis, is losing low-income affordable housing, is not a significant money. A half million dollars...  is only the payroll for five of the 40 city attorneys."
02_03_2016,affordable housing,"But they do have some concerns about the implementation of such a policy by cities if that ban is lifted. And in particular, with respect to [ORGANIZATION], there are concerns about how we will engage the development community in the process and that we consider the impact of the impending changes that we have on the table in a holistic manner, that we look at issues around linkage fees, around FAR bonus incentives, as well as inclusionary housing, and that we consider those all together. And so we have a resolution here that is in response to a request by Senator [PERSON] to put [ORGANIZATION] on the record that during any consideration by the city of inclusionary housing, that we would engage in a community-wide data-driven discussion that would include the development community as well as affordable housing experts and advocates, and further, that a panel of housing experts...  with representation from the development community, would be expected to advise the council throughout the discussion of an inclusionary housing ordinance."
02_03_2016,affordable housing,"As a result, it is increasingly difficult for working families  to live in neighborhoods close to their employment and where their children attend school, whereas an inclusionary housing ordinance would provide an affordable housing tool that links the production of affordable housing to the production of market-rate housing. Inclusionary housing policies reduce affordable housing by requiring new residential developments to include a certain percentage of affordable housing units, whereas if the legislature were to lift the preemption on inclusionary housing,  in [ORGANIZATION] session, it would allow [ORGANIZATION] to comprehensively consider the use of the tool, while it also considers its comprehensive plan, incentive zoning, and linkage fee proposal. Now, therefore, be it resolved, if ORG1 lifts the statewide preemption on inclusionary housing ordinances, [ORGANIZATION] would consider the use of an inclusionary housing ordinance to create affordable housing  within new market rate residential developments and be it further resolved during the consideration of any inclusionary housing ordinance, [ORGANIZATION] would engage in a community-wide data-driven discussion that would include but would not be limited to members of the development community as well as affordable housing experts and advocates."
02_03_2016,affordable housing,"and to see this committee come together to formulate and to come up with preference policy and other important ideas to help bring this to pass and even obtain additional funds to support the programs has been a dream come true. And I've learned quite a bit, and I'm still learning as a part of this committee, what it takes to have a city involved and what it takes to help people that are in need, and especially with affordable housing. It's one of the things that has caused a lot of cities in this country to...  fall apart and to cause problems in the city."
02_03_2016,affordable housing,"But I believe [PERSON] is taking the right initiative in getting a group like this oversight committee together, people that are knowledgeable and even people such as myself that I'm learning about the process to be able to participate and do something in a positive [STREET] to help improve things for this city. I think this is a great city and it can  have a good legacy by participating as it is participating now and continues to participate and support and to be able to bring back affordable housing so people can indeed live in the city, they can work in the city where their jobs are, children can be educated in their communities and back into the schools and see some benefits  wonderful things happen for our community residents. I was looking recently at [ORGANIZATION], who has done a wonderful job in graduating students."
02_03_2016,affordable housing,"So some of these are our own next steps and other sort of expectations that we have for what we'll be hearing about and learning about. First, in land banking, our report to the [ORGANIZATION] and our expectation from the [ORGANIZATION] is to see a plan and a strategy developed and to have our oversight function as we move into land banking. Land banking was added as part of this $20 million allocation because of our recognition, many community-based organizations and housing organizations' recognition of the top speed at which the market is moving, that it's really critical to take land off the market now so that it can be used in combination with other subsidies to develop affordable housing."
02_03_2016,affordable housing,"I could spend [TIME], I got [TIME] here, I could spend [TIME] talking about this stuff. There's a lot of bad stuff going on in our country and people aren't even talking about it. When it comes to affordable housing, that's my background."
02_03_2016,affordable housing,"Now, if it can't work, I want them to tell me why it can't. Listen, when it comes to affordable housing, let me tell you something about affordable housing. I've got [TIME]."
02_03_2016,affordable housing,"I've got [TIME]. I'll give you [TIME]. There's five things you need to build affordable housing, five."
02_03_2016,affordable housing,"that is specifically for that purpose. [ORGANIZATION] has a land banking fund that they have not, [ORGANIZATION] have not been utilized to a great extent. As you recall, [ORGANIZATION] is a nonprofit affordable housing lender for the state."
02_03_2016,affordable housing,"We stand ready to mobilize all the resources available to us. The idea of using [ORGANIZATION] as the intermediary is actually much more nimble, much more agile. It's flexible.  2% money for [ORGANIZATION], so it's interest only on the loan balance for a DATE1 period of time, with the idea being that it would not be a long-term hold."
02_03_2016,affordable housing,"As I look around this chamber, there are so many stalwarts of affordable housing and of champions from [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]east [LOCATION] in the room here, all here maybe to listen, maybe just to support, but all deeply engaged in this process. And that's what it takes to come up with a plan that begins to correct some of the wrongs of the past. And I'm very, very impressed."
02_03_2016,affordable housing,"As I said, I will look  to duplicating this in [ORGANIZATION] and perhaps in some of our other projects. It's probably a little early to declare success yet, but it's certainly an amazing start, and I am very pleased that you took the time to come to give a detailed report to council and all the community support  We do have many challenges for affordable housing, for home ownership, for displacement, a wide range of housing challenges, which certainly [ORGANIZATION] that I've been on the council, we've tripled the housing budget. We have done...  what we thought we could, the most we thought we could do at the time."
02_03_2016,affordable housing,"And for that, I'm grateful, [ORGANIZATION], to you and the committee. thank you [PERSON] and mayor [PERSON] thank you director PERSON3 who in his short stint here has really made a difference i'm pleased to accept the report aye well i also wanted to recognize mayor [PERSON] because he was really the the genesis for the whole notion of dedicating 20 million dollars in additional urban renewal dollars specifically to go towards affordable housing production and anti-displacement activities"
02_03_2016,affordable housing,"So thank you, Mayor [PERSON]. I want to also thank the members of [ORGANIZATION], who we've entrusted with coming up with the policies and the programs to make this real, to increase affordable housing production in the [ORGANIZATION] area, to provide anti-displacement activities and funding, and to look at things like a preference policy to provide people the ability to move  live or live again in the [ORGANIZATION] [LOCATION] area. I want to recognize many key staff who have and [PERSON], thank you for your capable leadership from [ORGANIZATION] of [ORGANIZATION] and to all the committee members."
01_08_2020,homelessness,"And I thank PERSON0 and [ORGANIZATION] and PERSON2 for letting us have so much of PERSON3. People don't realise that when you're on the council, you're just on all the time. You go to the grocery store at [TIME] at [TIME] trying to get your family a jug of milk and somebody's right there telling you, could you please do something about homelessness?"
01_08_2020,affordable housing,"I think a lot about the impact of the work we do now on future generations, about how [ORGANIZATION], when we are largely forgotten, our invisible fingerprints will still be left all over the city. Commissioner [PERSON] made some of his finest marks in affordable housing, environmental services, parks, and the cleanup and restoration of our waterways. But my personal debt of gratitude to [PERSON] is that he welcomed me in and insisted i take my [STREET] not as an outsider but as an integral part of something much bigger and more important than ourselves or our differences it was an honor to serve on this council with him he brought such valuable knowledge and history equanimity humor civility and an endless willingness to find the reasonable amicable compromise as our unofficial mediator and middle child of the council."
01_08_2020,homeless; homelessness,"So we'll take that as a compliment. [ORGANIZATION], this is a unique program that we helped establish in [ORGANIZATION]. It provides accessibility to soccer for homeless youth or those in danger of homelessness."
01_08_2020,homeless,"There is a potential we'd love to host a regional national homeless [STREET] soccer event in the future because of the success of this chapter. This was started in [ORGANIZATION]. We saw it and brought it to the attention of the soccer community here and helped launch this nonprofit, get them going."
01_08_2020,homeless,"I don't see homeless people, they collect all the plastic bottles. I don't see, they eat food waste out of the garbage. They eat leftovers."
01_08_2020,homelessness,"I have a request. hear the presentation first because I will continue to enforce the rules and there's people in this chamber who I really would like to hear the full conversation and the full discussion. So with that, colleagues, I think everybody here understands that homelessness is a humanitarian problem."
01_08_2020,homelessness,"So, I was in my very early introductory remarks on item number 15. Homelessness in [ORGANIZATION], I'm sure we all agree, is a humanitarian crisis. I think we can also agree that camp cleanups are difficult but necessary work to sustain and improve the safety and livability of our city."
01_08_2020,homelessness,The staff of rapid response can offer us these intangibles. 63% of their employees have experienced the criminal justice system firsthand. 59% have experienced homelessness firsthand.
01_08_2020,homelessness,"Thank you. My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I'm the manager of the City's [ORGANIZATION]. PERSON1, can you slide that just a little bit closer?"
01_08_2020,homelessness,"Good morning. My name is [ORGANIZATION] and I'm a program coordinator with [ORGANIZATION], or ORG1 by our better known acronym. But we are the group responsible for administering the One Point of Contact campsite reporting system."
01_08_2020,homelessness,"Individuals need to only pick one. PERSON0, our group, a team of three, we receive anywhere from 800 to 1,200 reports a week surrounding issues of homelessness. This is our campsite report form for folks that are not familiar."
01_08_2020,homeless,"But typically, our first responder is a group called [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] is a homeless to work program through ORG1. They respond by going to the reported location and conducting an assessment on behalf of the city."
01_08_2020,unhoused,"It is our intent to be as transparent as possible with everyone in the community, both housed and unhoused, so that folks know what we are doing and when. In [ORGANIZATION], 15% of all sites assessed by [ORGANIZATION] were posted for cleanup. That means out of all the sites [ORGANIZATION] went to assess, only 15% met our posting thresholds and were actually posted."
01_08_2020,houseless,"So if you're thinking about you do X number total, right, of cleanups, how many of them actually end up displacing people who are houseless? Do you know, like, can you tell me what the percentage is or what the real numbers are? Sure."
01_08_2020,homelessness,So this is our group's performance measures. Folks can find this also on our website in more detail for those that are interested. Our group is not designed to solve homelessness.
01_08_2020,homeless,"Thank you, [ORGANIZATION]. That was great. And again, my name is [PERSON], and I manage this homeless and suburban camping and act reduction program."
01_08_2020,houseless,"I want to make sure that for the record, the public knows that the plan is that you will have to come back to [ORGANIZATION] before there is any extension of this contract, that we will have community conversations with frontline community members to make sure that they are their feedback is incorporated into whatever the next steps are and that number three that we will have a city council work session with invited testimony before any additional contracting is done with this one contract. I want to also encourage the folks that are working on the [STREET] to actually really engage with those community members who are frontline workers with houseless community members and help develop opportunities for them to be employed to be able to help with these cleanups as well. right?"
01_08_2020,homelessness,"Well, I want to thank our community partners, especially [ORGANIZATION] for bringing their concerns to our attention and for being patient with us as we work to improve and move this work forward. I've been working on homelessness issues since I first arrived in [ORGANIZATION]. My office facilitated multiple meetings between community advocates, the mayor's office, and ORG2."
01_08_2020,homelessness,PERSON0. I want to hone in on something [PERSON] said during his presentation. This is not our strategy to end homelessness.
01_08_2020,homelessness,"And I want to appreciate the hard work you've put into it. And we will continue to work on our primary strategies, which are compassionate and effective to address homelessness, whether it's prevention. DATE0, through the joint office in a home for everyone, 7,000 people received prevention services in this community, people who are at high risk of becoming homelessness."
01_08_2020,homeless,"DATE0, over 6,000 people were homeless. moved either from the streets or from shelter into housing. 35,000 people in this community received other services, whether it was prevention, shelter, access to services, or transitioned into housing."
01_08_2020,affordable housing,"We work through the housing bureau on affordable housing. So there's many things that we are doing, and I want to acknowledge something Commissioner [PERSON] might have mentioned if you were here [ORGANIZATION]. Which is we have pursued a very aggressive set of goals around permanent supportive housing."
01_08_2020,homeless,"To address those who are chronically homeless, those who have the greatest health needs. to help them get off the [STREET]. We committed to 2,000 units of permanent supportive housing in this community over [ORGANIZATION]."
01_08_2020,houseless,"Whereas all people living in or visiting [ORGANIZATION] do not have equal access to the protection and benefits of the urban tree canopy, which impacts their ability to breathe healthy air, exercise, stay cool, and pursue happiness. These people include children, houseless, elderly, and those living in low-income areas. Be it further resolved that the city takes specific steps to meet with the most impacted communities in decisions made regarding tree preservation."
01_08_2020,houseless,"Whereas all people living in or visiting [ORGANIZATION] do not have equal access to the protection and benefits of the urban tree canopy, which impacts their ability to breathe healthy air, exercise, stay cool and pursue happiness. These people include children, houseless, elderly and those living in low-income areas. I second that."
01_22_2020,homelessness,"It seems that they assume that the children's innocence will somehow be tarnished if they see homelessness. or that the children might be afraid of people who are experiencing homelessness. My answer to that question is that we tell them that we live in a community where we care about one another, no matter our differences, because of our humanity."
01_22_2020,homeless,"Let's make visible the words of [ORGANIZATION] who said, The greatness of a community is most accurately measured by the compassionate actions of its members. As part of [ORGANIZATION], a teacher at the neighboring preschool, and a neighbor, I'm committed to working with [PERSON], ORG2, and the parents of my young students to ensure that this village is a success. Thank you for considering my point of view."
01_22_2020,unhoused,"DATE0, I actually helped launch the coalition with around 20 other neighbors when I was working at [ORGANIZATION]. Since then, we've grown to become a vibrant and active network of nearly 300 neighbors who have signed our letter of support. This includes both housed and unhoused neighbors, business owners, faith-based leaders, and leaders of key community groups and schools."
01_22_2020,houseless,"I'm also a mom of a [ORGANIZATION] who goes to preschool about five blocks away from the proposed site. In both of my capacities as a neighborhood activist and a mom, I want to extend my gratitude to [ORGANIZATION], Mayor [PERSON], and all the commissioners in support of this project. I've spent a lot of time working with houseless neighbors in [ORGANIZATION]."
01_22_2020,housing crisis,"We know that the village is not the end all be all and that neighbors, including members of our coalition still have questions. But the village is an important resource that we are fortunate to have in [ORGANIZATION] and we have faith that we can constructively and collaboratively figure out the unknowns. Plus it's just really cool seeing a faith based community who has long sat on open land offering up their property as a solution to [PERSON]'s housing crisis."
01_22_2020,houseless,"We've got a lot of people who are suffering on our streets, and I am so grateful and appreciative of people like you who understand that we all have a role in actually helping people who are suffering. So in my neighborhood, we also have an anti-houseless group but they're not actually offering to provide housing so that those folks don't have to be on the [STREET]. And so I thank you very much for being here."
01_22_2020,houseless,"Before you start, [ORGANIZATION], I just want to remind you, and I know you know this, [ORGANIZATION] is funded totally through the general fund, as is our houseless services, as is fire, as is [TIME]. There are other bureaus that have specific money based on rates, based on et cetera, et cetera, right? [ORGANIZATION] doesn't have that luxury."
01_22_2020,houseless,"I realize that there are a whole lot of great intent going out and killing things that shouldn't be here, but people shouldn't be one of them. And there is an unbelievable amount of reports that I'm hearing from the houseless community about how they've been sprayed. This is not the issue that we are addressing."
02_17_2016,homeless,I am here to talk about on behalf of a group of homeless campers that are camped along FAC0 over in southeast [ORGANIZATION]. I'm having a bit of trouble. I just had a tooth pulled
02_17_2016,homeless,"No, we can't do it yet. We'll go to regular calendar. Item 153.  153, authorize a competitive solicitation for the provision of treatment readiness services, transitional housing, and follow-up retention support services to chemically dependent homeless adult chronic arrestees."
02_17_2016,homeless,"And that technically complies with our public contracting laws, but it doesn't give us the ability to measure their performance and their proposal against other options. And whether we choose to require co-location or not, for example, in [ORGANIZATION], we have all kinds of different providers that provide services to homeless people throughout a continuum. We don't have one provider that manages shelters, does transitional housing, does other things."
02_17_2016,homeless,"And we're talking about barricades amongst the homeless. I mean... They have people sweeping people [ORGANIZATION], the most vulnerable people, moving them from one spot to the next."
02_17_2016,homeless,"They're one of the only city agencies that actually get notified of homeless sweeps that are going on. And they're supposed to go out and do outreach, which they rarely do. And one thing about [ORGANIZATION], too, is you can't just go to [ORGANIZATION]."
02_17_2016,homeless,"And these agencies are actually, you know, you talk about collaboration. I agree they need to collaborate because, you know, I was actually homeless and I fell back to the streets through going through [ORGANIZATION]."
02_17_2016,homeless,"And when we look through the records of how many homeless people have died when we're averaging a number of, say, 50 to 100 a year, and we start looking at the data that it trickles down to people with addictions, we have to understand the trauma that they're facing when they're out on the streets and society has pushed them away out of their homes, their apartments. Friends have stepped at a distance because law enforcement might say, hey,  That's guilt by association. If you're near that person, if you're a friend with that person, we're looking at you also, and we want to know what you're doing."
02_17_2016,homelessness,"Sure.  let me repeat what i said earlier before you before you start before you start excuse me i want to say that it's ridiculous it costs 85 a night to house people in these transitional contractors that have been working with the city since forever who's who's responsible for that  It is a cycle that keeps going. They're making money off of homelessness. It's part of the capitalist system of [ORGANIZATION], and it's not working."
02_17_2016,homeless,I have a slumlord. I have [PERSON] throughout my building. I've been homeless for [ORGANIZATION] now This is when I first came here in [LOCATION]
02_17_2016,homeless,"and I was calling PERSON0 PERSON1 fish because I thought she was [ORGANIZATION]  After all of this, I finally found a [STREET] to live, but it takes me [TIME] to get here to testify on behalf of many people who would like to just have $50 a month to pay for a roof over their housing. And while I applaud you for finally in your lame duck session for getting emergency housing for the people on the streets, we're talking 20,000 children that have been killed.  identified as homeless in our communities I teach at one of those schools thank you there are many more people on the house on the streets and we need to house them the people that are already housed need only a little bit of per month and that'll be much cheaper for the city to keep the housing and put in rent control when I told that head of the home forward that we need rent control I said you may be out of a job  but at least you'd be out of a job in a city with rent control thank you thanks very much thank you for calling upon me again mayor all right anyone else on this item then this council go ahead and want to go ahead and take action okay then let's take a vote please on the ordinance"
02_17_2016,homelessness,"It has meant that [ORGANIZATION] staff have left the very communities they serve in order to find housing for their families. It has meant empty cupboards, empty bank accounts, and a number of disturbing cases, bankruptcy and homelessness. This practice not only hurt [ORGANIZATION] staff, it hurt our communities."
02_17_2016,homeless; housing crisis,"So as long as [ORGANIZATION] is under Commissioner [PERSON], to please consider the livability of our communities in hand with the parks. DATE0 seems to me to be a very arbitrary number as far as the [STREET] we've built our city. And I don't know if you get around as much as I do,  As a homeless person and as a person who's been moved around a lot because of the housing crisis in our city over [LOCATION], I've been very, very discouraged by the [STREET] we live."
02_17_2016,affordable housing,"And, [ORGANIZATION], I appreciated the presentation that Director [PERSON] gave DATE0 because he laid out where we are and where we intend to go through the [ORGANIZATION] framework. And I'll be discussing with both you and the mayor a housing impact statement that can become a regular feature of these matters so we can –  we can test where we are against the um the goals that we've established as a bureau and a council this has been a successful development and i have long believed that we should have the option of extending the abatement for long DATE1 because the commensurate public benefit is affordable housing in our community so i'm pleased to support this [ORGANIZATION]  well as commissioner PERSON3 alluded to this is a good investment worth renewing it maintains 203 out of 209 units to be affordable with 131 of those units affordable to those between zero and sixty percent of median family income so it's a very worthwhile uh abatement worth continuing hi ORG1 fails"
02_17_2016,affordable housing,"We hear from about 3,000 older adults in our community. And the four areas of major concern right now are housing, not a surprise, I suppose, affordable housing, identity theft, scams, and fraud. transportation, and isolation and neglect."
02_17_2016,affordable housing,"a group of older adults headed down to [ORGANIZATION] to advocate for affordable housing. In response to the number of calls that we're getting from older adults who are being priced out of their homes and can't afford the large rent increases or experiencing no-cause evictions, we decided that we wanted to educate ourselves about how to be better advocates for this. And so we created a series, a session, to help older adults be their best debt."
02_17_2016,housing insecurity,"So those who had experienced housing insecurity. And then we created a partnership with [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, [PERSON], [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION], to put together a series of  which we could become better housing advocates and this included that trip to soon that you see there and also participating in the [PERSON]'s discrimination tour which gave us a little bit of a historical perspective on the issues facing us [ORGANIZATION] the next slide shows oh that's part of that was one of the activities to one of our volunteers this one is the  It's the opening of FAC0, so we participate in those community events also."
02_17_2016,homelessness,"We know that some of the actions there in [ORGANIZATION] were good, but they could be improved upon, especially in light of the current crisis and homelessness issues that we're facing in our community. We also want to identify priorities to increase age-friendliness in [ORGANIZATION]'s housing. This is actually not as easy of a lift as I originally thought."
02_17_2016,affordable housing,"It also has fed into a lot of temporary housing opportunities, such as FAC0. And then in some areas, and specifically you'll hear from [ORGANIZATION], actually the deconstruction of homes leads to affordable homes because it's helping support their affordable housing efforts. Thank you."
02_17_2016,homelessness,"We offer a minimum starting salary of $12.50 an hour with full health benefits and [ORGANIZATION] paid vacation, depending on the length of tenure. And our profits, such as they are,  are reinvested into the community through our community outreach program. And we also donate tens of thousands of dollars of materials to various organizations around town [LOCATION], including many that address the issue of homelessness, such as [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and ORG2."
02_17_2016,affordable housing,"This would more than double our fundraising for affordable housing as well and enable [ORGANIZATION] and our neighbors to build an additional 14 homes per year. In looking to build our deconstruction program, we have already started partnering with [ORGANIZATION] to start priming our customers for salvage lumber. We are also talking to deconstruction contractors about setting up partnerships that would allow us to do a hybrid-type decon where they would take the building down and our volunteers and staff could capture the salvage materials."
02_17_2016,affordable housing,"I think several of you already know we own over 800 units of single- and multifamily affordable housing here in the city of [ORGANIZATION], located in over 30 neighborhoods. We believe that everyone should be able to afford a safe, stable, and healthy home. We develop affordable housing for families to rent and for first-time homebuyers."
02_17_2016,affordable housing,"Being a manual process, deconstruction, as we've talked about a little bit here too, though, equals more labor and more opportunity for living wage jobs. And as a provider of affordable housing and knowing that the amount of housing that is affordable to many working families in [ORGANIZATION] right now isn't keeping up with the need, the opportunity to provide jobs is very important, too.  to help us bridge that gap and to ensure that folks are self-sufficient, which is certainly an end goal that I think we all have. I do just want to bring up very briefly a couple of considerations and perhaps challenges that I've seen and I'm sort of aware of with the potential for deconstruction."
02_17_2016,affordable housing,"It does cost developers a little more money and time sometimes, probably more often than not, but that's the cost of replacing with new construction. When they're not deconstructed, the building is being subsidized by the neighbors and the environment, and we just have to be clear about that. Deconstruction is not a detriment to affordable housing."
02_17_2016,affordable housing,"I heard [ORGANIZATION] say that it was cost neutral. I've heard that it's $9,000 to $10,000, and a lot depends on what has to be done. Excavation is a big issue because when they deconstruct and there's a basement,  part of the deconstruction does not include the excavation so then whoever is doing the building has to then hire someone to do that added excavation so there was a concern of how that cost would be covered and most people are pointing saying well the developer or the landowner should pay for that but  it's only going to trickle downhill or uphill to the next buyer for affordable housing."
02_17_2016,affordable housing,So those are the concerns. I addressed the concerns at [ORGANIZATION] about the equity and the funding and how it would affect  affect affordable housing that comes after. That was a big one.
02_17_2016,affordable housing,"And then the question of  who really pays you know if we're paying if it if it is the difference between nine thousand one thousand is five thousand bucks who how is that five thousand dollars going to be absorbed into the process and why not share that cost with the industry with an incentive with some other because right now it's focused laser focused on the development industry and i think that um  They can surely be a participant in the process, but I think all it's going to do is add to the cost of affordable housing, and there's other ways to get at that, incentivizing people to do deconstruction. So I think that's it. Thank you very much."
02_17_2016,affordable housing,"And I think... The costs, if they're added and they don't make affordable housing, I don't think they're making affordable housing. You had PERSON0 sitting here before saying the average cost of the homes that he builds are $700,000."
02_17_2016,affordable housing,"I've been writing and rewriting my testimony as I've been listening to everyone hoping to present a slightly new perspective. I'm here to give testimony in support of this resolution as an affordable housing advocate, a fan and neighbor of [ORGANIZATION], and a concerned citizen. DATE0, [ORGANIZATION] researchers shared the somewhat alarming results of their [ORGANIZATION] study, which revealed [ORGANIZATION]'s hottest and most polluted areas."
02_17_2016,affordable housing,"So it's going to increase our problem with affordable housing. I think that if we find a [STREET] to take these 150 houses, let's say $10,000 a house subsidy, if we can find a [STREET] to subsidize it, that's $1.5 million. Right."
01_25_2017,homeless,Do you have a trash pickup or...  sanitation and laundry services you know it's not really that difficult to cost about three thousand dollars so the city is spending three hundred thousand dollars on cleaning with all the activities they want to do about the homeless homeless people themselves let's hear them  That's the simple solution to this whole thing that's been going on for [ORGANIZATION]. Here's a question for everybody. What about the nonprofits?
01_25_2017,homelessness,"If we solve, what happens to the nonprofits? They lose their jobs. The very people that are supposed to be solving homelessness have a hatred in keeping it going."
01_25_2017,homeless,"My ex-Tigard neighbor lady participates in this. ""  Almost all the homeless and poor people are their targets, they say. They lure most of them to [ORGANIZATION], they say, and don't let most of them work, so they're forced to live in the shelters and low-income housing places that are loaded with these harassment technologies."
01_25_2017,homeless; affordable housing,"DATE0 was [LOCATION] that you became the housing commissioner. Since then, we fell headlong into an affordable housing state of emergency, and we watched the number of homeless people skyrocket. DATE2, just as the rain and cold were moving in, you pulled the plug on a project that some wealthy [ORGANIZATION] developers had created to shelter 1,000 people."
01_25_2017,homeless,"One of the issues pertaining to the homeless that I have is that  We need to lower the flags to show respect to any of the homeless that have passed away. We need to have a moment of silence for any of the homeless that have passed away. The other mayor, Mayor [PERSON], refused to do that."
01_25_2017,homeless,"Mayor [PERSON], you have the opportunity to do that and show the community that you have respect for the homeless. And when they do pass away, you show respect to the community members. the homeless again that have passed away now moving on to the next issue on the Superfund cleanup site again I've talked to Commissioner [PERSON] I'd like to have a director brought in to [ORGANIZATION] and begin planning the dredging task in the maintenance of the river it's long overdue we're looking at a billion plus dollar bill that the ORG1 has done a record of decision on with a lot of data"
01_25_2017,homeless,And when it's gone... How many homeless people will be able to sleep in the server room? Hopefully we'll have a better solution at [ORGANIZATION] when those old iron pieces or server rack equipment is gone.
01_25_2017,homeless,"So in our developments, we strive to develop creative solutions in response to market demand, including a temporary [INSTITUTION] in one of our downtown buildings. At [ORGANIZATION], we are bringing together landscape and workspace to create a different type of workplace, one that does not hermetically seal us from the outdoors. So to this end, [ORGANIZATION] dissolves the architectural boundaries that traditionally exist between the inside and outside and celebrates the natural environment, which is one of the main reasons many of us choose to live in [ORGANIZATION]."
01_25_2017,houseless,"Thank you. I'm concerned personally about this project. I can tell you probably 20, [DATE], [DATE], [DATE], [DATE], I don't know how many hundreds of people are out on the streets of [ORGANIZATION] right now, houseless, all better things to spend money on than fixing cracks in sidewalks or making more room for more bike lanes for people to ride their bikes when there's people who don't even have a blanket around."
01_25_2017,homeless,"My concern about the development and [ORGANIZATION], L-I-D, is that this money is used for gentrification, and with gentrification, we get a bike-friendly project, but it's homeless unfriendly. It's so nice that the developer gives money for upgrades, but we need to understand that this project  This is a danger to people who are currently living on the [STREET]. Where are they supposed to go?"
01_25_2017,homeless; houseless,"Until you have houses for the houseless, I object to the sprucing up of the [STREET] for bikers and for others. What exactly is the [INSTITUTION] the developer was referring to? Can addicts come in?"
01_25_2017,housing crisis,"that money has been used to address our existing infrastructure maintenance need and the housing crisis. So like the rest of the council, the auditor should have the ability to request carryovers and request positional authority within the existing budget. I don't see that having a carryover of an average of $465,000, $100,000 is the best choice for taxpayers' money."
01_04_2017,affordable housing,"We have – yeah, please, Commissioner [PERSON]. No, this is – there's no presentation unless you have questions, but –  this is simply [ORGANIZATION] the council did authorize the first acquisition under the affordable housing bond measure the [ORGANIZATION] apartments and so this uh this item basically allows [ORGANIZATION] to assume all the miscellaneous contracts associated with that acquisition everything from landscaping services to well smoke detectors all those things all those services  PERSON1, the [ORGANIZATION] Director, is here if there are questions. So this is more in the nature of a housekeeping matter?"
01_04_2017,homeless,"We had some questions about when [ORGANIZATION] goes out and does contracts,  We're concerned about that. We're getting emails about the organization. Is it [PERSON] that runs most of the homeless under housing?"
01_04_2017,homeless,"I hate these initials. I really do because I get confused with all these initials. But the contractors that deal with the homeless people, if they're selling stuff, I want them in jail."
01_04_2017,homeless,"I was homeless for [ORGANIZATION], and I was taken in by the [ORGANIZATION], FAC0. I found it was a very resourceful [STREET]. You do bar reports for laundry money."
01_04_2017,homeless,"It's hard to look for a job if you don't take a shower or something or have clean laundry. If anybody walked into [ORGANIZATION] and said they were homeless and need help, I'd refer them to FAC0, and I have. And another resource is [ORGANIZATION].  is another [STREET]."
01_04_2017,homeless,"So if people are trying to do things, I'm just making a reference, like these apartments, people are trying to do something, and whether they're selling coats or something, they're just attempting to do something. And we're working forward in [ORGANIZATION], especially when FAC0 started. I spent DATE0 in the basement homeless."
01_03_2018,houseless,"Oh, this is loud [ORGANIZATION]. It's freezing outside, yet the houseless remain on the streets in pain, suffering in the cold, hungry, and some perhaps about to medicate themselves to death because the weight of sorrow breaks hearts. DATE1."
01_03_2018,houseless,"Buses should be used to escort houseless people who agree to go to shelters with their belongings and their animals. All city vehicles should be used to go out to locate houseless people to see if they are okay, in need of emergency care, or if they want shelter to escort them.  that the mayor should go onto all media and request that all churches and places of worship open their doors to allow people in. I asked the mayor to collect a database of volunteer doctors and medics for on-call duty during the crisis and a database of volunteers who could person shelters during the crisis then and now."
01_03_2018,houseless,"The response was far less than what I consider humane. We got a one-room shelter downtown, one in [ORGANIZATION], no thanks to the city, and one in [ORGANIZATION]. DATE0, our first houseless person died that we know of [LOCATION]."
01_03_2018,houseless,Fill the bank foreclosed houses with houseless. Fill empty rooms in hotels. Change the paradigm of what affordable is.
01_03_2018,houseless,"Let's get real about it. In [ORGANIZATION], the council wasted precious time trying to shut me down, my voice, the voices of all activists in [ORGANIZATION], that the houseless suffered all the [STREET] to their deaths. Because you chose not to do the right thing, because you chose to vilify activists, because you chose to talk about us and bully us about our public testimony on [ORGANIZATION], because you chose to waste time, now we have our first [ORGANIZATION]."
01_03_2018,houseless,"No name, no answer, it's just a houseless person dead on the streets. The city council will continue to applaud itself for doing the least rather than the most, and people will continue to die. People will vilify activists, our voices, for fighting back, for fighting back to maintain our rights, fighting back against police aggression, brutality, and murder, for fighting back against commissioners who think that no laws apply to them."
01_03_2018,houseless,We will fight back. We will not stop. ORG0 the houseless.
01_03_2018,houseless,"Deal with the cops. Deal with this reality. No name, no answers, just a houseless person dead on the streets."
01_03_2018,homeless,"We have a homeless outreach team that goes out [ORGANIZATION], takes food, shelter, clothing, food and clothing, and also hygiene packets out throughout the city. We also provide meals, hot meals, and food baskets out of our outreach emergency food program as well. So a lot's happening and a lot's going on."
01_03_2018,houseless,"We were hoping to see some information about the houseless and the people living on our streets under this emergency. We realize this is a grant, has limitations, but we didn't see anything. Here's our problem."
01_03_2018,houseless,This is a grant for [ORGANIZATION] to be able to respond on behalf of all of us to emergencies in our community. That includes houseless people as well as those who are out. Can you straighten out 211?
01_03_2018,affordable housing,"One is an unusually high number of retirements.  partly because of people aging out of their positions, partly because of uncertainty around PERS. There's a whole host of reasons, but we have had a tremendous brain drain, which we are now in the process of hiring for. Second, as my colleagues know, there was a huge crush of work [ORGANIZATION] at the development services, in part because of concerns that under proposed changes to federal law, certain things would be forfeited, particularly in the area of affordable housing development."
01_03_2018,homeless,"If they really need case management because they are homeless and they have no identification, they haven't had regular access to health care, our case manager focuses on that. If they really need the chemical dependency, their addiction is the primary thing we focus on that. So we really do tailor it to"
01_21_2015,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION], who do we have for communications? Item 77, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding homeless bill of rights. Ms. [PERSON]."
01_21_2015,homeless,"Certainly. Okay.  [DATE], request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel regarding homeless Bill of Rights. And 79, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel regarding homeless Bill of Rights."
01_21_2015,homeless,Ms. [PERSON]. My name is Amber [PERSON]. I'm here on behalf of [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] campaign.
01_21_2015,houseless,"Laws and ordinances that target the houseless community for carrying out basic survival activities, such as sleeping, eating, or sharing food in public, and erecting a tent or putting up a tarp to protect themselves from the elements, do not exist for the purpose of justice. Yes. Furthermore, I assert that these laws and ordinances exist to perpetrate a cycle of houselessness by throwing up yet another barrier to housing and employment."
01_21_2015,houseless,"For example, if you are cited for sleeping in the doorway, the charge is criminal trespass. Therefore...  When you apply for an apartment or a job, this shows up on your record when they perform a background check, making you less likely to succeed. Keeping people houseless by criminalizing them for being houseless and unable to enter our already overcrowded shelter system benefits no one."
01_21_2015,houseless,"[ORGANIZATION] also said, one who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice is in reality expressing the highest respect for the law. This is what civil rights leaders have done in the past. We have a shameful past in this country of upholding discriminatory laws and ordinances designed to target different communities of color, and now we have a shameful present of upholding these same type of laws and ordinances.  targeting the houseless community."
01_21_2015,homeless,"Hi, my name is [ORGANIZATION], and I'm representing [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON] said,  All men, women, and children are created equal. The creation is not the issue."
01_21_2015,affordable housing; houseless,"The issue is that there is a systemic problem that creates cuts in affordable housing and throws up more barriers for people to obtain the little affordable housing that is left. In the midst of this crisis, laws and ordinances designed to target and criminalize the houseless and low-income are created. Although we have made great strides in the struggle for equal rights for all, we cannot truly say as a nation that we treat all as they are created equally."
01_21_2015,houseless,"As long as it is still illegal to criminalize and discriminate against the houseless community for carrying out basic activities needed for survival, such as eating and resting. Thank you. [ORGANIZATION] also said, history will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clamor of the bad people, but the appalling silence of the good people."
01_21_2015,homeless,"I want to believe that our city council, the audience, and everyone watching this meeting are all good people. We cannot remain silent as our most vulnerable citizens are subjected to unjust laws and ordinances that criminalize them for erecting a tent, putting up a tarp,  or sometimes merely covering themselves with a blanket to protect themselves from the elements carrying out the simple act of sleeping which is necessary biological need for everyone should not be illegal for anyone please come out and support for the homeless bill of rights and the right to rest bill it's not about separate rights it's about equal rights"
01_21_2015,homeless; houseless,"Our bill will help assure that no one will be targeted or expect the biological damage  needs to sleep regarding the house of status. Mother of the King says, I had a dream that on the red hills of [ORGANIZATION], son of the former slaves and the former slave owners will be able to return  to sit together at the table of brotherhood. We also have a dream, our dream that is the homeless community no longer be targeted with justice and laws of ordinance and seek the discrimination against the crime people based on their pursuit of housing status, the laws of order used to target the houseless community [ORGANIZATION]."
01_21_2015,homeless,"Thank you very much. If people want to find more about this campaign, how can they do that and how can they donate to help people? They can go to [URL], and there's information on there about the Homeless Bill of Rights."
01_21_2015,homelessness,"So I wanted to talk about the earlier issue about homelessness where we were talking. Actually, we're talking about that in the context of communications that people sign up for in advance. We can't really have people interrupt the agenda to address issues that were addressed in communications."
02_19_2020,homeless,"Hi, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]. Okay, so [ORGANIZATION] there are thefts of people's phones in all the shelters. And when you have people who are, you've got a couple of different kinds of people."
02_24_2016,homeless,"but you haven't met with me one-on-one and this is my only chance to ask you if you have followed up on your promise thanks for coming this thank you very much next person please  Item 165, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding horns for the homeless. Come on up, please. So you don't have an answer to that?"
02_24_2016,homeless,"You all look very familiar because I've done a lot of research and your names come up. My name is [ORGANIZATION] and I'm here to represent [ORGANIZATION]. DATE0, my friend shared with me a moment that he had with his son."
02_24_2016,homelessness,They were walking the streets of [ORGANIZATION] when they passed a man curled up on the ground. The son asked his father why the man was just laying there with no shoes on his feet. And the father shared about homelessness.
02_24_2016,homeless,Give it up for Horns for the Homeless. All right. We can break the rules for that.
02_24_2016,affordable housing,"In a press release from [ORGANIZATION] states, Mayor PERSON0 [PERSON] announced that an additional $66.7 million in funds will be directed to affordable housing projects in five urban renewal districts over DATE2. We applaud these efforts, yet it's a long [STREET] to the top if you want to rock and roll. One person can make a difference in another's life, but imagine what a city can accomplish."
02_24_2016,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] are public servants. We strongly advocate for activation of public space for community events. These special events bring artistry and culture to our city, providing the homeless a sense of belonging, eliminating segregation, and reintroducing them into society."
02_24_2016,homeless,"Through music, we provide compassion. And combined, we lead them to self-sufficiency. Like the closing of a live entertainment show, please give it up one more time for [ORGANIZATION]."
02_24_2016,homeless,"They are in our [ORGANIZATION] program, but they come with a host of issues, many of them homeless, couch surfing, hungry. They are suffering from trauma from foster care. They have drug and alcohol issues, behavioral problems, mental health issues."
02_24_2016,affordable housing,"We can go with it. Okay. There's been a ton of housing built along the streetcar line, but one thing that's off the mast is we think at least 30 percent, but definitely quantifiable 25 percent of all the housing units built along the streetcar line are subsidized affordable housing."
02_24_2016,affordable housing,"I'd like to mention that, Commissioner, because I think some people have had amnesia about some of the projects we jump-started in [LOCATION], 10, and 11 that were designed to, they were effectively stimulus jobs, whether they were parks, affordable housing, or other things, and they were very important, and they were important as catalytic investments as well. And  We seem to have forgotten that we've just passed through the Great Recession. Just flag for this analysis."
02_24_2016,affordable housing,"Now that we know that you can create value,  How are we as a city capturing that value and deploying it? Is it going towards the streetcar? Is it going towards affordable housing, jobs?"
02_24_2016,homelessness,"I hope this presentation is posted online prominently or will be. I have, as of [TIME], 537 emails urging me to do more on helping people who are experiencing homelessness. And we had a great presentation on a home for everyone."
02_24_2016,affordable housing,"And that's what she did. But that's my favorite story because I can see those older people that she's talking about who are living in affordable housing that we've worked hard to create, living a complete life because of this good thing that we've all done. So let's keep up the good work."
02_24_2016,affordable housing,"One is a  kind of flexible creative industrial use one is parking and one is affordable housing and so the ordinance before you [ORGANIZATION] is a set of amendments to the loan document that our director [PERSON] would be able to uh to authorize that would allow the purchaser to immediately pay back fifty thousand dollars of the back interest and then begin making regular payments with the intention of fully repaying the loan and back interest over DATE1  So this is DATE2 in the making. We're very pleased to be able to bring it before you [ORGANIZATION]. Nicely done, [PERSON]."
02_24_2016,homeless,"You just made that statement to me. What am I allowed to discuss with you outside of this meeting? But if Mr. [PERSON]'s example is a great one, she talks to you and you say to her, you have a concern with our homeless policy."
02_24_2016,homeless,"She runs into me in the hallway and says, [ORGANIZATION] has a concern with the homeless policy. Or even if I just say to you, I have a concern with the homeless policy. Potentially is in violation of the law for not holding a public meeting, noticing it, having a chance for you to be there for her to tell me that she has a concern with homeless  homeless camping."
02_24_2016,houseless,"We need to remember that, that it's a public responsibility to take care of those who are houseless, for those who need help getting help, and for those who are desperate. And that's why [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION] built [PERSON]. We now think of it as a [STREET] to go for entertainment, but it was a poor farm."
02_24_2016,homelessness,Thank you. I appreciate that. yes um [ORGANIZATION] my head and my heart are in conflict and i can't remember saying that very often in [LOCATION] that i've worked on housing and homelessness issues so i'm going to begin with some areas of agreement i first want to acknowledge commissioner [ORGANIZATION] as the champion for [ORGANIZATION] and the adults they serve during my tenure on the council no one  No one has done more to address poverty and inequality in our community.
02_24_2016,homelessness,"And I am deeply grateful for the partnership that we have established on a number of issues, including working to end homelessness. And I also want to recognize R2-D2, which has become a symbol of hope, of resilience, and of self-determination. We owe them our best."
02_24_2016,homelessness,"It disregards concerns raised by [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], excuse me, neighbors of the proposed site and others. And it ignores health and safety  issues posed by its proximity to its immediate neighbor, a business working with highly volatile and caustic chemicals on a [ORGANIZATION] basis. This proposal is not aligned with ORG2, [PERSON], the county, or our [LOCATION], which are the roadmaps that we have developed with the community to guide our work."
02_24_2016,homelessness,"And it does not include clear accountability measures, benchmarks for success, or even a budget. Finally, this proposal represents, in my judgment, a new and troubling approach, shifting key responsibilities for addressing homelessness from [ORGANIZATION] to ORG1. I fully accept the arguments that this proposal is better than most of the alternatives."
02_24_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"Well, I want to thank Commissioner [PERSON] and Mayor [PERSON] for all their leadership. And while I have been the first to say, and I've said this when R2D2 first moved to [ORGANIZATION] and [LOCATION], I don't support tent camps as a solution to homelessness. I believe in affordable housing as the path, the most desired path."
02_24_2016,houseless,"I met with the police chief [ORGANIZATION], and he said the police do not get called to [ORGANIZATION]. As my colleagues have said, [ORGANIZATION] has established itself as a good neighbor. And I think in the situation we're in, when we have a group of houseless people who are committed to being good neighbors, then we should go out of our [STREET] to work with them."
02_24_2016,homelessness,"Thank you. [ORGANIZATION] said that there's nothing more difficult to plan or to execute than the creation of a new system because the innovator has all the resistance of those who are used to the old [STREET] and lukewarm approval from all who will benefit from the new [ORGANIZATION] he said that I quoted all the time because it keeps coming true and [PERSON] is creating a new system for homelessness in our city and I'm proud to lead that on his behalf  We'll suspend the rules for [TIME] for a staff person who's worked hard. Thank you, PERSON2."
02_24_2016,homelessness,"It's incomplete, but it's better than drift. It's better than accepting that homelessness is permanent and that we'll never get any better. And we're in a time right now where there is a national fog around us that seems to...  indicate that things can't get better and that government can't be innovative."
02_24_2016,homeless,"We've housed...  hundreds and hundreds of veterans, 695 as a matter of fact, during our commitment that we're now getting certified by the federal government for having met, of reducing our homeless veterans population to a point where now we can stay even instead of having it get worse, stay even at a very low number. We have opened 400 temporary or permanent shelter spaces just in [ORGANIZATION] since this council declared a housing state of emergency, after [LOCATION] and [LOCATION] and [LOCATION] of no such progress. So it is possible to make it better."
02_24_2016,affordable housing,And we could also build a lot of affordable housing in there if we did that. Look at what we did. We actually did.
01_28_2016,homeless,"A sergeant allowed two officers who shot at [ORGANIZATION] to remain in the field because they were in, quote, combat mode. Nobody compared Officer [PERSON] shooting at the back of African-American teenager [LOCATION] to [ORGANIZATION], though [ORGANIZATION] did point out there was no review of the canine, which bit the wrong person when released in that case. Neither Officer PERSON4 nor PERSON5 was disciplined, even though they put themselves into a position that precipitated their shooting and killing homeless veteran [PERSON]."
01_14_2016,homeless,oh no but that's why I'm just bringing I'm just leading into something I'm sorry I am just my point was and we have an issue with the homeless and yet there was three hundred thousand dollars available for this bike study
01_14_2016,homeless,"But an admired leader said that at this time you can't set this area aside like a rare book and say nobody can touch it. You really need users  to come with you and help you maintain and manage it and patrol this area to keep out the homeless camps, the dumps, and things like that. So I really encourage you to consider getting the mountain bikers involved in doing the trail design."
01_14_2015,affordable housing,"So here we're coming into legal cannabis in [ORGANIZATION]. I'm a little bit miffed that my [ORGANIZATION] research was destroyed by my non-profit affordable housing landlord you're partnering with, Commissioner [PERSON]. Halt at the dump.  along with my registered medical [PERSON]."
01_14_2015,affordable housing,"Affordable housing, nonprofit landlord has been keeping the apartment that they destroyed my research illegally. And you're partnering with the mayor? How am I supposed to feel good about this?"
01_14_2015,homeless,"I'm PERSON0. I'm the Business Operations Manager for [ORGANIZATION], and I'm going to talk to you about our innovation project. Ours is about assisting homeless families"
01_14_2015,homeless,"So our city has hundreds of homeless assistance programs operating on [ORGANIZATION]. Faith-based organizations are about a third of these programs, including the majority of food and substantial portion of all shelter and drop-in services. For example, at our faith-based summit that we had in [LOCATION], we had 15 churches participate."
01_14_2015,homeless,"Eight of those churches do hunger and food services on a [ORGANIZATION] basis, and nine of them provide some type of homeless service, either clothing, shelter, letting families park in their parking lots, a variety of things, which if we had not had that summit, we would not have known about what the services are. So despite the long history of them helping people in need, we know very little about what they're doing. And they serve primarily a diverse population."
01_14_2015,homeless,"Faith-based organizations have historically steered clear government because we require a lot of restraints and a lot of rules and things that they don't generally feel like they should have to –  to do in order to provide help to people. This innovation project aims to couple the specialized care and commitment provided by faith-based organizations serving the homeless with city services and housing resources. As part of the proposal, we'll appoint a staff member as a faith-based liaison to work with churches to develop a data and information sharing program."
01_14_2015,homelessness,"And this second portion was recommended by [ORGANIZATION], who was working with the city on the ORG1 projects [ORGANIZATION]. This project aims to create a new relationship contributing new information to the city's efforts to reduce and end homelessness. It will contribute new knowledge about the needs of [ORGANIZATION] residents and the strategies to best meet those needs."
01_14_2015,homeless; homelessness,"So that's a fair answer. Now, one of the things that I like about this, and I'm referring mainly on the homelessness on the data sharing, what I'd like to see possibly is more data on more of a [ORGANIZATION] count of people that are homeless, say, on a [LOCATION] basis out through the city. But why I mention that is I want to see more of a,  maybe a more of a sophisticated system set up to where we really monitor that number."
01_14_2015,homeless,"And I'm talking about where people get their food, if they're chronically homeless outside. I want to have that data to really understand that number, how it's changing, how it's changing with the population, with people moving out of the state, people moving into the state, etc.  I really want that number to even be broken down to central downtown, east side, certain areas by the block. I want that number accessed."
01_14_2015,homelessness,"PERSON0? Good [TIME], Commissioners. I'm glad that [PERSON] retouched on the issue of –  homelessness."
01_14_2015,homeless,"I know that it's a difficult issue for to find funding in places, you know, there are federal restrictions. We really, we kind of know that we just need more units and Commissioner [PERSON] and all of you have worked to take steps in that direction. [TIME] I was particularly aware of which doorways already had people asleep prior towards [TIME] and I hope that  [ORGANIZATION] we might have some capacity to directly approach people and engage, have a facility where we can actually rescue people and actually just accost people and actually be glad that some homeless people, all they want to do is rest."
01_14_2015,homeless,"He's not the chief, and I don't have his card. I have a couple other people's information that I gathered. But I was concerned because I live in a downtown [ORGANIZATION] area, and there are a lot of homeless people that live in that area that I live in, and I think I proposed to you to really come out there on the streets and hang out with me for a [ORGANIZATION] or two."
01_14_2015,homelessness,"I think everything happened for a reason in this life. If I had not been there for her and her being there for me, I wouldn't still be here because she was the person that encouraged me to continue to keep going with this movement. And as I've been a part of it, it's just been so many touching factors to what's going on with our population of people of homelessness, of mental illness, and all of these different things in [ORGANIZATION]."
01_14_2015,homeless,"And it's just so hurtful that I'm collecting data. I'm advocating for homeless people at this point. And I'm setting up a space for them to come because they're not going to come down here with all their luggage and everything that they have, you know, to talk to someone that they don't know that really haven't done nothing for them."
01_14_2015,homeless; homelessness,"And there's several pictures. I'm compiling a documentary about the homeless people,  you know the hiddenness behind homelessness and it's not always about a person being an addict you know people want help in this city but if they're having to be out on the [STREET] and women have to get with the man that they don't know just to have a pallet to lay down and i could get to go to a warm bed [TIME] mayor that's not right for me thank you so much for being here and for coming forward and being an advocate thank you"
01_14_2016,homeless,oh no but that's why I'm just bringing I'm just leading into something I'm sorry I am just my point was and we have an issue with the homeless and yet there was three hundred thousand dollars available for this bike study
01_14_2016,homeless,"But an admired leader said that at this time you can't set this area aside like a rare book and say nobody can touch it. You really need users  to come with you and help you maintain and manage it and patrol this area to keep out the homeless camps, the dumps, and things like that. So I really encourage you to consider getting the mountain bikers involved in doing the trail design."
02_04_2015,houseless,"Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding houseless issues. Good morning, [PERSON]. Welcome."
02_04_2015,houseless,"What I want to talk about is the present situation of the houseless people sleeping out in the streets. I know we was doing a houseless count to get exact numbers, and I heard it was passed down through the Commissioner [PERSON] that there would be no sweeps so they can get the proper count of the houseless community. Well, I had slides and I have proof that the people were still being swept and they were being told they took their belongings and they were being told to sit there and wait for people to come and...  and do a survey for them."
02_04_2015,homeless,"So I would implore you that you sponsor the Homeless Bill of Rights Right to Rest Act that's going before legislators as we speak now, and I would like for you all to back us up because who knows best what the homeless community is suffering in this city. Thank you. That's all I have to say."
02_04_2015,homeless,"We still have anywhere from 1,800 to 3,[ADDRESS] to sleep and be safe from the police. Police sweeps continue. Fencing off areas used by campus seems to be the new threat to the homeless."
02_04_2015,homeless,"How we can adapt that to micro community for the homeless in [ORGANIZATION] would be to go ahead and build that exact community, except that half that money, approximately half that money, would not go to refinance the next micro community, but would pay the rent for the other half of the people that are going to stay there transitionally. So what we would have is a 50 percent of the folks paying the rent,  The other 50% receiving a free [STREET] to stay for a determined amount of time, whatever the caseworkers would think is appropriate to get them on their feet. This program, I believe, should not focus on the chronically homeless."
02_04_2015,homeless,"It should focus on the folks that are just on the verge of becoming homeless, that just need a little bit of help. They don't need [ORGANIZATION] of free rent. They just need a [STREET] to stay for a [LOCATION] or two while they move on to wherever they're going to move on to."
02_04_2015,homeless,"So this is not really a program for chronically homeless, but it certainly could be a project for chronically homeless. Yes. So initially, that one program at FAC0 and FAC1, we could build that for less than $1 million."
02_04_2015,homeless,"Have you put an offer to buy it? As soon as we finished our architect, finished his job, or other teams finished their jobs, we took it and presented it to [ORGANIZATION] homeless event, and within [ORGANIZATION] it was sold. So we're trying not to tell people where we're planning our projects because they have a tendency to sell quickly."
02_04_2015,homeless,"And we would like to talk to you privately about that as well. Okay, good. So we could, if you guys wanted to give us, say, in [ORGANIZATION] or [LOCATION], to come back and give you a presentation with all of us for a site-specific micro-community, specifically for the homeless issue, we could do that."
02_04_2015,homeless,"Not really, no. There really is no forum to come and talk about a new sort of micro-community. Micro-communities are new to begin with, let alone homeless micro-communities, low-income micro-communities."
02_04_2015,homeless,"That seems to complicate things quite a bit. So we think we could partner with the city on a homeless micro-community and set a precedence.  that other cities could easily replicate. In fact, we have a lot of other cities that are calling us and trying to find out about this."
02_04_2015,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION], I believe, is chairing that. It's on the homeless issue. We've had a meeting after meeting, committee after committee after committee."
02_04_2015,homeless,"I think we would be remiss if we didn't thank Commissioner [PERSON] for all her hard work on putting us in a better position to improve services at our parks and the voters also. I hope that since the recent homeless count happened, that there'll be some encouragement for [ORGANIZATION] and also the group working with FAC0,  to be realistic and honest about the fact that all over our city we have homeless people. And if there are not [TIME] facilities, they're going to take care of their business outdoors in the parks, even though the parks are technically closed."
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"At the outset of this hearing, I wanted to highlight an important part of this resolution that should provide some context for the testimony ahead. I know we'll hear about height issues in the central city, as well as transportation and sustainability challenges. But my goal here [ORGANIZATION] as [ORGANIZATION] is to make sure that we –  take some bold and vigorous steps to make sure that we provide for affordable housing in our central city and to do so in a [STREET] that will prevent our city from turning into [ORGANIZATION] where people on either end of the income scale can live, where you're either very rich or you're very poor, but nowhere in the middle."
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"And my goal, as well as that of [ORGANIZATION], is,  as they expressed in their deliberations on this quadrant plan, West Quadrant Plan, is to see that the central city accommodates people of affordable housing stock for people in the 0 to 80% of median income range. And that's something I very much agree with, but I also recognize that we lack  the financial resources to make that happen and we need to be creative and engage in some creative thinking uh for policy tools that will enable us to get there and I know that the both the ORG1 staff as well as the ORG2 staff the mayor staff and my staff and [ORGANIZATION] has signed off on coming up with incentives  for height or [PERSON] that are tied directly into creation of more affordable housing stock within the city, either creation of the affordable housing directly by whomever is developing the property or by paying into a housing investment fund, uh,  for an amount to be determined that will help us in turn generate that affordable housing stock."
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"But I just want to let people know now, because they can address this issue, that there is language in this resolution that,  And I'll read that language right there that talks about developing a substantive affordable housing bonus program. In the resolution, it says, be it further resolved, [ORGANIZATION] instructs [ORGANIZATION] and ORG2 to include a workable affordable housing bonus for ORG3 consideration in implementing code for the final FAC0 plan. So this is really a daunting challenge, but it's a challenge I know that this council is up for."
02_04_2015,affordable housing,I know we all recognize... The need for more affordable housing as does [ORGANIZATION] But we need to actualize we need to activate the tools that will get us there beyond simply [ORGANIZATION] renewal money or federal government money or other sources at our disposal So we need to be creative and we're going to be serious and creative about that in the [LOCATION] quadrant and the central city plan Thank you.
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"This just creates the possibility of potential.  possibly affording to relocate, making it worthwhile to reconsider the configuration of one of those or both of those ramps and be able to pay for it. The other thing about this, and this goes to a point that [ORGANIZATION] made very strongly, is that additional height here would be tied to a bonus. So you'd have to give something to get it, and as a waterfront location, it might have some particular value that can contribute to the affordable housing aspects of the bonus."
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"Okay, two more issues. Affordable housing. The [ORGANIZATION] plan set a goal of having 15 percent of the housing stock affordable citywide and currently over 30 percent of the housing in the central city is affordable at the 80 percent median family income or less."
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"So the [ORGANIZATION] set a very ambitious goal that by [ORGANIZATION], or in [ORGANIZATION], we're still going to have 30% of the housing in the central city affordable to 80% MFI or less households. The current city strategy targets affordable housing around opportunity areas, and the notion is that some of our neighborhoods are rich in transit, they're rich in good schools, they're rich in these things that for affordable housing areas,  residents, adds to likelihood of success and lowers their cost. And the planning commission sort of focused in on the fact that between the concentration of jobs and not just the concentration of jobs in general but the concentration of sort of working class jobs in the central city, concentration of transit, this is a great [STREET] to have affordable housing to save households money."
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"We talked about [PERSON], and we talked about the [ORGANIZATION] plan, and [ORGANIZATION], a whole community displaced. And we talked about a huge deficit in affordable housing. So I previewed this question to you before the hearing because I was sincerely interested in getting your response."
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"And I'm sure Commissioner [PERSON] is going to talk about that, too. So what I would really appreciate as we go through this is that you help us be as prescriptive as possible about what it's going to mean. Commissioner [PERSON] has put this voluntary bonus plan for affordable housing on the table."
02_04_2015,affordable housing,You've prioritized creating incentives for the development of family housing over preserving existing affordable housing. I don't know whether that's right. We know that a family housing is more expensive.
02_04_2015,affordable housing,I might want to preserve what we have because I suspect there's going to be a lot of pressure on the existing stock of affordable housing. And we know it takes an enormous focus to preserve preservation. vulnerable properties.
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"And I have to add, as an urban planning geek, this is a really exciting time. [ORGANIZATION] shares the city's goal for this area of [PERSON], to be a healthy, thriving, and sustainable community that provides family-wage jobs, affordable housing, and recreation areas for all members of our community. And I come to you with two particular lenses beyond that conceptual continuation of our forward-thinking land-use planning policies and the urban growth boundary."
02_04_2015,homelessness,"First, around housing more people in the core area. We support the plan's goals to allow for needed future residential development capacity for all income levels. As I mentioned, [ORGANIZATION], which is a partnership between cities of [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON], GPE2, [ORGANIZATION], and ORG2, is committed to providing an urgent and coordinated response to ending homelessness in our city and region."
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"Our region's low vacancy rate, increasing rents, and lack of tools to increase the supply of affordable housing makes this work extremely difficult, as you know. Not only is downtown an attractive [STREET] to build a wide range of housing options, it is also a great [STREET] to wrap around those kinds of housing support services that we need to support families and individuals. In addition...  [ORGANIZATION] owns many public buildings and provides many public services in this project area, and we also receive property taxes from private property in the area."
02_04_2015,homelessness,"And as we grow as a region over [ORGANIZATION], we know that well-designed, dense, mixed-use urban communities can promote livability, reduce transportation and housing costs, improve equity, and make our streets safer. And to Commissioner [PERSON]'s earlier point, they are also fundamental to our climate responsibilities. After the plan is adopted, [ORGANIZATION] looks forward to collaborating with the city on city-county priorities in the plan related to transportation, public safety, emergency management, housing and homelessness, and sustainability."
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"We did not necessarily debate how to prioritize at all, not at the [ORGANIZATION] level. there's still some topic areas that need to be addressed in the plan such as the [ORGANIZATION] parking bonus system and this work will continue and it will come together to in when we complete the central city plan therefore the ORG1 recommends moving this plan forward with approval of the resolution thank you thank you PERSON0 [PERSON] playing sustainability chair uh mayor council before you DATE0 it's a major component of moving our central city forward  What you will hear are policies of how our downtown skyline may change and look, the importance of historical preservation, stronger environmental policies, recognition that parts of our downtown districts have unique character and need to be relative to their culture,  and a reaffirming and elevation of the affordable housing in our central city. And I'm going to recap kind of the deliberations, I think, or the high points, and then I'd like to touch on housing and talk a little more about that."
02_04_2015,affordable housing,what will it take to get more affordable housing in our downtown core and as a commission as the chair of the [ORGANIZATION] I think we're committed and I tell you I'm committed to bringing back something to you that says this is how we think we can get there it's going to be a tool box it's not one I don't think there's a crescent wrench in there that solves this problem
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"If they go one by one, affordable housing and affordable offices will disappear, as well as the stories these buildings tell us.  us. We are in the middle of [ORGANIZATION]'s story. Without its beginning, the story will lose its shape and meaning, even its soul."
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"but make investors drool. Committed to high-rise, [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] now have the least affordable housing in the world and a deteriorating public realm. When you permit very high-rise buildings, the huge potential profits inflate land prices."
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"This jeopardizes historic buildings, [ORGANIZATION]'s heritage and historic identity and makes it increasingly difficult to ensure affordable market rate housing. And as research clearly demonstrates, high-rise is not suitable for many mothers, children, and elders, i.e., affordable housing. The supposed benefits for all income-level housing do not trickle down."
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I ask the council to lower the maximum building height to 100 feet or less in [ORGANIZATION] and to preserve the historic buildings there. Research has verified that neighborhoods made up of small-scale buildings...  combined with older buildings, provide two important things. They provide affordable office space and affordable housing."
02_04_2015,affordable housing,Affordable office space supports locally owned business. What local shop owner can afford to rent in a new 400-foot glass tower? Affordable housing attracts younger residents.
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"Not surprisingly, [ORGANIZATION]'s embrace of high towers was made possible by land use policies that attracted huge inflows of global monies, mostly from [ORGANIZATION]. Instead of fostering affordable housing and livable neighborhoods in [ORGANIZATION], this wave of high-rise construction created a glut of luxury housing for the very wealthy, many of them visitors from other lands,  and many occupying them only part-time. This oversupply of unaffordable housing has pushed ordinary [ORGANIZATION] citizens further into less affluent neighborhoods, including the city's downtrodden [PERSON], which is a druggy area."
02_04_2015,affordable housing,I'd be happy to share more of that with you. I do understand that tall buildings offer attractive profits.  particularly for affordable housing. That's a goal that I share very much as well.
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"But I think we have to recognize the dangers in this kind of supply-side economic strategy, deregulating so that the wealth will trickle down to the rest of the city and to affordable housing and the other things that we want to do. In many cities around the world, the results of this strategy have been, to put it bluntly, dismaying. Some of my own research for [ORGANIZATION] has documented how global capital is currently flooding into high-rise projects and profoundly changing the character of cities around the globe."
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"This is a neighborhood in an old-fashioned sense. I ask you to consider the treasured history of DATE0 GPE0 in [ORGANIZATION] existing buildings. Should the allowable heights specified in the draft FAC0 be adopted, the buildings that not only give the neighborhood character, but offer affordable housing to a large number of elderly on fixed incomes, [ORGANIZATION] students, and those of moderate means who work downtown, would over time give [STREET] to more costly housing and lead to gentrification."
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"We'll talk about it more. Third, affordable housing is not being addressed in the proposed plan. We've heard about that a lot too."
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"Is this dense housing? I think so. Third point, affordable housing is not being created or preserved in [ORGANIZATION]."
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"You've heard that a lot. The plan  The plan's housing goal is to preserve existing supply and continue to support development of existing housing, but there is nothing in the plan addressing preserving affordable housing and little substance to implement the goal other than developing tools to partner with the private development community. [ORGANIZATION]."
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"Evening, [ORGANIZATION].  good [TIME] mayor and commissioners um i'm [PERSON] i'm an architect uh past chair of [ORGANIZATION] and and also um a past architectural consultant to [ORGANIZATION] housing and community services regarding affordable housing um i have a couple of this this testimony uh strongly supports the adoption of the plan  with the following comments and conditions regarding specific aspects of livability as they apply to the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhoods. Mayor, in your State of the City address and in [ORGANIZATION]'s ORG1 interview, you mentioned height, bulk, and setbacks as important qualities of that compatibility."
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"Create attractive, dense, high-quality, affordable housing throughout the central city that accommodates a broad range of needs, preferences, and financial capability in terms of different types, tenures, size, costs, and locations. That's great. Here's the sentence that was struck, which would actually greatly increase the impact of housing policy on the city, especially [ORGANIZATION]."
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"provide a more diverse stock of housing to support a diversifying central city population that includes housing compatible with the needs of families with children, people with special needs, students, seniors, and the central city workforce. I believe that this is important language simply because it deals with more than the simplicity, overly simple aspect of providing so many units of affordable housing. It deals with size."
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"There are no Chinese people in Chinatown. And I don't see, I understand about motivating affordable housing. I'm all for that."
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"So when we're moving to commercial, we have to find the housing. I wonder if we could have a no net loss of affordable housing. Yeah."
01_26_2017,affordable housing,"Item 86, adopt [ORGANIZATION] [DATE] Action Plan and direct staff to implement the investment strategies and outcomes identified in the action plan. So this is coming from the [ORGANIZATION], and we have [ORGANIZATION] here and some others.  to testify, but I've been provided a couple of overview points that I'd like to go ahead and share. Over [ORGANIZATION] since [ORGANIZATION] was first established, many of the city's investments in [LOCATION] and [LOCATION]east have improved transportation infrastructure and transit access, revitalized neighborhood, and created new developments with both affordable housing and commercial developments."
01_26_2017,affordable housing,"So our planning for [ORGANIZATION] began soon after the [ORGANIZATION] lift, which increased the affordable housing set-aside from 30% to 45% citywide. The impact in [ORGANIZATION], as you might recall, is more significant in that the remaining resources are now divided 70-[ADDRESS]. So 70% now goes to affordable housing, and 30% is available for other business and community development objectives."
01_26_2017,affordable housing,"So you see here a reflection of the investments over [ORGANIZATION] where 73% or about $108 million will go into set-aside policy affordable housing and about 27% will go into business development, redevelopment, and infrastructure. This is in recognition of the fact that you have serious affordability challenges in this district, and so this is the area where we're seeing the most significant increase within the urban renewal area. So by the time the [ORGANIZATION] spending is completed, 50% of expenditures will have been invested in affordable housing and 50% to other development priorities."
01_26_2017,affordable housing,"Thank you. And so within that program, it would be the expansion of the down payment assistance, also the expansion of single-family home repair,  And also expanded proposing a program by [ORGANIZATION] to support the development of accessory dwelling units and cottage homes to those with incomes between [ADDRESS] to begin to support multi-generational families."
01_26_2017,affordable housing,"And so those dollars play out to be $1.6 million that would go towards down payment assistance, $1.6 million that would go towards the single-family home repair program, and then $1.8 million to go towards a proposed program to help with accessory dwelling units. Are there any structural or sideboards on particularly accessory dwelling units for obviously –  If they're rented out for [ORGANIZATION], that's more income for the homeowner, but it's also not really increasing our supply of affordable housing. So did you have some of those discussions in this, [ORGANIZATION]?"
01_26_2017,homeless,"When Commissioner [PERSON] mentioned [ORGANIZATION] over in [ORGANIZATION] area, I named my nonprofit organization [ORGANIZATION].  [PERSON] because there are so many homeless people that are good people, but they've had a divorce. They've lost a job. They've gotten on drugs."
01_26_2017,homelessness,"Well, it was disappointing to me that none of the people who were yelling at us [ORGANIZATION] for doing nothing about housing and homelessness are not here, and particularly to hear that $32 million is not a lot of money. It is actually. And the $146.7 million over [LOCATION]."
01_10_2018,homeless,"It appears to me that the council is attempting to change the laws of physics by stating a home floating on a river is an impervious surface. Specifically around the roof, yes, but everything that falls on the roof immediately goes into the river. Raising the costs of homeownership and renters, many who are on fixed incomes, will only make the problem of the ongoing homeless crisis worse, as many of these people are being directly impacted by this raise."
01_07_2015,homeless,"Number four. Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel regarding homeless issues. Ms. [PERSON], come on up."
01_07_2015,homelessness,"I thought you were gonna talk about a blue ribbon committee. That was the low-hanging fruit Let's let's move on to time certain number six  [ORGANIZATION] subrecipient contract with [ORGANIZATION] for $492,273 for housing vulnerable adults and outreach and housing placement to veterans and people experiencing homelessness in [ORGANIZATION] east of the [PERSON] city limits. And could you also read 7 and [DATE] as well?"
01_07_2015,homeless,"7, authorize subrecipient contract with [ORGANIZATION] for $110,000 for housing placement services for women  And number eight, amend intergovernmental agreement with [ORGANIZATION] for $355,000 for the homeless family system of care program. Commissioner [PERSON]. Thank you, Mr. [PERSON]."
01_07_2015,homelessness,"In [ORGANIZATION] budget, [ORGANIZATION] allocated an additional $500,000 in new ongoing funds to additional services for people experiencing homelessness. Through a competitive process...  which emphasized the priority populations identified in a home for everyone, including women, families, vulnerable adults, and veterans, as well as increasing access for people of color, three programs were selected for funding. The first is [ORGANIZATION], which will work with ORG2, [PERSON], [LOCATION], and [ORGANIZATION],  to transition [ADDRESS] into permanent housing."
01_07_2015,homeless,"The second is [ORGANIZATION]. We will build on its success of partnerships that it has, which rely heavily on culturally specific providers to move 66 households into permanent housing, including 15 who have experienced domestic violence. The third investment is [PERSON] and ORG2, which will continue their innovative partnership with ORG3  to permanently house 38 individuals."
01_07_2015,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] is a ORG1 program that places homeless, non-parenting women in permanent housing and then offers ongoing support for housing retention and community engagement. Our program operates a [ORGANIZATION] drop-in center, women only, where women can access basic services like showers and laundry and food. It's also where we begin our relationship building with people so that we house them and have an ongoing relationship with them for often DATE1."
01_07_2015,homeless,"Through this initiative, housing transitions will be able to [STREET] at least 10 older homeless women in permanent housing, and [ORGANIZATION] will ensure their ability to have income, provide valuable assistance to other community programs, and to maintain their housing on their own. ORG1 engages faith communities in providing programs and services to formerly homeless individuals. We have partnered with ORG2 in our [PERSON] program, which engages volunteers to provide practical assistance and health information to formerly homeless individuals and to improve their overall health, and also to engage in community after placement."
01_07_2015,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] provides volunteer-driven social activities, giving the women a richer life, reducing the isolation women often experience after moving indoors, and enhancing housing retention. [ORGANIZATION] expects to house at least 40 homeless women through this initiative, and we're so grateful to you for giving us the opportunity to do so. Thank you."
01_07_2015,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION], you want to talk about the homeless family system? Yes. Well, good morning, and we want to actually thank you so very much for this opportunity."
01_07_2015,homeless,"Not only [ORGANIZATION], but [PERSON], ORG2, [PERSON], [LOCATION]. Goodness, am I forgetting something? No, I'm not."
01_07_2015,homelessness,"That's it, I think. Anyway, we're all just very, very excited about the opportunity. There are so many, especially communities of color, that struggle with homelessness, and in such a [STREET] that it's a little bit different."
01_07_2015,homeless,"he had something on his record and and our one of our homeless team members was able to you know make communication with that district and talk to him about the situation and ask them to if they could reduce the feed to so that they could pay the fee and be able to let that go and get his id and get his get be able to get into housing it was an amazing thing that it just took [ORGANIZATION]  for them to be able to do that. And that's something we didn't even think about that could happen, but this is the things that our mobile housing team are thinking about, like how do we do this? How do we eliminate problems that are legal issues or that are back rent from who knows when or something that happened [DATE] to help these families get into housing?"
01_07_2015,homeless,How do I explain this situation? And sometimes this is obviously with families who have never been homeless in their lives and they didn't know what to do next. So it's a really amazing opportunity to have all of these team members working together and figuring out how do we best serve the people in the city of [ORGANIZATION].
01_07_2015,homeless,"To date, going back to the origins of this funding, we've helped [ADDRESS] and into stable housing. Those are safe places where they can explore other interests and add value to their life. And I'd like to share a story of one individual who,  man named [PERSON] who's been homeless for or had been homeless for [ORGANIZATION] in inner [ORGANIZATION] regular at st [PERSON] dining hall we'd connected with him [PERSON] and I  The extent of his challenges were so pervasive that about all he could remember day to day was the name of his joint outreach worker."
01_07_2015,homeless,"He was preyed upon repeatedly, and as that victim of crime had so many interactions with public safety, and it's something that we don't normally think about in terms of how homeless people interact with public safety. They're victims of crime as well. And so using funding in this initiative, we were able to connect with a [ORGANIZATION] mental health worker who was then able to leverage [ORGANIZATION]'s other resources around mental health services and find him placement at [ORGANIZATION], where he's able to access really supportive community group therapies and services."
01_07_2015,homeless,"Some of our chronic homeless and camping issues, I can still vividly remember [TIME] being at FAC0 issuing multiple citations and taking a very enforcement approach at that time with very little consideration about where do people go or where do they need to go and how are their needs met. And I'm embarrassed by that because I think that was out of ignorance on my part. Thank you."
01_07_2015,homelessness,"to not only get people into housing and the story of [ORGANIZATION] that we just heard and so many others, which I can relate on a personal level from our officers' experience, but I'm now able to direct our officers who are trying to balance community needs, criminal behavior with also people that are just in need of assistance or experiencing homelessness or mental health or drug and alcohol addiction, all the things that play into this. We're able to actually provide resources. DATE0 when I was out there, I didn't have any idea who existed and where to direct people."
01_07_2015,homeless,"The homeless family system operates countywide. All right, but then why do you have city limits in there?"
01_07_2015,homeless,"Again, Commissioner [PERSON], I want to commend you on your efforts on this. Any money directed toward the homeless situation is positive in this city or [ORGANIZATION]. A concern I had originally on this is just to make sure that the funds for [ORGANIZATION], since they do also have a surplus...  are being paid from [ORGANIZATION] on the east side where it's necessary to do that."
01_07_2015,homeless,We're making great changes pertaining to the homeless. I think we're making great strides. I think that we need to keep focusing on the addictions that a lot of people do have and  We need to offer better treatment.
01_07_2015,homeless,I want it focused on the suicide prevention aspect of this. We need to understand that a high percentage of homeless people that are heroin addicts do commit suicide. It goes down the list of meth addicts.
01_07_2015,homelessness,"They've been displaced out of their homes, from their jobs, from their friends, and when they're out on the sidewalks, out on the streets, they're looking for more positive solutions, which the speakers have stated they want to go in that direction. Again, Mayor, I'm going to compliment you on the bigger picture of homelessness because I was listening to a, it's called [ORGANIZATION]. It's where some of the founders of certain companies in other states go and have discussions."
01_07_2015,homeless; homelessness; affordable housing,"And [ORGANIZATION] from [ORGANIZATION] at that meeting said that because of Mayor [PERSON], I'm looking at doing more things toward affordable housing and also the most vulnerable people in the city. That is the biggest direction that we need to have is people coming into this city, understanding if we talk shared economy, we need to also understand the homeless communities are part of the economy, and you begin to share that responsibility also. That's what was stated, and if we can continue to do that from the get-go, we're going to end chronic homelessness in this city, and we will maintain chronic homelessness.  chronic homelessness from [ORGANIZATION] and let these other services step in and provide the service they need."
01_07_2015,homelessness,Ending chronic homelessness can be a reality with the right people brought in and the right resources from these other companies that are billion-dollar companies coming into this city and stating that they're listening to you close on the issues of homelessness. Thank you. Could you give us afterwards the reference to where this gentleman –  said what you've just quoted?
01_07_2015,homelessness,"He stated that as a direction he'd like to look into to be part of the solutions through this city. There's no other commitments there, and I respect that he's at least thinking about it, looking at it, and determining how they want to spend the resources in this city. That changes the whole dynamics of homelessness through this city to have people do that before they enter with their businesses."
01_07_2015,affordable housing,"Well, Commissioner [PERSON] has proposed we take 100 percent of the revenue from [ORGANIZATION] and we address affordable housing, which I support. And if the president of the company believes he wants to use some of his revenues –  to help address affordable housing, I think we could potentially have a marriage made in heaven. So I'll pull it up."
01_07_2015,homelessness,"Your numbers might be a little bit high, but their intent to look at it and address those issues is one of the most positive things that we can have going forward in this city. And it will change the dynamics of ending chronic homelessness. Thank you."
01_07_2015,homeless,"My name is [ORGANIZATION]. And I don't know which is a more contentious phrase around here, [ORGANIZATION] or [ORGANIZATION] versus the city of [PERSON] for the conduct of the [PERSON] [INSTITUTION]. But it was encouraging to hear the officers' words about improvements in interactions with homeless people and people in distress here."
01_07_2015,homelessness,"Obviously, these funds need to be released. You need to vote yes on these items. We need to have a more comprehensive number and fact-based discussion that what happens with [ORGANIZATION] or [PERSON] at ORG2 and [PERSON] and [LOCATION] and [ORGANIZATION]."
01_07_2015,homeless; homelessness,"I would like to address a few issues that I see, and what I see is from certain enforcement individuals, a culture of hate against people that are experiencing homelessness. And there's a brutality that is used to intimidate people  and more or less, I don't like to use the word, but terrorize people that are homeless. And I see this, and I see the effects of this, and this is not good."
01_07_2015,homeless,But this has to stop. And I would also like to say that we should make it a hate crime for anybody to beat up on homeless people just because they're homeless. Yes.
01_07_2015,homeless,"Money to the homeless, you know, it's not going to hurt them. There's certain things that people know what to do with money, and money is a shortage right now for people. People aren't going to be clamoring over the borders trying to get over here because it's so good for homeless folks."
01_07_2015,affordable housing,"So we're not likely to see more federal dollars, and that's one of the reasons why I will support Commissioner [PERSON]'s proposal in the regular budget that we take $[ADDRESS] we're going to solve this problem is to increase the supply of affordable housing. There is a shortage. We must attack it from the point of view of adding to the supply, and I think [PERSON] has the right idea with the [ORGANIZATION], and I will support that during the budget cycle."
01_07_2015,homelessness; houseless,"And when it's been pointed out that Commissioner [PERSON], who many of us think is sometimes being too pro-business, is honest and sincere enough to say, there's a supply problem, we have to make housing. So without talking to the latest concerns about  the budget overruns. I do want to say if we have massive 300% budget overruns or 200% budget overruns, I hope they always happen in providing homelessness to houseless and underhoused people in the future instead of [ORGANIZATION]."
01_07_2015,houseless,"We need people on the ground engaging people where they are. That means where houseless people are, where grassroots African-American youth are hanging out. And I love Judge [PERSON], but I don't think he's a grassroots outreach person."
01_13_2016,homeless,And they're homeless. And they're sick. And they're sicker.
01_13_2016,affordable housing,"I think there's a lot that [ORGANIZATION] can do to help affordable housing more than has happened so far. So I hope that there's a role for the commission on that. And also a little thank you to our partners who are with us here, because this is a lot of time commitment."
01_13_2016,affordable housing,Thank you.  very smart people. I think [ORGANIZATION] has provided me with lots of insights on how our comp plan can support affordable housing. And I hope we will address some of those issues when we adopt the comp plan.
01_13_2016,homelessness,"So I think Judge [PERSON] has been very helpful in this latest decision, protecting First Amendment rights. There are a lot of things that the public can disagree on because if you're taking three-quarters of Americans are now paycheck to paycheck, three-quarters of Americans close to homelessness. I understand the pressures that you're under."
01_13_2016,housing crisis,"So we are not actually addressing the documented area of need in our housing crisis, which is why I hope the legislature gives us the flexibility to address inclusionary housing. And I hope we don't take our eye off of...  providing housing for people that we have clear evidence they're being priced out of the marketplace, and that is certainly well below 80% MFI. Thank you."
01_13_2016,affordable housing,"Thank you, [ORGANIZATION], for really being a bulldog around getting the multi-program to work. And that includes the amendments you brought to council to respond to some concerns we had from the development community. this is one of our most important tools and frankly it's not just an affordability tool it's a fair housing tool to ensure that we put affordable housing in high opportunity areas so thank you for your work on this PERSON1"
01_13_2016,affordable housing,"So by incorporation,  Encouraging this upzoning and the demolition, you're actually destroying density. You're losing affordable housing, and you're also losing this wonderful mix of historic structures that span a period from [ORGANIZATION] to have a monoculture of our 2.5 single-family houses, $700,000, 3,000 square feet plus. So the new zoning will encourage demolitions and is at odds with a determination of eligibility and a potential viable historic district, and with Goal 5 of [ORGANIZATION], which asks to conserve historic areas."
01_13_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"In my opinion, the most critical issue in [ORGANIZATION] is that development is out of control. This is what is creating a lack of affordable housing and adding to homelessness. While development can be good for the city and create employment, uncontrolled development is not."
01_13_2016,affordable housing,"There's all kinds of property that could be developed now. There's some money coming through for affordable housing. If you have to do an incentive to get some builders out there in that far reach of [ORGANIZATION], do it."
01_13_2016,affordable housing,"If we don't get affordable housing, we're going to end up with a –  an exodus from [ORGANIZATION] that will mean we don't need those 300,000 rent units for people to live in because it's becoming unlivable, as you know, if you attended the concern about housing and lack of it. Think that apartments can be built and occupied within [ORGANIZATION] on FAC0 FAC1, [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]. And now that those funds are available, please use them to develop affordable housing in an area that is waiting for it and ready for it, [PERSON]."
01_13_2016,unhoused,And please leave our historic districts unhoused. so that they maintain their beauty and their history. Five stories in the midst of two one-story retail buildings with no retail and no parking is an abomination.
01_13_2016,affordable housing,"Goal 5D, affordable housing. And 5E, high performance housing. Our little homes are very efficient and have a very minimal carbon footprint."
01_13_2016,housing crisis,"Hi, my name is [ORGANIZATION], and I have rented in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood for [ORGANIZATION]. In fact, 80% of my neighbors rent here  Nevertheless, [ORGANIZATION] and much of [PERSON] is experiencing a housing crisis with record low vacancy rates and an epidemic of displacement of long-term residents. As a renter threatened by displacement myself, I strongly support upzoning of plots adjacent to centers and quarters in the [ORGANIZATION] area,  and the inner southeast as a whole."
01_13_2016,affordable housing,"You heard about the issues we've had with south of FAC0 before, and our main issues besides that would be that we would consider affordable housing impact statements as a policy, perhaps 5.45%. PERSON0, this is a very useful thing. [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], [PERSON] are all using these impact statements as a [STREET] of mechanism of implementing affordable housing and the policies that are in this document."
01_13_2016,homeless,"It's a good, viable system, and it helps even homeless and wayward, not wayward travelers, but people along the freeway. During the snowstorm, other things happen too, and therein lies the plot. I'm a nurse, a former ORG0 nurse."
01_14_2015,affordable housing,"So here we're coming into legal cannabis in [ORGANIZATION]. I'm a little bit miffed that my [ORGANIZATION] research was destroyed by my non-profit affordable housing landlord you're partnering with, Commissioner [PERSON]. Halt at the dump.  along with my registered medical [PERSON]."
01_14_2015,affordable housing,"Affordable housing, nonprofit landlord has been keeping the apartment that they destroyed my research illegally. And you're partnering with the mayor? How am I supposed to feel good about this?"
01_14_2015,homeless,"I'm PERSON0. I'm the Business Operations Manager for [ORGANIZATION], and I'm going to talk to you about our innovation project. Ours is about assisting homeless families"
01_14_2015,homeless,"So our city has hundreds of homeless assistance programs operating on [ORGANIZATION]. Faith-based organizations are about a third of these programs, including the majority of food and substantial portion of all shelter and drop-in services. For example, at our faith-based summit that we had in [LOCATION], we had 15 churches participate."
01_14_2015,homeless,"Eight of those churches do hunger and food services on a [ORGANIZATION] basis, and nine of them provide some type of homeless service, either clothing, shelter, letting families park in their parking lots, a variety of things, which if we had not had that summit, we would not have known about what the services are. So despite the long history of them helping people in need, we know very little about what they're doing. And they serve primarily a diverse population."
01_14_2015,homeless,"Faith-based organizations have historically steered clear government because we require a lot of restraints and a lot of rules and things that they don't generally feel like they should have to –  to do in order to provide help to people. This innovation project aims to couple the specialized care and commitment provided by faith-based organizations serving the homeless with city services and housing resources. As part of the proposal, we'll appoint a staff member as a faith-based liaison to work with churches to develop a data and information sharing program."
01_14_2015,homelessness,"And this second portion was recommended by [ORGANIZATION], who was working with the city on the ORG1 projects [ORGANIZATION]. This project aims to create a new relationship contributing new information to the city's efforts to reduce and end homelessness. It will contribute new knowledge about the needs of [ORGANIZATION] residents and the strategies to best meet those needs."
01_14_2015,homeless; homelessness,"So that's a fair answer. Now, one of the things that I like about this, and I'm referring mainly on the homelessness on the data sharing, what I'd like to see possibly is more data on more of a [ORGANIZATION] count of people that are homeless, say, on a [LOCATION] basis out through the city. But why I mention that is I want to see more of a,  maybe a more of a sophisticated system set up to where we really monitor that number."
01_14_2015,homeless,"And I'm talking about where people get their food, if they're chronically homeless outside. I want to have that data to really understand that number, how it's changing, how it's changing with the population, with people moving out of the state, people moving into the state, etc.  I really want that number to even be broken down to central downtown, east side, certain areas by the block. I want that number accessed."
01_14_2015,homelessness,"PERSON0? Good [TIME], Commissioners. I'm glad that [PERSON] retouched on the issue of –  homelessness."
01_14_2015,homeless,"I know that it's a difficult issue for to find funding in places, you know, there are federal restrictions. We really, we kind of know that we just need more units and Commissioner [PERSON] and all of you have worked to take steps in that direction. [TIME] I was particularly aware of which doorways already had people asleep prior towards [TIME] and I hope that  [ORGANIZATION] we might have some capacity to directly approach people and engage, have a facility where we can actually rescue people and actually just accost people and actually be glad that some homeless people, all they want to do is rest."
01_14_2015,homeless,"He's not the chief, and I don't have his card. I have a couple other people's information that I gathered. But I was concerned because I live in a downtown [ORGANIZATION] area, and there are a lot of homeless people that live in that area that I live in, and I think I proposed to you to really come out there on the streets and hang out with me for a [ORGANIZATION] or two."
01_14_2015,homelessness,"I think everything happened for a reason in this life. If I had not been there for her and her being there for me, I wouldn't still be here because she was the person that encouraged me to continue to keep going with this movement. And as I've been a part of it, it's just been so many touching factors to what's going on with our population of people of homelessness, of mental illness, and all of these different things in [ORGANIZATION]."
01_14_2015,homeless,"And it's just so hurtful that I'm collecting data. I'm advocating for homeless people at this point. And I'm setting up a space for them to come because they're not going to come down here with all their luggage and everything that they have, you know, to talk to someone that they don't know that really haven't done nothing for them."
01_14_2015,homeless; homelessness,"And there's several pictures. I'm compiling a documentary about the homeless people,  you know the hiddenness behind homelessness and it's not always about a person being an addict you know people want help in this city but if they're having to be out on the [STREET] and women have to get with the man that they don't know just to have a pallet to lay down and i could get to go to a warm bed [TIME] mayor that's not right for me thank you so much for being here and for coming forward and being an advocate thank you"
01_09_2019,houseless,"DATE0, I've learned a lot in [LOCATION] because I'm now more involved with helping friends in [ORGANIZATION]. What I learned...  ever since a couple city councils ago, was that the new response is that a notice will be posted in a certain amount of time before any houseless camp is swept away. Before DATE2, there was supposed to be a sweep [DATE] before DATE2 in [ORGANIZATION]."
01_09_2019,homeless,"Thank you. Thank you. Okay, what I want to say is the hallmarks of this project where you go in and you consult with the property owners, they are afforded –  that homeless people are not, and that is the right to be seen as a person before the law."
01_09_2019,homeless,"And when you're confronted with an engineering problem and transportation is very important and how it's all done is very important and how it affects people is very important, when you're talking about  social services and lack of housing and things that impact the homeless, you don't consult the homeless to find out what's going on with them and where the rubber is not meeting the [STREET] or how they're affected. And [ORGANIZATION]  If you do not know where I was [ORGANIZATION] and what I was doing, you won't know what I was talking about, but I went up to your office on [LOCATION] and I left a detailed record."
01_09_2019,homeless,"And I'm talking about...  homeless people who are affected by the services that don't exist or do  exist on paper but don't exist in reality and just the dysfunction of that. And here you were able to work with the property owners. If you worked more with homeless people in terms of directly in conversation with them about what works and what doesn't and what's on paper that  pretends to be there and is not there, you would have a more functional system."
01_09_2019,homeless,"Like, you got this system to work because you consulted the property owners. If you don't talk directly with homeless people, you're never going to fix the homeless problem. So [ORGANIZATION] might be surprised to hear, and thank you for your testimony, you might be surprised to hear I agree with you"
01_09_2019,homelessness,"And I do, in fact, spend a considerable amount of time meeting with, talking with, sharing, going to, and being present to understand the situation of people who are directly impacted by homelessness. So I appreciate that. I can, you know, if you read what I wrote to you, my written communication, you will see that services are called, you know, at the exact time and under the exact condition that are prescribed, and they do absolutely nothing."
01_09_2019,affordable housing,"Thank you. And then...  In a desire to also try to talk in plain English, the advantage that we would have is that we could possibly build more affordable housing or use the other resources that we have. We'll have more resources that we could then invest, right?"
01_09_2019,affordable housing,"As a result of that, and as a result of some advocacy by people like [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] and others,  We actually got a more robust investment in affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION], which was one of the dividends. But we also made a commitment to continue to partner with [ORGANIZATION] on shared use facilities. And an issue that I believe predated all of us on council was the urban center.  which was put together by very creative people in terms of financing and had money from all kinds of different pots."
01_09_2019,homeless,"I'm not the biggest enthusiasm of everybody that lives in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood, but any low-income people that live in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood, if they're going to get anything out of this, they should have access to an expanded community garden on these grounds that we're displacing homeless people from,  During, well, the talk is happening now, during [ORGANIZATION] when we're going to have the [STREET] and time count, and find out that what we have failed to do is keep this homeless village situated where it should have remained and increase the number of homeless villages throughout the city so we have less tarps being blown around in windstorms like we experienced [LOCATION], etc., As to whether there might be offered bicycle use there or something like that and costs, I think that given the location of the facility, if we're going to have any talk about any other use other than an expanded community garden for people in the overlooked neighborhood area and anybody that wants to commute to that area along the bike path,  you know, any funding for fancy bike uses or whatever, which should be a conversation that really comes after either [ORGANIZATION] or [PERSON] have talked to us about how much money they're willing to name this path [PERSON]. If they don't want to spend money to name it [PERSON], then it's just going to be a multi-use path that helps people get to community gardens."
01_17_2018,homeless,"And you want to know why that affects everybody, and it affects everyone. It's not just a homeless problem. I did a little bit of research here."
01_17_2018,homeless,"Okay? And like I said, it's not just a homeless problem. Hepatitis C is going, or [ORGANIZATION] is going crazy in [ORGANIZATION]."
01_17_2018,homeless,"They're fining people for feeding homeless people because they think that that's the problem. It starts there, but it spreads to the whole community. DATE0 I took a little survey of five homeless people, and they all said the showers down at FAC0 is the number one [STREET] where they're able to take showers."
01_17_2018,homeless,"You know, our city would be healthier and happier if we were able to provide this care for everyone in the community, not just, you know, homeless. But what if we have immigrants that come into our city and need extra help? You know, this needs to be open to everyone in the community."
01_17_2018,homeless,"I'm very married to this issue. You know, I've been homeless since [ORGANIZATION], almost by choice. I don't have a criminal record."
01_17_2018,homeless,"I'm not an alcoholic. I'm not a drug addict. I was disabled from [ORGANIZATION], and so that's why I ended up being homeless."
01_17_2018,homeless,"You know, I don't make enough income to pay for a rental or a room, but I fight every day to survive. And, you know, I'm so tired of the lack of dignity that is shown to the homeless community. And we are a community."
01_17_2018,homeless,"And just to underscore, I want to let you know we're also looking at piloting with private sector help some of the mobile units that [ORGANIZATION] is now experimenting with, in particular in [PERSON], both mobile shower units as well as mobile bathroom units. And what they're doing down there is they're taking their prototypes around to areas where homeless folks are known to congregate, and they're effectively measuring the results in the community. So we're very interested in that kind of a pilot here as well."
02_07_2018,homeless; houseless,"They wanted it mentioned that homeless folks take up space, so they will be occupying public land. The question is whether or not they will do so to the city's benefit or the city's detriment. FAC0 provides an opportunity for houseless folks to give back to the community that they live in."
02_07_2018,affordable housing,"They have no [STREET] to do that when they're sleeping on a sidewalk, when they're scrambling to find a pallet or a tent or blankets that are dry. They have no [STREET] to do that when they're standing in line for shelters that may never open. They have no [STREET] to do that while they sit around waiting for you to figure out what affordable housing actually means and enforce that when developers come in and try to take over communities."
02_07_2018,houseless,"They have no [STREET] to do that while you still have no plan to really tackle the problem of increasing rents. They have no [STREET] to do that when they're busy trying to field off all the illnesses that come with being houseless and all the things that make them vulnerable. Running from cops, running from other people who would abuse them because of how vulnerable they are."
02_07_2018,affordable housing,[ORGANIZATION] is doing an affordable housing bond of $500 million. Okay. That's being proposed at this time.
02_07_2018,homeless,"Hi, my name is [ORGANIZATION], and like her, I'm a parent. My kids have been in the program for [ORGANIZATION], and...  I had a rocky start. When I first found out about the program through another person who finished, I was actually homeless living out of the car with my kids."
02_07_2018,homelessness,"I'm the first one to [STREET] and to have my license and pretty much do anything legitimately in my family. Growing up and coming from homelessness as a child, this has all just been a huge success. With the support that I've received from the program, it's helped me get all the [STREET] here."
02_07_2018,houseless,"We don't need to take care of our houseless community. And what my question is, is where does that divide come from? How do we pretend or how do we continue to pretend that we're like a third world country where we get to say, well, we only have...  the ways and means or the money to do this, but we don't have the ways and means because of something, X factor, to take care of our houseless community directly."
02_07_2018,homeless,"That's fine. We actually, if you look at the dollars that we are spending on youth,  and compare those dollars to the dollars we are spending on the homeless situation, prevention, shelter, housing, mental health services, behavioral health services, addiction services, job training, the resources going to children is a tiny fraction. Just for a home for everyone [ORGANIZATION] was about $28 million."
02_07_2018,homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION]Q youth have few role models to look up to at a time when the federal administration is working to dismantle our progress on [ORGANIZATION] equality by undermining transgender equality, inclusion in the armed services, and the freedom to marry. Naming a [STREET] after an [ORGANIZATION]Q hero sends a powerful message to our youth who still face alarming rates of bullying, family rejection, and homelessness. It sends a message that you're okay, you were born perfect, and there is nothing wrong with you."
02_07_2018,homeless,"We're talking about money we don't have to help the homeless and how we don't have enough to spread around with children's levy. So I want to remind you that changing a [STREET] is a huge expense, for one."
02_07_2018,housing crisis; affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] has been [DATE] for [ORGANIZATION], and specifically for the [ORGANIZATION] board, which we've had the opportunity to engage with the city and others on a lot of important and timely tasks. First, in terms of board membership,  We work to better reflect our community and to address the pressing needs related to the housing crisis by adding several board members with backgrounds in affordable housing, including an affordable housing provider in ORG2. We continually are looking to broaden our board membership to better reflect our community."
02_07_2018,affordable housing,"Importantly, is the connection between streetcar and housing and specifically affordable housing, and I showed this chart DATE0 but I think it's worth showing again, that our success is directly tied to the success of the city and the success of housing investments in the city. Every time we add a housing unit along the streetcar line, our ridership goes up on a one-to-one basis."
02_07_2018,affordable housing,"And [ORGANIZATION], 54% of all the housing built in [ORGANIZATION] was built on the streetcar line. And since we opened in [LOCATION], 49% of all the housing in [ORGANIZATION] has been opened on the streetcar line. That includes the city's largest investment in DATE2 of FAC0, where we're adding 240 units of affordable housing with the city's assistance."
02_07_2018,affordable housing,So very much supporting the lives of people choosing to live downtown and get to work and do shopping. We talked about affordable housing earlier. Important to note that more than one-third of all affordable housing units in the city are directly on [ORGANIZATION].
02_07_2018,homeless,"You know, in a [TIME] conversation here. I forgot how I was going to link this to [ORGANIZATION], and I guess we'll forget about that one, except it's using a vacant land and then selling it. I am kind of weird, though, about, I'll stretch it, it'll be an unrealistic topic, about homeless people not monitored in a camp."
02_07_2018,homeless,"I could have been stabbed. Well, what's going on here, in a more monitored situation with homeless people or homeless encampments, these things might not happen, where you have homeless people just kind of loosely around, doing things in the corner, stabbing each other or whatever. Of course, maybe these were two businessmen stabbing each other, but I doubt it."
02_07_2018,affordable housing,"As you know, [ORGANIZATION] is now one of the top 25 largest cities in the country, as well as once again the number one city to relocate to, and rightfully so. It's beautiful and it has a lot to offer. As a human resources professional, I hear on a regular basis the challenges individuals face with their families in mind in finding quality and affordable housing in or close to the City of [ORGANIZATION]."
02_07_2018,affordable housing,"if... I do want to say I'm disappointed to hear that multifamily was rejected. If we are going to have a sincere conversation about affordable housing and increasing our housing stock and density, then multifamily shouldn't be off the table, but frankly, $750,000, 3,500-square-foot homes are...  are not going to help either."
02_07_2018,housing crisis; affordable housing,"Now, I would like to see a multifamily option considered as much as anybody else because it does speak more to the affordable housing crisis. But as I said earlier, homeownership is a good thing, period, for people to be able to live near where they work. So that's where I'm coming down."
01_24_2018,affordable housing,"That process ended up with the parking toolkit and some recommendations about area parking permit program. In [ORGANIZATION], we met with the committee and we –  worked on the recommendations that are before you. And in [LOCATION], if you recall, as part of the comprehensive plan amendment and the zoning code amendment, we amended the code again to basically effectively eliminate minimum parking requirements in the area of good transit service by excluding units with affordable housing."
01_24_2018,affordable housing,This policy supports efforts in the [ORGANIZATION] plan and in the inclusionary housing policy and upcoming housing policy to build more affordable housing and to meet our climate goals. This is a foundation. Parking policy is really important to make sure that we don't have to spend a lot of money on building structured parking and to make sure that people can get by on the streets without too much traffic.
01_24_2018,affordable housing,"So [PERSON] is right. If you sign off on something like that, you're creating the problem. And the issue with that is that in neighborhoods that are already being extremely heavily gentrified, and the cost of housing is skyrocketing, and the residential infill project does not contain contingencies for actual affordable housing, which [ORGANIZATION], you've pointed out before with certain projects of building in the city is a constant issue."
01_24_2018,affordable housing,"It's handled by the same department that wrote the ticket to begin with, which is handled by the city that created the problem to begin with. So it's like you're adding the salt to the wound for those that are being gentrified out, for those whose neighborhoods are being taken over by this density project. Because you're not having contingencies for the affordable housing to ensure that people are not going to be kicked out and unable to afford to live there."
01_24_2018,affordable housing,"Right now, I didn't see anything about any kind of transparency so that we can see what's actually going on, other than the fact that they came in here and did a slideshow with print that was too small for everybody to see. And I see the problem with this is that  [ORGANIZATION], this city decided that it was going to be okay for all developers building buildings to house people that were even sometimes affordable housing by themselves. definition, that they were allowed to build without having parking in those buildings."
01_24_2018,houseless,There's not an emergency plan. For the houseless. It's been raining for [ORGANIZATION].
01_24_2018,houseless,"It's going to continue raining for [ORGANIZATION]. The houseless are outside, and I and [ORGANIZATION] and others have supplies for them in our cars. It's wrong."
02_02_2017,affordable housing,"It goes to [ORGANIZATION] as well as ORG1. What it seeks to do is reduce the cost, the time required. and any, for lack of a better word, hassle factor associated with bringing affordable housing online in the city of [ORGANIZATION]."
02_02_2017,affordable housing,"Thank you. item 105 amend affordable housing preservation and portland renter protections to add relocation assistance for involuntary displacements of tenants commissioner [ORGANIZATION] thank you mayor colleagues community members and special guests thank you for joining us [ORGANIZATION] to hear testimony on this relocation emergency ordinance  First, some housekeeping items. Parents and care providers, we've set up a childcare room on the third floor with snacks and crafts."
02_02_2017,affordable housing,I've been living and breathing affordable housing and tenants rights issues for [ORGANIZATION]. It's what inspired me to run for [ORGANIZATION] and is in no small part why I was elected. Because the fact is the majority of Portlanders support rent stabilization and increasing tenant protections.
02_02_2017,housing crisis,Some people have asked me what's the rush on this ordinance. The fact is members of my team were working on relocation for [ORGANIZATION] before we took office. and this housing crisis has been growing for [LOCATION].
02_02_2017,homelessness; affordable housing,"And now we're asking them to share in the burden that has been wrought on our residents, our communities, our city, and our entire region. The fact is we're all paying for this crisis, whether it's through the public dollars we spend on affordable housing, rental assistance, and homelessness, or the various ways that this crisis is harming our neighborhoods, communities, schools, small businesses, local economy, and the overall quality of life for all of our residents. As former Secretary of [ORGANIZATION] recently said, governing by anecdote is not governing, it's demagoguery."
02_02_2017,housing crisis,"This is a temporary emergency ordinance intended to stabilize or assist renters at risk of involuntary displacement during our housing crisis. We hope that it will be short-lived, but that will require the state legislature to overturn the ban on rent control and give the city back its regulatory tools. In the meantime, there's an easy [STREET] to avoid relocation assistance."
02_02_2017,housing crisis,"And that's only if developers are willing to start building for existing demand, which is not the market rate and luxury housing that they are primarily delivering. If you've come here [ORGANIZATION] to suggest that renters just move or get better jobs, it shows an utter lack of understanding around who is taking the brunt of the impact created by our housing crisis. Seniors and people with disabilities living on fixed incomes don't have the resources to move or the ability to get better jobs."
02_02_2017,affordable housing,"People of color who have faced historic and ongoing discrimination in both the housing and the job markets also tend to have more limited resources and options. Telling someone with limited resources to leave behind their family, their friends, and their community in search of elusive affordable housing elsewhere is terrible advice. Finally, this is not a landlord versus tenants conversation."
02_02_2017,housing crisis,"We are not seeking to demonize or penalize landlords, but we are asking them to recognize their role in our housing crisis and share in the burden they're creating, not just for their renters, but our entire city, when they choose to involuntarily displace a renter through no fault of the renter. We've heard from many landlords who support this ordinance, some of whom will be testifying [ORGANIZATION], who know that they can profitably operate their business whether they choose to avoid triggering relocation or not. We don't blame landlords for not recognizing how the forces of urban renewal, gentrification, displacement, and limited tenant protections converge to create this crisis over [LOCATION]."
02_02_2017,homeless; homelessness,"Thank you, Mayor and [ORGANIZATION] members. My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I'm here [ORGANIZATION] as the Director of [ORGANIZATION]. I appreciate the invitation to come and speak a little bit to you about the consequences of the [STREET] the rental market is impacting low-income households and homelessness in our community [ORGANIZATION]."
02_02_2017,homeless; homelessness,"In partnership with [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], our office tries to address homelessness first through prevention by keeping people from becoming homeless in the first [STREET]. Over [ORGANIZATION], that has been an increasingly difficult thing to do. We have tens of thousands of very low-income households who are already rent-burdened, paying 50%, 60%, 70% or more of their very limited income toward rent."
02_02_2017,homelessness,"In my previous work at [ORGANIZATION], we routinely had people on long-term disability bringing in less than $800 a month who were paying as much as 100% of that income toward rent. In that situation, any little thing that went wrong could put them back on the [STREET]. When those extremely rent-burdened families have a temporary interruption in income or an unplanned expense, they face homelessness."
02_02_2017,affordable housing,"Unless their incomes increase proportionate to rent, which is not happening for the low-income people in our community, they will eventually lose their housing. And while in this market finding alternative affordable housing units is a challenge, [ORGANIZATION] has about one affordable unit for every five extremely low-income households who need one, finding replacement housing is only the first challenge. Once a family has found a unit, they too often can't come up with the several thousand dollars in [ORGANIZATION] rent and deposit that landlords are requiring to get into units."
02_02_2017,homeless,"The result? In too many cases, families that receive excessive rent increases or no-cause evictions can't find and raise the funds to get into alternative housing in time, and they become homeless. That explains why, even as with expanded city and county investments, we've helped a record number of people with prevention assistance and helped a record number of people get back into permanent housing, over 4,600 people [ORGANIZATION]."
02_02_2017,homelessness,"The most recent one [ORGANIZATION], and those beds immediately filled up too. We see this continued surge in people facing homelessness and other data as well. In [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION], our community's information and referral line, fielded over 11,000 inquiries from people seeking help with housing."
02_02_2017,homeless,"Compare that to [ORGANIZATION], where they received less than half as many housing-related calls, and those calls made up just 22% of their inquiries. When we look at the homeless system as a whole, we find that a significant majority of the people receiving shelter and housing assistance are new to the system, meaning they haven't accessed services in [LOCATION]. And our shelters are reporting high percentages of families who have never been homeless before."
02_02_2017,homeless,"Not only are more people in jeopardy of becoming homeless because of what is happening in our housing market, every successful intervention that we are able to provide costs more money.  more to cover rent, more to cover our deposit and move-in fees. So the resources we do have are not going as far. We are estimating that just based on increases in rents, our non-profit agencies will be able to serve 8 to 10 percent fewer households with our current funding level [ORGANIZATION]."
02_02_2017,homeless,"In short, our efforts to help people avoid becoming homeless and to help those who become homeless get back into permanent housing are more significant than ever, and yet we're  We won't be successful if we don't address what is happening to low-income households in this rental market. So we are happy to be available for questions as you talk about amendments. Otherwise, I think it's time for an invited testimony."
02_02_2017,homeless,"That's why we dedicated $30 million in [LOCATION] and county resources [ORGANIZATION] to homeless services and prevention. With our new investments, we've kept thousands of people in their homes and put thousands of people back into housing. And that's why I hope you'll help me keep that funding in [STREET] [LOCATION] and ensure that we can keep increasing the number of people we help."
02_02_2017,homelessness; housing crisis,"For those of you who don't know us all that well, and I think most of you do, but I'll say it anyway, we're a nonprofit organization serving [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]. We have some perspective on this ordinance and the housing crisis the community is experiencing because we see its impacts [ORGANIZATION]. We provide eviction prevention services that have helped hundreds of families avoid the trauma of homelessness."
02_02_2017,homeless; homelessness,"We operate [DATE] homeless shelters, one for families and one for single women, and we see what's happening with folks experiencing homelessness. You heard from [ORGANIZATION] how those shelters are overflowing on a nightly basis. And we work closely with many private landlords."
02_02_2017,homelessness,"There are good landlords willing to work with tenants and agencies like ours where we invest dollars that your city council and [ORGANIZATION] have invested in successful programs that are moving people out of homelessness. [TIME], roughly 5,000 [ORGANIZATION] will be safely inside instead of outside because of what we are able to do. And the great majority of those are kids."
02_02_2017,homeless,No-cause evictions are simply the most common reason given by families coming into our shelter [TIME]. So we're seeing a huge influx of families coming into the [INSTITUTION]. Most of them are saying they received a no-cause eviction.
02_02_2017,homelessness,"So what's happening? Well, we're raising a generation of kids in this community who are experiencing residential displacement and homelessness at record rates. Every indicator we have tells us that when kids are forced to move, change schools, experience homelessness...  Every opportunity they have to succeed in school, to form healthy friendship bonds, to advance physical and emotional health in a positive [STREET], all of those opportunities are destroyed."
02_02_2017,homelessness,"The key thing to note is that using a no-cause eviction in a situation in which a for-cause is called for is an end run around the due process of the tenant. These nightmare scenarios presume that the imaginary tenant is guilty, but in real life we don't know whether a tenant is guilty of the behavior of which they're accused until they get their day in [STREET]. The consequences of false accusations of bad behavior can be homelessness."
02_02_2017,affordable housing,"So we at [ORGANIZATION] are also a landlord. We operate 700 units of affordable housing, and we, by the terms of our financing, are prohibited from using no-cause evictions. So we, if...  we have to move to eviction."
02_02_2017,homelessness,"Hello. I'm [PERSON]. I serve as a board member on [ORGANIZATION], and recently I started ORG1."
02_02_2017,homelessness,"to take a more active role for our neighbors who are facing this displacement. Recently, these displaced neighbors have included a blind senior citizen who was unable to afford a large rent increase and was forced to choose between homelessness and moving out of state. We've also had several large families with children who received [ORGANIZATION] no-cause notices in [LOCATION]."
02_02_2017,houseless,"During a devastating and overwhelming houseless crisis, displacing low-income seniors, families, and marginalized communities is not the [STREET] for [ORGANIZATION] to go forward. The thin line between the house and the houseless was made more clear to our neighborhood recently during the snowstorm. When our community came together to form a temporary warming shelter, we heard many young stories from young, able-bodied people who were struggling to keep up with rent increases, only to lose their homes, find themselves living in their cars, and then unable to keep up basic hygiene and...  nor get sufficient sleep once they were able to find a job."
02_02_2017,homeless,"This ordinance will not fix the homeless crisis, but it will be a step forward in making those conditions better for people living in my neighborhood on the edge of houselessness. Thank you for your time. Thank you."
02_02_2017,affordable housing,"What if the tenant accepts the money, spends it on something else, then refuses to leave, then hires a tenant's attorney, and if they win, then the landlord has to pay more money to the tenant for a situation where the landlord had a legitimate problem  reason to issue a notice of termination. Fundamentally,  Whether this proposal passes or not, it does not address the problem of a lack of available affordable housing units. What it does is it punishes the people who have made it their effort and their goal to provide housing for all of our citizens."
02_02_2017,housing crisis,"So while there may very well be some extraordinary circumstances that create hardship,  By and large, the hardship is on the tenants, and we are asking the landlords to consider their role in our housing crisis and stop no-cause evicting their tenants and stop and consider not raising the rent beyond 10% if they don't want to pay relocation. Tenants are not furniture that can be moved around, and they are not human ATMs. If you expect tenants to save [ORGANIZATION] moving expenses, the equivalent of [ORGANIZATION] rent,  When they are going to be lower income and have fewer resources than homeowners and property owners, then it is perfectly reasonable for us to expect property owners to be doing the same thing."
02_02_2017,housing crisis,"Speaker 4 I know, in fact, that we had conversations with people at your organization, but you weren't asked to participate, and I'll tell you why. Your organization is among many special interest groups that support the ban on rent control, that brought about the circumstances that have created the housing crisis we're in [ORGANIZATION]. Your organization has had [LOCATION]..."
02_02_2017,housing crisis,"I am the daughter of [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], of eminent domain in [ORGANIZATION]. My community has been experiencing a housing crisis since black residency was legalized in [ORGANIZATION]. I have been involved with local housing justice organizations since [ORGANIZATION]."
02_02_2017,homelessness,"The [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood remains among the top old [ORGANIZATION] neighborhoods most at risk of gentrification and involuntary displacement of low-income residents. The housing storm is hitting [ORGANIZATION]'s renting population hard and fast. With virtually nowhere to relocate within the community, most tenants facing no-fault eviction and skyrocketing rents are facing forced relocation outside the community, and many are at risk of homelessness."
02_02_2017,affordable housing,"The situation at the [ORGANIZATION] apartments is the latest example of the distressing trend in our community of no-fault eviction or effective evictions where 18 families, including 26 regular elementary school kids,  will be forced to relocate outside the [PERSON] neighborhood for lack of affordable housing options within the neighborhood. The families, as you've already heard, have given 90 notice of 100% rent increase. Some were $800 per month, so it was more than 100%."
02_02_2017,affordable housing,"I have a very small company in the city named [PERSON]. I have also been working... Living a really affordable housing for [ORGANIZATION], working in the trenches with the mom and pop owners of this city and the tenants that they have."
02_02_2017,housing crisis,"Before I get started [ORGANIZATION], I'd just like to say two points that boiled to my brain while sitting in the audience. One, thank you, [ORGANIZATION], for the boldness of bringing such an ordinance to this table. We are in a housing crisis."
02_02_2017,homeless,"All six tenants were past homeless, past alcoholics, past veterans, and they were all getting privately subsidized rent, 60% of market rent. I'm proud to say they've lived there for [ORGANIZATION] since we've owned the building. Absolutely no rent increase, and they still are privately subsidized."
02_02_2017,affordable housing,"They will become owner-occupied, thereby removing these units from the rental pool. Less units in the pool means higher rents, simple supply and demand, the opposite of what you're trying to achieve. The one thing that nearly everyone in this room can agree with is the need for affordable housing."
02_02_2017,homeless,"I work with the homeless, but I am here [ORGANIZATION] representing myself. I was served [TIME] a no-cause eviction. [ORGANIZATION], I dedicated 100% of my life to helping the less fortunate with a hands-up, assisting them with different agencies that have been mentioned [ORGANIZATION]."
02_02_2017,affordable housing,The measure is not going to help affordable housing because we're going to take affordable housing off of the market. It's not going to help affordable housing because we're going to raise the rents to the maximum level possible. DATE0 of vacancy negates a [LOCATION]'s worth of income.
02_02_2017,homelessness,"Thanks to my family and friends, I was able to make it. But compared to a lot of other people, that makes me lucky. We need to require landlords to pay relocation fees to protect tenants from being displaced into homelessness."
02_02_2017,affordable housing,"I believe in and I support the need for affordable housing. We are a big city now, and our city has changed. We have big city problems to solve and big city benefits to gain."
02_02_2017,housing crisis,"I agree that we are in a housing crisis, and I don't think that anybody thinks any differently. I agree with much of what advocates and proponents of this proposal have testified to. I feel the same [STREET], but I disagree that relocation fees –"
02_02_2017,affordable housing,"That will then taint attendance record and will make it very difficult for further renting. I sympathize with the council, the landlords, and the tenants with the issues of affordable housing. I suggest we come together to the table with an open mind.  and work towards an agreement that we can all move forward as a community together and not divided, rather than rushing into the same manner we're seeing in our current federal administration."
02_02_2017,homeless,And I believe in affordable living. I believe in housing the homeless. I believe in all that stuff.
02_02_2017,housing crisis,"I believe the same kind of bullying behavior which seems to be controlling national politics in these times. This ordinance is a reasoned and compassionate response to one aspect of the housing crisis which challenges the racial and economic diversity of our city. I would hope your response to the landlord's threats will be, bring it on."
02_02_2017,affordable housing,Maybe there should be a different [STREET] to look at that. And possibly we pass a bond measure for affordable housing. Why don't we look at buying that property?
02_02_2017,homeless,"hi my name is [ORGANIZATION] i'm a mom and pop rental property owner like many 10 units duplexes and triplexes already this is a high risk and high cost of doing this business and i think of myself as a housing provider i'm not in the business of making people homeless  It's never an easy decision to terminate a tenancy, and usually the problem has been going on for too long, often to the detriment of other residents whom I've lost because of problems that were hard to catch and enforce. So a no-cause termination has an important [STREET], and it needs to stay."
02_02_2017,housing crisis,"After being an ideal tenant, I was forced from my home into the housing crisis. I was barely able to stay in [ORGANIZATION], where my community is, where I run my small business, where my family and friends are, and where I call home. And I still feel the effects of that eviction [ORGANIZATION]."
02_02_2017,housing crisis,"Relocation is not... The fix to the multiple problems we are facing in our housing crisis, though it is a step in the right direction, it will ease the tremendous cost burden tenants face when evicted for no cause. It will deter landlords from treating their tenants like used furniture that you drop off at [ORGANIZATION]."
02_02_2017,homeless,"Is that something that we can have as homeless people? You know, can we incorporate them and give them a skill, have them build a tiny house and have them actually live in a home  Maybe new homeowners can have attainable mortgages for tiny houses. Very good."
02_02_2017,affordable housing,"I'm now a tenant in [ORGANIZATION] due to the no-cause unlawful eviction that I experienced [ORGANIZATION]. I'm going to stick to just the differentiating points that haven't been brought up yet. I wanted to mention online booking services and how these are becoming, you know, [ORGANIZATION] and such are becoming a solution for tenants now where they're going on and booking long-term housing, which is what I did, and part of  Part of my decision to take my job up here in [PERSON] and move here with my family was based on affordable housing that I found on [ORGANIZATION]."
02_02_2017,affordable housing,"So you'll reduce your inventory. Again, Commissioner [PERSON] on doing the affordable housing bond, build, build, build. You raised over $250 million."
02_02_2017,housing crisis,"I support a lot of nonprofits and folks that are struggling out there, and this housing crisis is very, very serious. I've heard some stories [TIME] that I hadn't heard before, and it touches my heart. I have four tenants, all of them paying under market."
02_02_2017,homeless,"Why don't you go ahead and start, since you're – PERSON0. So I think it's pretty apparent that we need some policy changes like this. This is just one of many policy changes that we're going to need if we're going to make any dent in the housing and homeless issue."
02_02_2017,affordable housing,"Um,  and you can punish landlords, you can punish tenants and stuff. What stops the landlords from raising the rents and pushing affordable housing out of [ORGANIZATION]? Thank you, sir."
02_02_2017,affordable housing,"We are going through extreme growing pains in this city, and that's why the two top issues on our agenda [ORGANIZATION] are going to be new resources to meet the crisis of affordable housing and stronger renter protections. Thank you. And that's reflected in our legislative agenda."
02_02_2017,affordable housing,"And what disturbs me perhaps the most of all is that kids have to move to different schools, and it's well known that any time a child has to move in school, that costs them [ORGANIZATION] of learning. That is a price that is too steep to pay. In [LOCATION], the city council has acted dramatically to increase the resources to create more affordable housing in our city."
02_02_2017,affordable housing,"But that is a longer-term solution, and that's not the question before us [ORGANIZATION]. While I'm confident that over time we are going to create more affordable housing under inclusionary housing that just took effect [LOCATION], under the housing bond that just passed DATE2, under the dramatic increase in urban renewal resources that we've devoted to creating more affordable housing, I'm confident that in the long term we will make up that deficit. But it is a big deficit."
02_02_2017,homelessness,"and it does not help the families and children who find who are faced with the imminent threats of homelessness i do not believe this policy is perfect but i do believe it is necessary and i appreciate commissioner [ORGANIZATION] and mayor [PERSON] for their leadership on this issue i take the feedback and candor of those who believe this is the wrong solution seriously and i appreciate the robust discussion we had at [ORGANIZATION]'s hearing regarding those concerns  I believe [PERSON], during [PERSON], this policy in operation will be critical in gauging whether this policy is working and how it may need to be adjusted and whether it is having unintended consequences that we should be concerned about."
02_02_2017,housing crisis,"So now to my thank yous. I'd like to thank the many community partners who have not only worked with us to craft this policy, but have been pushing the conversation of helping vulnerable tenants since this housing crisis began. I asked my policy director, [ORGANIZATION], to make me this thank you list so that I wouldn't forget anyone."
01_13_2016,homeless,And they're homeless. And they're sick. And they're sicker.
01_13_2016,affordable housing,"I think there's a lot that [ORGANIZATION] can do to help affordable housing more than has happened so far. So I hope that there's a role for the commission on that. And also a little thank you to our partners who are with us here, because this is a lot of time commitment."
01_13_2016,affordable housing,Thank you.  very smart people. I think [ORGANIZATION] has provided me with lots of insights on how our comp plan can support affordable housing. And I hope we will address some of those issues when we adopt the comp plan.
01_13_2016,homelessness,"So I think Judge [PERSON] has been very helpful in this latest decision, protecting First Amendment rights. There are a lot of things that the public can disagree on because if you're taking three-quarters of Americans are now paycheck to paycheck, three-quarters of Americans close to homelessness. I understand the pressures that you're under."
01_13_2016,housing crisis,"So we are not actually addressing the documented area of need in our housing crisis, which is why I hope the legislature gives us the flexibility to address inclusionary housing. And I hope we don't take our eye off of...  providing housing for people that we have clear evidence they're being priced out of the marketplace, and that is certainly well below 80% MFI. Thank you."
01_13_2016,affordable housing,"Thank you, [ORGANIZATION], for really being a bulldog around getting the multi-program to work. And that includes the amendments you brought to council to respond to some concerns we had from the development community. this is one of our most important tools and frankly it's not just an affordability tool it's a fair housing tool to ensure that we put affordable housing in high opportunity areas so thank you for your work on this PERSON1"
01_13_2016,affordable housing,"So by incorporation,  Encouraging this upzoning and the demolition, you're actually destroying density. You're losing affordable housing, and you're also losing this wonderful mix of historic structures that span a period from [ORGANIZATION] to have a monoculture of our 2.5 single-family houses, $700,000, 3,000 square feet plus. So the new zoning will encourage demolitions and is at odds with a determination of eligibility and a potential viable historic district, and with Goal 5 of [ORGANIZATION], which asks to conserve historic areas."
01_13_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"In my opinion, the most critical issue in [ORGANIZATION] is that development is out of control. This is what is creating a lack of affordable housing and adding to homelessness. While development can be good for the city and create employment, uncontrolled development is not."
01_13_2016,affordable housing,"There's all kinds of property that could be developed now. There's some money coming through for affordable housing. If you have to do an incentive to get some builders out there in that far reach of [ORGANIZATION], do it."
01_13_2016,affordable housing,"If we don't get affordable housing, we're going to end up with a –  an exodus from [ORGANIZATION] that will mean we don't need those 300,000 rent units for people to live in because it's becoming unlivable, as you know, if you attended the concern about housing and lack of it. Think that apartments can be built and occupied within [ORGANIZATION] on FAC0 FAC1, [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]. And now that those funds are available, please use them to develop affordable housing in an area that is waiting for it and ready for it, [PERSON]."
01_13_2016,unhoused,And please leave our historic districts unhoused. so that they maintain their beauty and their history. Five stories in the midst of two one-story retail buildings with no retail and no parking is an abomination.
01_13_2016,affordable housing,"Goal 5D, affordable housing. And 5E, high performance housing. Our little homes are very efficient and have a very minimal carbon footprint."
01_13_2016,housing crisis,"Hi, my name is [ORGANIZATION], and I have rented in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood for [ORGANIZATION]. In fact, 80% of my neighbors rent here  Nevertheless, [ORGANIZATION] and much of [PERSON] is experiencing a housing crisis with record low vacancy rates and an epidemic of displacement of long-term residents. As a renter threatened by displacement myself, I strongly support upzoning of plots adjacent to centers and quarters in the [ORGANIZATION] area,  and the inner southeast as a whole."
01_13_2016,affordable housing,"You heard about the issues we've had with south of FAC0 before, and our main issues besides that would be that we would consider affordable housing impact statements as a policy, perhaps 5.45%. PERSON0, this is a very useful thing. [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], [PERSON] are all using these impact statements as a [STREET] of mechanism of implementing affordable housing and the policies that are in this document."
01_13_2016,homeless,"It's a good, viable system, and it helps even homeless and wayward, not wayward travelers, but people along the freeway. During the snowstorm, other things happen too, and therein lies the plot. I'm a nurse, a former ORG0 nurse."
02_27_2019,houseless,"Okay.  163, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding city ignores grassroots orgs proven ability to help houseless with villages. 164, request of Ree PERSON1 to address council regarding city ignores grassroots orgs proven ability to help houseless with villages. 165, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding city ignores grassroots orgs proven ability to help houseless with villages."
02_27_2019,houseless,"And [ORGANIZATION], request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding city ignores grassroots orgs proven ability to help houseless with villages. Welcome. Anyone can begin."
02_27_2019,houseless,"Please state your name for the record. Hi, my name is [ORGANIZATION]. And DATE0 I was here to talk with everybody about the need for a village for our folks in [ORGANIZATION], our houseless people."
02_27_2019,affordable housing,I'm exhausted. We're doing outreach during [ORGANIZATION] and we're doing shelter shifts at [TIME]. We're  This leads into the affordable housing.
02_27_2019,affordable housing,"Sorry, I told you we're everywhere right now. Of course I voted yes on the affordable housing bond. But here's the problem."
02_27_2019,affordable housing,"Affordable housing are not low to moderate income units. In [ORGANIZATION], we've built well over 5,000 affordable units. We have built 500 low to moderate income units."
02_27_2019,houseless,"[ORGANIZATION], CEO of [ORGANIZATION], an outreach program for the houseless. I'm going to play off of [PERSON]'s. You know, [TIME] I'm coming off of [TIME] of...  outreach on the streets [TIME] going into a [TIME] shift at the shelter because we don't have enough volunteers and people aren't getting paid for the work they should get paid for."
02_27_2019,houseless,"We do it all with our heart, but we do it with no funding, and we don't get paid for the work we do. I think that what we're all here for is a little recognition of the amount of time and effort we put in, and  Maybe somehow we can, like [ORGANIZATION] said or [PERSON] said, one big team, start to cooperate and see some of those funds that go into other houseless organizations that really there's no accountability for their funding from what I can see or very little accountability. I would love to see those records blatantly opened up to the public and let all of our orgs let their records stand for themselves."
02_27_2019,homelessness,"Somebody came into office thinking that they could cure homelessness in [ORGANIZATION], and they closed us out of the process. And after they discovered what we're up against, we are still closed out of the process. But we're in the trench digging the ditches."
02_27_2019,houseless,"Second question is, have you talked to the county about this? Because as you know, the city contracts with the county to provide services for people who are houseless. Can we shut up the process?"
02_27_2019,homeless,"I want to be really clear that we decided that having some services by the city, some by the county, was not wise use of taxpayers' dollars. And if we streamlined it and the city puts in over $30 million to [ORGANIZATION], then that would be the [STREET] to go. My concern is that another table has been created that we were not invited to."
02_27_2019,affordable housing,"One statistic I'll throw out as we move to the slides is 49% of all housing units built in [ORGANIZATION] within [ORGANIZATION] were constructed within a quarter mile of the streetcar tracks. And that includes a third of all subsidized affordable housing in the city of [ORGANIZATION]. Additionally, [ORGANIZATION] is a proud partner in the region's low-income fare program, which is operated by [ORGANIZATION]."
02_27_2019,affordable housing,"That's not an accident. We have a lot more planned under construction. Nearly a third of all the jobs in the city are on the streetcar line, and over a third of all subsidized affordable housing units are on the streetcar line."
02_27_2019,affordable housing,"So between those two parcels, you've got a fairly significant opportunity to think about shaping the city and thinking about achieving some of the goals that we're all pursuing in terms of climate change, affordable housing, and access to services and jobs. And I would encourage the city to be aggressive in this conversation. We are a piece of it, but we're not the only piece."
02_27_2019,affordable housing,"You can see a majority of those funds are going to [ORGANIZATION]. We're talking about potential land use scenarios in northwest [ORGANIZATION] and what that would look like from a housing and jobs balance and how much affordable housing could be provided if you pursued X, Y, and Z zoning changes. And then also [ORGANIZATION] is leading an equity analysis or equity balance sheet conversation.  trying to identify who's benefiting and who's being burdened by both the costs and the benefits of the streetcar extension."
02_27_2019,affordable housing,"What [ORGANIZATION] is using the money for, both the ORG1 grant as well as the city money, is to examine five different land use scenarios. So if we shifted it from A to B to C to D, how much housing would that produce? How much affordable housing would that produce?"
02_27_2019,affordable housing,"The land use piece is the extra dividend of [LOCATION]. And if the conversations do heat up about the [ORGANIZATION] site, which is obviously a terrific site, my guess is it's going to have huge environmental issues before you ever get to [DATE] that there's development. But if we do get to a point of development, it's also an enormous opportunity to build in specific concrete goals around affordable housing."
02_27_2019,affordable housing,"Thank you. And as we think about adding infrastructure and streetcar and providing benefits and public resources, we should make sure that we get the best possible deal. And I would like to see a neighborhood as integrated as the [ORGANIZATION] is in terms of affordable housing and market rate housing."
02_27_2019,homeless,"I would assume this would apply to her. But I'm really sad about...  the homeless people under bridges and schools, because they don't have a professional trade association lobbyist to come in and talk for them. And that's actually what's happening here."
02_27_2019,homeless,"The first is [ORGANIZATION], which is a homeless support nonprofit. They're located on FAC0, just south of [ORGANIZATION]. And the second is FAC1, which is located on FAC2, also south of [ORGANIZATION]."
02_27_2019,homeless,Thank you for the clarification. I would love it if it was even slightly more convoluted. I guess the...  homeless camping or urban impact reduction or hooker or whatever.
01_06_2016,homelessness,"We're leveraging your investment in a number of ways in a public-private partnership, but also allowing us to address issues like housing and homelessness with kids that may end up in that [STREET] if we don't break the cycle of poverty. And we know that for every kid we can keep out of poverty over five generations, roughly 200 of their descendants will also be affected. So the leverage we're creating is tremendous."
01_06_2016,homeless,"Appreciate it. Okay, let's take item number four, please. Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding homeless suite, homeless state of emergency."
01_06_2016,homeless,"And I think that's conflicting with the homeless state of emergency. So I don't know how you guys are going to handle this, but you need to...  you know, cancel your contracts or alter them. And so homeless people aren't getting swept through these old existing contracts."
01_06_2016,homeless,"And also, you know, everyone's all patting you guys on the back for letting one more city-sanctioned homeless camp stay at [ORGANIZATION], which is, you know, only has a capacity of 40 people. You know, that's hardly worth a big amount of praise if –  that's all you've done in [ORGANIZATION] of your office when you've basically overpriced the city for a lot of people. And, uh,  So it's hardly making a dent."
01_06_2016,homeless,"I hope you'll start opening at least five or ten more city-sanctioned homeless camps and actually really make a dent instead of a minor league little dent. And also the [ORGANIZATION] situation, I saw it actually expand city land, and you guys get [ORGANIZATION] land, and then it expands your police powers to evict the homeless campers.  that aren't on the [ORGANIZATION] turf. And basically, the [ORGANIZATION] camp is already on city land, so I kind of see it as a legal [ORGANIZATION] land grab to expand police powers."
01_06_2016,homeless; homelessness,"And there's a lot of different things you could do to actually change the situation with homelessness. There's a thing called hot teams in other cities where they send out...  homeless outreach teams with various agencies when they go out with the police and, um,  have contact with homeless people, and they offer them services and other stuff. And by people constantly being swept around, it really makes it hard for service agencies to actually go provide services to the homeless people when they can't even find the people they're trying to service."
01_06_2016,homeless,"And there's another thing also. If you guys are going to have the police do a lot of outreach...  and contact with homeless people all the time, you might want to train them too in actually knowing how to navigate the social services of our city because they give out these little green pamphlets that have about nine addresses on it, and that's about all they do. And, you know, if you actually get some people to train them,  You know, so they actually know the various services and how..."
01_06_2016,houseless,"Thank you very much. Okay, item number five. Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel regarding humane solutions to being houseless."
01_06_2016,housing crisis,"So we were happy to see that the council committed 50% of [ORGANIZATION] budget surplus to infrastructure maintenance, and we urge you to commit to do the same for [LOCATION]. Now, we realize that the city has other urgent priorities, like the housing crisis,  But we think that committing 50% of surpluses to maintenance is important for a couple reasons. First, it's fiscally prudent."
01_06_2016,houseless,It's actually not just an issue for during track down time. It's something we actually need to be mindful of.  all the time as we deal with our houseless situation and the many people that sleep along FAC0. That's right.
02_13_2019,homelessness,"First up is communications. [ORGANIZATION], could you please call the first individual? Item 114, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding homelessness."
02_13_2019,homeless,"Thank you. All right. Homeless people should be a protected class, as we do not enjoy the full rights of [ORGANIZATION] citizenship."
02_13_2019,homeless,"One of our objectives is to count accurately every homeless person in the [ORGANIZATION] metropolitan area on DATE0 DATE1. As we gear up towards DATE2, I think it's important to look back at [ORGANIZATION]. I want to thank Commissioner [PERSON] for his outstanding leadership as co-chair of the local [ORGANIZATION] ORG0."
02_13_2019,homeless,"In the words of Congressman [PERSON] from [ORGANIZATION], ""[URL]munities currently suffering economic anxiety cannot afford to lose federal resourcing due to a lack of census accuracy. ""  The homeless do not have the same access to broadband internet as others, and this divide may leave hundreds of thousands uncounted nationally unless it's thoughtfully addressed. Our friends in [PERSON] have an interesting solution."
02_13_2019,homeless,"They'll be deploying [ORGANIZATION], which will provide broadband Internet access to hard-to-count populations. Grant money exists for a similar program here, and I believe that the kiosks could then be repurposed after ORG0 Day to be a lifeline for the homeless as an early warning system for emergency communications and as a portal to vital social services. I've recently spoken with [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION], and she enthusiastically endorses the throwing of census parties as a [STREET] to bring many hard-to-count individuals together in one or multiple locations so that they may be counted."
02_13_2019,homeless,"These parties, as I see it, could become social service fairs at which homeless individuals will connect with each other and important resources in a fun, safe, and pro-social manner. Finally, [ORGANIZATION] has begun reaching out to local leaders, shelters, transitional housing providers, churches, soup kitchens, needle exchanges, [STREET] organizations, neighborhood associations, and ad hoc camping communities as we work to identify and prepare to count every homeless person in the region. We're working hard on a formal proposal, and [ORGANIZATION] I'll be traveling to [ORGANIZATION], where I hope to meet with [ORGANIZATION] Manager [PERSON] and other representatives from ORG2."
02_13_2019,affordable housing,"Next individual. Item 115, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel regarding affordable housing guidelines. She is not able to make it."
02_13_2019,unhoused,"Good morning. Thank you very much, [ORGANIZATION]. As you know, I've talked with you for probably [DATE] now about the unhoused  And Mayor [PERSON], as you know, we're in litigation, and you told the press that you would ignore the [ORGANIZATION] decision, which was paralleled with mine, which I consider that to be kind of fascist, actually, to ignore a [STREET] decision."
02_13_2019,unhoused,"And look at my second case and see if we can't find some kind of common ground here. Now, the solutions are pretty clear for the unhoused. Small villages all over the city, 25 or smaller."
02_13_2019,homeless,"Okay? So whatever the homeless count was [ORGANIZATION], you multiply that times five. Okay?"
02_13_2019,unhoused,"It's something where community members that are housed, unhoused, businesses in the area, we can create a plan to really proactively address what some perceived or other issues that may arise from these new people in our community. We put together a plan to have individuals  programming in public places, try to get additional lighting among other amenities, as well as create an environment where we can make sure that the housed, the unhoused, and those that are in shelter have opportunities to communicate, to get to know each other, because ultimately public safety comes from knowing your neighbors, no matter who they are. And so we want to make sure we encourage that type of behavior and really welcome it into our community."
02_13_2019,homeless,"Having said that, I would like to say,  that [ORGANIZATION] and the city attorneys are dragging their feet on realizing that homeless people are a protected class. PERSON0, this is not about that. Again, I ask you this [ORGANIZATION], and I ask you very nicely."
02_13_2019,homeless,It is on topic. It pains me that [ORGANIZATION] isn't recognizing homeless people as human beings before the law. It pains me.
02_13_2019,homelessness,"Do you support this ordinance or do you not support this ordinance? Yes, I support it. And I would support homelessness as a protected class as well."
02_13_2019,houseless,"We have emergencies in this city. The state of public education, the treatment of our houseless population, the opioid crisis, those are emergencies. Giving a contract to [ORGANIZATION] is not an emergency, and I urge you to vote against this emergency ordinance."
02_13_2019,houseless,"Patient living in a nursing home, previously houseless. She wanted me to say she is against this. Dr. [PERSON]."
02_13_2019,homeless,"Out of the ethical imperative to treat the homeless wanderer and the refugee equally with the homeborn, we reject the federal government's persecution of those immigrants who are our neighbors living in our midst. Out of the ethical imperative that justice requires truth, we reject the assertion that the [ORGANIZATION] work can only be done in secrecy from you, or that [ORGANIZATION] police should have discretion to engage in deception in the course of their work. And out of the ethical imperative to treat others as we ourselves wish to be treated, we believe and support those who among us testify to their persecution."
02_13_2019,homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION] issued a statement [ORGANIZATION] declaring that police violence is a public health issue that disproportionately impacts communities of color, people with disabilities and mental illnesses, people living in poverty, people experiencing homelessness, immigrant communities, and LGBTQ communities. In short, how we police our communities has a direct impact on the public's health. So considering both effectiveness and equity, we dig ourselves in even deeper in our relationship with the ORG1."
01_16_2019,affordable housing,We have an agenda that includes affordable housing. It includes significant pay equity issues. It includes significant issues that are of concern to everybody.
01_16_2019,homeless; homelessness,"Good morning. I'm [PERSON], and I'm speaking as an advocate for the homeless in [ORGANIZATION] on behalf of [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON] is an ongoing state of emergency in [ORGANIZATION]."
01_16_2019,homeless,Merchants complain about the homeless downtown. The people in the community object to people in their backyard. No one wants homeless people on the [STREET].
01_16_2019,houseless,"Good morning. My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I'm presenting you some solutions that city council can implement pretty soon. And I'm going to give you two examples that I've observed where people who were elderly with disabilities were made houseless as a result of city policy."
01_16_2019,houseless,"In one case, it involved making at least 12 people houseless, jobless, indebted, and further disabled. So immediately punish any use of [ORGANIZATION] dollars used to make people houseless. This includes city taxes, fees, fines, impound, confiscation, theft, hold, grants, loans, tax breaks, or partnerships."
01_16_2019,houseless,"Punish the harassment or worse of people who are houseless, poor, or suffering. [PERSON], cop, pay. Okay."
01_16_2019,houseless,"Protect civilians' rights, access, and use of their documents, tools, clothing, gear, and transport needed for housing, work, and custody health. that otherwise would make them houseless. Punish [ORGANIZATION] cop uniforms, gear used off-duty, especially to terrorize poor or suffering people."
01_16_2019,houseless,"If you're not being paid on duty, don't wear the uniform. Pay [ORGANIZATION] cops, et cetera, normal rates during protests, paperwork for end-of-shifts arrests, houseless interactions, or military exercises. Frequently, they will wait till the end of the shift and arrest houseless so they can get overtime at the end of the shift."
01_16_2019,houseless,"She had just been made houseless by the city of [ORGANIZATION] police, who had gone after her landlord because he couldn't get mail when he was in the hospital dying with cancer and was blind. And then when they had a hearing, while he was at [ORGANIZATION] to have the hearing, the [ORGANIZATION] police came. with military weapons and closed down the house and evicted all of the people who had businesses on the property and all the tenants who had been paid."
01_16_2019,houseless,"And it was [ORGANIZATION], the grandmother of [PERSON]. And it was a house with several businesses and other housing within it in which people had businesses and housing. All those people became unemployed and houseless as a result of the [ORGANIZATION] police doing an illegal action and then destroying their property."
01_16_2019,housing crisis,"The title for one, [ORGANIZATION] and the Ghost of PERSON1, was changed to the more polite real action needed to ease housing crisis.  has been kind enough over [ORGANIZATION] to print articles we sent in vis-a-vis the DATE1 primary DATE2 in that election, why [ORGANIZATION] by far was the best choice of the five candidates in that primary, along with an article for effective gun control laws to ban assault weapons and ban high-caliber magazines. We appreciate the [ORGANIZATION] doing that. Going forward, the tripartite presidency of [LOCATION], PERSON4, and PERSON5 seeks to do one thing,  protect privilege and power of white men against the poor, against workers, against immigrants, against students and tenants and transit riders,  against [ORGANIZATION], against 53 not real countries, to paraphrase [ORGANIZATION] just a bit."
01_16_2019,affordable housing,"Authorize new construction financing in an amount not to exceed $4.5 million for construction of FAC0, a 61-unit affordable housing project. Colleagues, apropos to the public testimony we just heard, I'm very proud to bring forward 60 additional units of affordable housing that's going to be added to the city's affordable housing stock. As you've heard me say on behalf of [ORGANIZATION] a number of times, [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION] we delivered a record number of affordable housing units to [ORGANIZATION]."
01_16_2019,affordable housing,"It will provide permanent affordable housing and homes to 195 new residents. I'm sorry, 194 new residents. [ORGANIZATION] will provide deeply affordable homes for 40 households, households who make less than 30% of the median family income."
01_16_2019,homelessness; affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] is working closely with both [PERSON] and ORG2 to make this a reality, and I'd like to thank them for stepping in to offer both service and operating support to make sure that this building is successful and is home for [ADDRESS] out of homelessness. Before I turn it over to the team at ORG3 to say a few words, I'd just like to note that we expect construction to start [ORGANIZATION], actually in [LOCATION], and construction is expected to be complete by DATE2, welcoming 194 new residents into permanent affordable housing. PERSON0, before you turn it over, could you go back one slide?"
01_16_2019,affordable housing,"Sure. I just have to point this out. I mean, this is affordable housing."
01_16_2019,homeless; affordable housing,"Well, it's a great question, and I'm happy to say we have a lot of experience with mixed-income housing, which is basically what this is. Most communities that we're developing in now have a requirement that in addition to the affordable housing, up to 60% [ORGANIZATION], that we include a percentage, and it varies in every jurisdiction, of permanent supportive housing or special needs housing or homeless housing. And so our management, we self-manage most of our properties and take that responsibility.  commitment and obligation very, very seriously."
01_16_2019,homeless,"Since DATE0. I believe that [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] is the only [STREET] where  where homeless people or people who are disadvantaged can go. You did not make the FAC0 shelter."
01_16_2019,homeless,"When I was homeless in [ORGANIZATION], there was a mass medical thing at FAC0. Commissioner [PERSON],  [PERSON] mentioned FAC0 as a mash [STREET] to put sheltered people. I agree."
01_16_2019,homeless,They steal from the homeless disabled people in there. And there are elderly homeless on the [STREET] who are incontinent and have Parkinson's. And they've been...  exited from their housing units and they won't go into shelters because they get bullied and their stuff gets stolen.
01_16_2019,affordable housing,And none of these affordable housing units are going to take these people. They're cherry picking the people who have the least disability and the most ORG0 income. and that's who's going to get in there.
01_16_2019,affordable housing,"I mean, it took me [TIME] to do one load of laundry because the spinner in the one washer and the one dryer, the spinner doesn't work. and the dryer takes [TIME] to dry one load of laundry, and how many hundreds of people are in that building who have to compete for that one washer and one dryer, and then they have a scheduling. So this affordable housing thing is for people who are able-bodied."
01_16_2019,affordable housing,"As you know, I've been here for DATE0 DATE1, and I've often spoken in support of the affordable housing projects. I live in one of the projects, the [ORGANIZATION]. In fact, when I was looking at the pictures of this new project, I was thinking, gee, this looks a lot like the [ORGANIZATION]."
01_16_2019,affordable housing,"I do want to, with all due respect, I do want to kind of correct some things that [ORGANIZATION] was talking about. Shelters are temporary emergency facilities.  methods. And we can build all the shelters in the world, but if we don't start building the affordable housing that we need to have a [STREET] for people to transition into, it's not going to make any difference what we do in terms of the emergency shelter."
01_16_2019,affordable housing,"I would encourage people, I've said this before, the term affordable housing is, a lot of people don't really understand what it is. This is a Section 42 tax credit housing, and I'd encourage people to go look this up and understand how this works. It's income restricted."
01_16_2019,affordable housing,"Okay. We need more of this, and I want to applaud the city and the county for what they've been doing for [ORGANIZATION] in really pressing forward with more affordable housing. It is kind of interesting, Mayor [PERSON], when you said, when you commented about the architecturally pleasing design."
01_16_2019,affordable housing,"I think one thing I would like to suggest is,  [ORGANIZATION], I'm so excited. When they came to [ORGANIZATION] and built the FAC0, when you see what they've done in other cities across the country, it's pretty phenomenal, the work that they've done and how they've made their focus change. affordable housing."
01_16_2019,affordable housing,"I would like to suggest that maybe, and perhaps they already do this, that they form sort of an advisory group of people living in affordable housing and get some feedback from them about where there could be some improvements. That's a great idea. Yeah."
01_16_2019,affordable housing,"One is increasing our affordable housing stock, and two is adopting sustainable building practices that are going to help us meet our climate goals moving forward. I also want to thank [ORGANIZATION] for not sacrificing aesthetics and quality. This is a really good-looking building, like the mayor pointed out."
01_16_2019,homelessness; affordable housing; houseless,"As a result, district coalitions have adapted our programming, partnerships, and planning to include constituencies and issues beyond solely the neighborhood system. Over [ORGANIZATION], district coalitions have worked on many projects around homelessness and affordable housing. In [LOCATION], coalitions partnered together to create a community development strategy for neighborhoods to work with the houseless community to identify safe sleep areas in our districts."
01_16_2019,homelessness; houseless,"This has been a long process, but with the help of many stakeholders, neighborhood, and houseless advocates, [ORGANIZATION] has been successfully located in [ORGANIZATION]. Coalitions have partnered with ORG1 ORG2 program to create enhanced services in our inner city neighborhoods. ORG2 is a vocational training program that works with folks with lived experience of homelessness who help provide trash and sanitation to pop-up camps and after [ORGANIZATION] usually get job placement."
01_16_2019,housing crisis; affordable housing,"From a communications perspective, coalitions have been very active regarding houselessness and affordable housing. Much of our online as well as our print and mailed newspapers, which I have one here in case you haven't seen it,  have been focused on daylighting the humanitarian crisis and trying to explain a very complicated civic challenge. Additionally, we have held many community meetings and town halls to discuss the housing crisis."
01_16_2019,affordable housing,"We've created videos like Five Things to Know About Houselessness and recently created a whimsical map of how affordable housing works featuring an illustrated bunny and an owl. Looking to the future, all seven district coalitions remain committed to addressing issues that affect all of our residents. Houselessness and affordable housing are only two of many complex challenges that we face as a growing and changing city."
01_16_2019,homeless,"I noticed last time she was here that you didn't comment on the fact that she was concerned that there were some empty houses that could have been fixed up, that low-income or homeless people could have been put in. But you made a comment about flowers being able to cheer people up. So, you know, she brought up a serious issue and you totally blew it off."
01_16_2019,homeless,He's homeless. He's homeless. He won't go into the shelters because he gets bullied and his stuff gets taken.
01_16_2019,houseless,"Commissioner [PERSON]. Thank you, Mayor. You mentioned that this visitor facilities fund, we're still in the process of negotiating for houseless services as part of updating the [ORGANIZATION]."
01_16_2019,houseless,"And I thought that there were at least three or four facilities that were going to have some repairs done in addition to additional resources for houseless services. I guess I'm really concerned that if we start taking them out one at a time, we will never get to the housing service component of this [ORGANIZATION] update. And so where are we on that?"
01_16_2019,homelessness,"In the previous discussions, it was a $40 million contribution to the [ORGANIZATION], $40 million for additional P5 needs. There was money in there for Expo as well as the homelessness services. We need to get back to the table to talk about those."
01_16_2019,homeless,"So Chair PERSON0 and I met DATE0. Okay. And while there's no guarantees, I think we are all committed to getting to yes on an agreement that puts forward those resources for services related to our permanent supportive housing and chronic homeless service continuum."
01_16_2019,homelessness,"But I want to say  state on the record that homelessness is absolutely related to tourism and that this is a legitimate use of these dollars. Tourism is a driver of gentrification, displacement, and unaffordability. There is a 94% correlation, or I should say there is an overwhelming correlation between unaffordability and homelessness."
01_16_2019,homeless,"And tourism has a major role to play in that. We hear from the tourism industry and businesses who depend on tourist dollars, the impact that our homeless crisis is having on them. And while as a business owner I can certainly understand their concerns and sympathize to a certain degree, we need them to recognize that they are part of the problem and that we need to devote dollars to mitigating the impact of tourism on our housing and homeless communities."
01_16_2019,homeless,"And again, testimony must be germane to the subject at hand. Okay, it doesn't matter how many dollars you allot to housing, homeless, social services, if...  the people that you put in [STREET] are not connected to the agencies that can help them. The quote-unquote social worker who has no education or training in social work and cannot connect this man at the library to any social agencies and will not because he's complaining about his pay, that it's above his pay grade."
01_16_2019,homeless,You're talking about dollars for housing and homeless services. You're talking about an ordinance that would allocate $2 million of the...  visitors development fund for the purpose of investing in a shell at one of our performance centers that is what we are discussing okay but if you don't have the workers that can connect people to these services that have the training and ability  you're giving money to [ORGANIZATION].
01_30_2020,affordable housing,"Through this engagement, more than 1,000 people provided meaningful input. I'd like to recognize [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], and [ORGANIZATION], and everyone who helped shape this engagement and encouraged robust participation. Through this engagement, we heard specific recommendations like those you see reflected here for affordable housing or active community space."
01_30_2020,affordable housing,"Building on the framework plan, our vision includes a firm commitment to 720 affordable housing units, in the site and adjacent to the district's central amenities. We've planned for community space for programming and for public art that will honor and reflect the history of this neighborhood while celebrating and empowering [ORGANIZATION]'s diverse communities. We've committed to creating opportunities that foster wealth creation for diverse local businesses and to pursuing property investment and ownership structures to increase asset development for communities of color."
01_30_2020,affordable housing,"We are deeply appreciative of the partners that have walked with us thus far. We want to recognize the enormous investment of time and talent by our city partners from [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, [PERSON], [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION], ORG6, and ORG7. From an affordable housing strategy to planning for open space, the green loop or [STREET] designs, to detailed engineering and financing discussions about utility upgrades, construction or procurement for the city's infrastructure investments."
01_30_2020,affordable housing,"Since [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and ORG2 have met to negotiate a community benefits agreement that will reflect both public and private commitments. We are currently working on reaching tentative agreement on a term sheet that would speak to construction equity, operations, affordable housing, sustainability, business equity, teneting and oversight. And finally, public infrastructure and affordable housing land transfer commitments will be executed via individual intergovernmental agreements, and these agreements will detail funding and finance responsibilities by public and private partners, relevant elements of the community benefits agreements and delivery expectations."
01_30_2020,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] will speak separately to the capital required to deliver on affordable housing, so that's not included in this chart. The yellow portion that is currently [ORGANIZATION] represents those particular community benefits that will require additional investment with tools outside of the city or private sectors conventional means. And will need to be found from either land sales, being invested in these community benefits, or bringing other additional resources to bear."
01_30_2020,affordable housing,"And then [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] will hold hearings on the master plan and will bring the key development disposition agreement, community benefits agreement, and intergovernmental agreement term sheets to you for your consideration. We're also moving forward with the interim activation plan, relocating the ORG1 retail to the adjacent garage, and pursuing demolition of the vacant buildings. So with that, I'd like to hand it over to ORG2 to discuss the affordable housing strategy."
01_30_2020,affordable housing,"The affordable housing we create will be for families who make less than 60% of area median income. For a three person family, that would mean a household who makes less than 47,000 or [DATE]. That would be housing that's affordable for people like preschool teachers, service workers, or seniors on a fixed income."
01_30_2020,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] is committed to achieving 720 units of affordable housing within the [ORGANIZATION] corridor. The strategy to achieve this goal is twofold. First, to provide land and ORG1 financing to affordable housing owners and developers."
01_30_2020,affordable housing,"And secondly, to use inclusionary housing. Market rate developers within the corridor will be bound to meet their inclusionary housing requirements at 60% of area median income. While the number of units to be created through direct financing and inclusionary housing has fluxed over time, our commitment to create 720 units of affordable housing has remained constant."
01_30_2020,affordable housing,"Guided by these values, we selected an entire city block alongside the new park in the heart of the corridor to create two separate and distinct new developments. This parcel selection also has the benefit of ensuring we can create affordable housing in the first phase of development. In combination, we believe this block will allow for the creation of 440 units of affordable housing."
01_30_2020,affordable housing,"In addition to this block, with input from [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] and ORG2 have identified two additional parcels for affordable housing development. ORG3 has offered to co-develop the FAC0 parcel in a mixed-use development or alternatively to use a portion of the ORG3-owned site at FAC1 Based on current market assumptions and the present plan for development of market rate units in the corridor, we estimate that ORG2 will be contributing just over 30% of the overall financing needed to reach our 720-unit goal, with private capital contributing approximately 70% of the total cost. Thank you."
01_30_2020,affordable housing,"We do anticipate as soon as we are able to put out the southern portion, which is largely residential, we would anticipate that there will be, in addition to local affordable housing developers, that there will be other developers who will come in. [ORGANIZATION] has not expressed an interest in the southern part of it, and so I think you're gonna see a mixture. Just know that I'm going to continue to ask that question every time you come to me with this project, okay?"
01_30_2020,homeless,"Because for us, we say it was not as the mayor said, it was not about the project, it was not about the building or the development, it was always centered and focused on the people. particularly people that usually doesn't benefit from these projects. We listen construction workers, business owners, displaced residents, homeless, people with disabilities, kids."
01_30_2020,affordable housing,"We're also looking forward to the following components of the vertical construction of the project, specifically affordable housing. Affordability continues to be a concern for [ORGANIZATION] for our members and for communities of color in [ORGANIZATION]. The [ORGANIZATION], the [ORGANIZATION] Housing Bureau's own state of housing report states, there are no neighborhoods in [ORGANIZATION] affordable to single moms or to black families."
01_30_2020,affordable housing,"Given the history of intentional displacement of indigenous, black, Chinese, and Japanese residents from this area, and given the city's recent acknowledgement of that intentional displacement, we at the [ORGANIZATION] are also advocating for a racial preference to be considered for the housing units as a concrete step toward remediating these historic injustices. We affirm our ability to problem solve when we build intentional relationships with one another. We affirm our values as a community that's committed to racial justice, which is demonstrated through clear definitions of good quality jobs and maximizing the opportunities to build affordable housing and for businesses."
01_30_2020,affordable housing,"In fact, if it's done right and it's done with those supports to small firms and it really is truly important for us to lift up those wages for all folks. I mean, when I think about the, conversation about affordable housing and the folks that we serve and the fastest [STREET] for them to get secure housing and to be you know fully living in this community and thriving is through a good job with a good wage and benefits we are not going to do that if we continue to low [STREET] All right. And we're happy to follow up and provide that research and have additional conversations if that's beneficial."
01_30_2020,housing crisis,"The effect of that is to create a permanent use, which is really what they want, [ORGANIZATION] is more than generous, and we would have to be concerned about the precedent then. PERSON0 and I have not really argued the legal case that was made before the hearings officer. This is not really an allowable conditional use, but allowing it would be a precedent for converting housing stock to office use in the city, which is about the worst thing we could do in light of the current housing crisis."
01_03_2018,houseless,"Oh, this is loud [ORGANIZATION]. It's freezing outside, yet the houseless remain on the streets in pain, suffering in the cold, hungry, and some perhaps about to medicate themselves to death because the weight of sorrow breaks hearts. DATE1."
01_03_2018,houseless,"Buses should be used to escort houseless people who agree to go to shelters with their belongings and their animals. All city vehicles should be used to go out to locate houseless people to see if they are okay, in need of emergency care, or if they want shelter to escort them.  that the mayor should go onto all media and request that all churches and places of worship open their doors to allow people in. I asked the mayor to collect a database of volunteer doctors and medics for on-call duty during the crisis and a database of volunteers who could person shelters during the crisis then and now."
01_03_2018,houseless,"The response was far less than what I consider humane. We got a one-room shelter downtown, one in [ORGANIZATION], no thanks to the city, and one in [ORGANIZATION]. DATE0, our first houseless person died that we know of [LOCATION]."
01_03_2018,houseless,Fill the bank foreclosed houses with houseless. Fill empty rooms in hotels. Change the paradigm of what affordable is.
01_03_2018,houseless,"Let's get real about it. In [ORGANIZATION], the council wasted precious time trying to shut me down, my voice, the voices of all activists in [ORGANIZATION], that the houseless suffered all the [STREET] to their deaths. Because you chose not to do the right thing, because you chose to vilify activists, because you chose to talk about us and bully us about our public testimony on [ORGANIZATION], because you chose to waste time, now we have our first [ORGANIZATION]."
01_03_2018,houseless,"No name, no answer, it's just a houseless person dead on the streets. The city council will continue to applaud itself for doing the least rather than the most, and people will continue to die. People will vilify activists, our voices, for fighting back, for fighting back to maintain our rights, fighting back against police aggression, brutality, and murder, for fighting back against commissioners who think that no laws apply to them."
01_03_2018,houseless,We will fight back. We will not stop. ORG0 the houseless.
01_03_2018,houseless,"Deal with the cops. Deal with this reality. No name, no answers, just a houseless person dead on the streets."
01_03_2018,homeless,"We have a homeless outreach team that goes out [ORGANIZATION], takes food, shelter, clothing, food and clothing, and also hygiene packets out throughout the city. We also provide meals, hot meals, and food baskets out of our outreach emergency food program as well. So a lot's happening and a lot's going on."
01_03_2018,houseless,"We were hoping to see some information about the houseless and the people living on our streets under this emergency. We realize this is a grant, has limitations, but we didn't see anything. Here's our problem."
01_03_2018,houseless,This is a grant for [ORGANIZATION] to be able to respond on behalf of all of us to emergencies in our community. That includes houseless people as well as those who are out. Can you straighten out 211?
01_03_2018,affordable housing,"One is an unusually high number of retirements.  partly because of people aging out of their positions, partly because of uncertainty around PERS. There's a whole host of reasons, but we have had a tremendous brain drain, which we are now in the process of hiring for. Second, as my colleagues know, there was a huge crush of work [ORGANIZATION] at the development services, in part because of concerns that under proposed changes to federal law, certain things would be forfeited, particularly in the area of affordable housing development."
01_03_2018,homeless,"If they really need case management because they are homeless and they have no identification, they haven't had regular access to health care, our case manager focuses on that. If they really need the chemical dependency, their addiction is the primary thing we focus on that. So we really do tailor it to"
01_08_2015,affordable housing,"Under affordable housing, on page three, you requested that inclusionary zoning be elevated to a top city priority. And also included is support for the use of state bonds to fund affordable housing as proposed in the governor's recommended budget. Next, at Commissioner [PERSON]'s request, the Children's District Initiative has been removed."
02_08_2017,homeless,"It was also struck down. PERSON0, right here in federal [STREET], said that to sweep when the shelter is full is cruel and unusual punishment, which contravenes the Constitution, which you're sworn to uphold. Another issue I have is the homeless count."
02_08_2017,homeless,"I submitted a few papers, so I won't go into details on that. But you've got 12,000 people on the streets  7,000 people, [ORGANIZATION] has said that they're teaching that are homeless. Over there in the county, she said that they put 2,000 people in housing [ORGANIZATION]."
02_08_2017,homeless,"So obviously, the count of the homeless is woefully inadequate by a factor of five. So if you want to solve a problem, you have to understand the magnitude of the problem. There are 12,000 people on the streets."
02_08_2017,homeless,Nobody here is responsible for homeless. Somebody's responsible for housing. Nobody's responsible for homeless.
02_08_2017,homeless,"I hate to be such a broken record, but out of respect for the fact that we have two new council members and a new head of [ORGANIZATION], I wanted to present a brief compare-contrast between what we've been doing and large-scale bunk housing. First off, in a subtle yet important [STREET], [PERSON] used to provide a third option to those homeless people besides being criminalized outside or treated like prisoners in missions. Secondly, consider that perhaps where the ORG2 went wrong is that they, like everywhere else, they tried to build walls and give people privacy."
02_08_2017,homeless,"Now, I love homeless people, but...  There's a reason why many missions don't put doors on the front of their bathroom stalls. You give privacy and that sends a signal to drug users that come in and abuse the [STREET]. Furthermore, walls give room for bugs to crawl through, things to accumulate."
02_08_2017,homelessness,"And mostly that magical space sitting in the vertical direction above our heads at [TIME] has gone entirely unused, meaning the rent has not been divided by two. Lastly, homelessness is in part a social phenomenon and many people need options rather than help. I'm kind of running out of time here, so I'm skipping stuff."
02_08_2017,houseless,"Shame on this council that you would sit here and listen to this for all of this time And you can't even give us a meeting about the houseless. We have emailed all of you, and you [ORGANIZATION]'s office sat with us for [TIME] and took notes and wasted our time and didn't present them to you."
02_08_2017,homeless,"You got interrupted, and that wasn't fair. About putting homeless housing up at FAC0. Actually, I was more in favor of putting [ORGANIZATION] near FAC1  I like the fact that there's a lot of natural science."
02_08_2017,homeless,"And if you're going to do...  housing for the homeless, do it near FAC0. I mean, there's a lot of train tracks there. There was a plan to put a Right to Dream Tour near FAC0."
02_08_2017,homeless,"At the time of the flood, when the berm and the railroad berm broke, 18,000 people were homeless within [ORGANIZATION]. Where did they go? What happened to them?"
02_08_2017,homelessness,"as we witnessed and we know, housing homelessness, displacement, and also it's interesting when we point to discovering the stories because the stories have been here, we just haven't been listening, right? So I feel that... As a co-director of [ORGANIZATION], our main intent, although we are artist-led, we're community-driven."
02_18_2015,affordable housing,"The mayor and [ORGANIZATION] will be looking at the issue of deconstruction, not just of single-family homes, but of multi-family homes. Hopefully Commissioner [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] will be looking into the issue of should there be a surcharge on demolitions in order to help pay for affordable housing. And then [ORGANIZATION], again, will be working with our direct subcommittee on a number of other issues following up from this process."
02_18_2015,homeless,"That's what we don't want. You have a lot of homeless people in these parks, right? You have to figure out a [STREET] that you're not going to put them in jail."
02_18_2015,homeless,And you know who they are? They're homeless. It's the last vice they have.
02_18_2015,homeless,"Regardless of what we do with the amendment making part of having a [STREET] to have neighborhood associations participating in small areas, there's a great risk that this legislation will be used in an unfair [STREET] so that when we see a transient homeless person on a park bench,  They can be harassed out of the park and then harassed off the sidewalk. And some of these people are harassed to the point where they become part of the suicide statistics or we find them dead on our streets. So I love clean air."
02_18_2015,homelessness,"And our nation is worse off for it. We suffer more inequality, more poverty, more homelessness, more despair. And locally, we have the ability to do something about it."
02_18_2015,homelessness,"The city of [ORGANIZATION] plays a critical role in our economy as an employer, as a steward of our tax dollars, as a public expression of our values, and as a model for sustainable economic policies. We can set a much-needed floor to hold up wages and living standards for families in the community. One of the terrible outcomes of low pay is child homelessness."
02_18_2015,homelessness,"however we can. We are fighting poverty, addiction, mental illness, homelessness, shoulder to shoulder with you. I ask that you help in assuring all of our my sisters and brothers will not have to live in poverty [ORGANIZATION]."
02_18_2015,affordable housing,"So there's a responsibility at [ORGANIZATION] that we have to start addressing affordable housing issues as well. Of course, the state makes our job a little bit difficult with preempting us on minimum wage issues, rent control, if that was even an option to be used, and also inclusionary zoning. But that doesn't mean that we don't have policy options."
02_18_2015,homeless,"If that's not a crisis, I don't know what is. This kind of dismal economic reality doesn't just impact the low-wage workers themselves. When workers are forced to go on social services, the repercussions are felt throughout the local economy, from an increase in the homeless population, to mental health issues, to the dismal condition of our city's streets, and by extension, a community that resists taxation as a matter of survival."
02_18_2015,homelessness,"There are other agencies here in [ORGANIZATION] that operate with 83% of the earnings going to the company and 16% to the worker. These conditions are poverty wages, and they put all CNAs at risk for homelessness DATE0 because there are no caps on rental costs. There are no guarantees that shifts are offered beyond [LOCATION] time out."
02_18_2015,homelessness,"But [ORGANIZATION] lead-in time is too long when we face [PERSON] occurrences of possible homelessness. Mr. [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION] members, thank you for hearing us DATE2. In [LOCATION], we have elections."
02_18_2015,homeless,"They're working in the detox facility at [ORGANIZATION], dealing with people recovering from heroin addiction and other addiction services. They're janitors. They're female treatment assistants, helping people with young children that have been born to drug-addicted parents, as well as in transition projects...  incorporated, they're really just taking care of our homeless people."
02_18_2015,homeless,"Everything is a lifeline for homeless, everything, including the parks. And when you take that away, then you're going to see a real large jump in suicide rate, and that's not going to be good. I don't think you're trying hard enough."
01_07_2015,homeless,"Number four. Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel regarding homeless issues. Ms. [PERSON], come on up."
01_07_2015,homelessness,"I thought you were gonna talk about a blue ribbon committee. That was the low-hanging fruit Let's let's move on to time certain number six  [ORGANIZATION] subrecipient contract with [ORGANIZATION] for $492,273 for housing vulnerable adults and outreach and housing placement to veterans and people experiencing homelessness in [ORGANIZATION] east of the [PERSON] city limits. And could you also read 7 and [DATE] as well?"
01_07_2015,homeless,"7, authorize subrecipient contract with [ORGANIZATION] for $110,000 for housing placement services for women  And number eight, amend intergovernmental agreement with [ORGANIZATION] for $355,000 for the homeless family system of care program. Commissioner [PERSON]. Thank you, Mr. [PERSON]."
01_07_2015,homelessness,"In [ORGANIZATION] budget, [ORGANIZATION] allocated an additional $500,000 in new ongoing funds to additional services for people experiencing homelessness. Through a competitive process...  which emphasized the priority populations identified in a home for everyone, including women, families, vulnerable adults, and veterans, as well as increasing access for people of color, three programs were selected for funding. The first is [ORGANIZATION], which will work with ORG2, [PERSON], [LOCATION], and [ORGANIZATION],  to transition [ADDRESS] into permanent housing."
01_07_2015,homeless,"The second is [ORGANIZATION]. We will build on its success of partnerships that it has, which rely heavily on culturally specific providers to move 66 households into permanent housing, including 15 who have experienced domestic violence. The third investment is [PERSON] and ORG2, which will continue their innovative partnership with ORG3  to permanently house 38 individuals."
01_07_2015,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] is a ORG1 program that places homeless, non-parenting women in permanent housing and then offers ongoing support for housing retention and community engagement. Our program operates a [ORGANIZATION] drop-in center, women only, where women can access basic services like showers and laundry and food. It's also where we begin our relationship building with people so that we house them and have an ongoing relationship with them for often DATE1."
01_07_2015,homeless,"Through this initiative, housing transitions will be able to [STREET] at least 10 older homeless women in permanent housing, and [ORGANIZATION] will ensure their ability to have income, provide valuable assistance to other community programs, and to maintain their housing on their own. ORG1 engages faith communities in providing programs and services to formerly homeless individuals. We have partnered with ORG2 in our [PERSON] program, which engages volunteers to provide practical assistance and health information to formerly homeless individuals and to improve their overall health, and also to engage in community after placement."
01_07_2015,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] provides volunteer-driven social activities, giving the women a richer life, reducing the isolation women often experience after moving indoors, and enhancing housing retention. [ORGANIZATION] expects to house at least 40 homeless women through this initiative, and we're so grateful to you for giving us the opportunity to do so. Thank you."
01_07_2015,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION], you want to talk about the homeless family system? Yes. Well, good morning, and we want to actually thank you so very much for this opportunity."
01_07_2015,homeless,"Not only [ORGANIZATION], but [PERSON], ORG2, [PERSON], [LOCATION]. Goodness, am I forgetting something? No, I'm not."
01_07_2015,homelessness,"That's it, I think. Anyway, we're all just very, very excited about the opportunity. There are so many, especially communities of color, that struggle with homelessness, and in such a [STREET] that it's a little bit different."
01_07_2015,homeless,"he had something on his record and and our one of our homeless team members was able to you know make communication with that district and talk to him about the situation and ask them to if they could reduce the feed to so that they could pay the fee and be able to let that go and get his id and get his get be able to get into housing it was an amazing thing that it just took [ORGANIZATION]  for them to be able to do that. And that's something we didn't even think about that could happen, but this is the things that our mobile housing team are thinking about, like how do we do this? How do we eliminate problems that are legal issues or that are back rent from who knows when or something that happened [DATE] to help these families get into housing?"
01_07_2015,homeless,How do I explain this situation? And sometimes this is obviously with families who have never been homeless in their lives and they didn't know what to do next. So it's a really amazing opportunity to have all of these team members working together and figuring out how do we best serve the people in the city of [ORGANIZATION].
01_07_2015,homeless,"To date, going back to the origins of this funding, we've helped [ADDRESS] and into stable housing. Those are safe places where they can explore other interests and add value to their life. And I'd like to share a story of one individual who,  man named [PERSON] who's been homeless for or had been homeless for [ORGANIZATION] in inner [ORGANIZATION] regular at st [PERSON] dining hall we'd connected with him [PERSON] and I  The extent of his challenges were so pervasive that about all he could remember day to day was the name of his joint outreach worker."
01_07_2015,homeless,"He was preyed upon repeatedly, and as that victim of crime had so many interactions with public safety, and it's something that we don't normally think about in terms of how homeless people interact with public safety. They're victims of crime as well. And so using funding in this initiative, we were able to connect with a [ORGANIZATION] mental health worker who was then able to leverage [ORGANIZATION]'s other resources around mental health services and find him placement at [ORGANIZATION], where he's able to access really supportive community group therapies and services."
01_07_2015,homeless,"Some of our chronic homeless and camping issues, I can still vividly remember [TIME] being at FAC0 issuing multiple citations and taking a very enforcement approach at that time with very little consideration about where do people go or where do they need to go and how are their needs met. And I'm embarrassed by that because I think that was out of ignorance on my part. Thank you."
01_07_2015,homelessness,"to not only get people into housing and the story of [ORGANIZATION] that we just heard and so many others, which I can relate on a personal level from our officers' experience, but I'm now able to direct our officers who are trying to balance community needs, criminal behavior with also people that are just in need of assistance or experiencing homelessness or mental health or drug and alcohol addiction, all the things that play into this. We're able to actually provide resources. DATE0 when I was out there, I didn't have any idea who existed and where to direct people."
01_07_2015,homeless,"The homeless family system operates countywide. All right, but then why do you have city limits in there?"
01_07_2015,homeless,"Again, Commissioner [PERSON], I want to commend you on your efforts on this. Any money directed toward the homeless situation is positive in this city or [ORGANIZATION]. A concern I had originally on this is just to make sure that the funds for [ORGANIZATION], since they do also have a surplus...  are being paid from [ORGANIZATION] on the east side where it's necessary to do that."
01_07_2015,homeless,We're making great changes pertaining to the homeless. I think we're making great strides. I think that we need to keep focusing on the addictions that a lot of people do have and  We need to offer better treatment.
01_07_2015,homeless,I want it focused on the suicide prevention aspect of this. We need to understand that a high percentage of homeless people that are heroin addicts do commit suicide. It goes down the list of meth addicts.
01_07_2015,homelessness,"They've been displaced out of their homes, from their jobs, from their friends, and when they're out on the sidewalks, out on the streets, they're looking for more positive solutions, which the speakers have stated they want to go in that direction. Again, Mayor, I'm going to compliment you on the bigger picture of homelessness because I was listening to a, it's called [ORGANIZATION]. It's where some of the founders of certain companies in other states go and have discussions."
01_07_2015,homeless; homelessness; affordable housing,"And [ORGANIZATION] from [ORGANIZATION] at that meeting said that because of Mayor [PERSON], I'm looking at doing more things toward affordable housing and also the most vulnerable people in the city. That is the biggest direction that we need to have is people coming into this city, understanding if we talk shared economy, we need to also understand the homeless communities are part of the economy, and you begin to share that responsibility also. That's what was stated, and if we can continue to do that from the get-go, we're going to end chronic homelessness in this city, and we will maintain chronic homelessness.  chronic homelessness from [ORGANIZATION] and let these other services step in and provide the service they need."
01_07_2015,homelessness,Ending chronic homelessness can be a reality with the right people brought in and the right resources from these other companies that are billion-dollar companies coming into this city and stating that they're listening to you close on the issues of homelessness. Thank you. Could you give us afterwards the reference to where this gentleman –  said what you've just quoted?
01_07_2015,homelessness,"He stated that as a direction he'd like to look into to be part of the solutions through this city. There's no other commitments there, and I respect that he's at least thinking about it, looking at it, and determining how they want to spend the resources in this city. That changes the whole dynamics of homelessness through this city to have people do that before they enter with their businesses."
01_07_2015,affordable housing,"Well, Commissioner [PERSON] has proposed we take 100 percent of the revenue from [ORGANIZATION] and we address affordable housing, which I support. And if the president of the company believes he wants to use some of his revenues –  to help address affordable housing, I think we could potentially have a marriage made in heaven. So I'll pull it up."
01_07_2015,homelessness,"Your numbers might be a little bit high, but their intent to look at it and address those issues is one of the most positive things that we can have going forward in this city. And it will change the dynamics of ending chronic homelessness. Thank you."
01_07_2015,homeless,"My name is [ORGANIZATION]. And I don't know which is a more contentious phrase around here, [ORGANIZATION] or [ORGANIZATION] versus the city of [PERSON] for the conduct of the [PERSON] [INSTITUTION]. But it was encouraging to hear the officers' words about improvements in interactions with homeless people and people in distress here."
01_07_2015,homelessness,"Obviously, these funds need to be released. You need to vote yes on these items. We need to have a more comprehensive number and fact-based discussion that what happens with [ORGANIZATION] or [PERSON] at ORG2 and [PERSON] and [LOCATION] and [ORGANIZATION]."
01_07_2015,homeless; homelessness,"I would like to address a few issues that I see, and what I see is from certain enforcement individuals, a culture of hate against people that are experiencing homelessness. And there's a brutality that is used to intimidate people  and more or less, I don't like to use the word, but terrorize people that are homeless. And I see this, and I see the effects of this, and this is not good."
01_07_2015,homeless,But this has to stop. And I would also like to say that we should make it a hate crime for anybody to beat up on homeless people just because they're homeless. Yes.
01_07_2015,homeless,"Money to the homeless, you know, it's not going to hurt them. There's certain things that people know what to do with money, and money is a shortage right now for people. People aren't going to be clamoring over the borders trying to get over here because it's so good for homeless folks."
01_07_2015,affordable housing,"So we're not likely to see more federal dollars, and that's one of the reasons why I will support Commissioner [PERSON]'s proposal in the regular budget that we take $[ADDRESS] we're going to solve this problem is to increase the supply of affordable housing. There is a shortage. We must attack it from the point of view of adding to the supply, and I think [PERSON] has the right idea with the [ORGANIZATION], and I will support that during the budget cycle."
01_07_2015,homelessness; houseless,"And when it's been pointed out that Commissioner [PERSON], who many of us think is sometimes being too pro-business, is honest and sincere enough to say, there's a supply problem, we have to make housing. So without talking to the latest concerns about  the budget overruns. I do want to say if we have massive 300% budget overruns or 200% budget overruns, I hope they always happen in providing homelessness to houseless and underhoused people in the future instead of [ORGANIZATION]."
01_07_2015,houseless,"We need people on the ground engaging people where they are. That means where houseless people are, where grassroots African-American youth are hanging out. And I love Judge [PERSON], but I don't think he's a grassroots outreach person."
01_10_2018,homeless,"It appears to me that the council is attempting to change the laws of physics by stating a home floating on a river is an impervious surface. Specifically around the roof, yes, but everything that falls on the roof immediately goes into the river. Raising the costs of homeownership and renters, many who are on fixed incomes, will only make the problem of the ongoing homeless crisis worse, as many of these people are being directly impacted by this raise."
02_12_2020,homeless,"First off, I have to commend you for your composure. So DATE0 I'm here again to talk about the Yes, [ORGANIZATION], The Homeless Cure. And how I plan to socially and financially support the 400 acre lifestyle farm."
02_12_2020,homeless,"Before I begin, I would like to call attention to the importance of the plan. This plan has the capability to house and rehabilitate over 7,000 homeless and underachievers in [ORGANIZATION]. The only worthy plan out there is FAC0, and they can hold up to 100 per night and up to 300 in [LOCATION]."
02_12_2020,homeless,"Their 1,500 compared to this 7,000 plan is gigantic. And then if you add that we have 38,000 homeless on top of that, What we have in order right now, what we're working on right now, can't even house the increase, let alone the existing 38,000. So obviously, we're in big trouble over that."
02_12_2020,homeless; homelessness,"So [PERSON] and you, the city, could adapt this plan, [ORGANIZATION], so that we can assure to end homelessness and not just provide another shelter, but rehabilitation as well. I think that they would marry well together. As I've mentioned before, I'm looking for just the right groups or individuals to lead and support and end to [ORGANIZATION]'s homeless crisis."
02_12_2020,homeless,"Also non-profits, individuals like [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], which you'll see coming up in your mailings for several walks in the downtown, very friendly walks about just recognizing the need to really take this on head on and fix this issue. The business partners can open satellite stores within the village, offering on-the-job training in personal and trade skills. These newly gained trade skills will become a part of the villagers' employment resumes."
02_12_2020,homeless,"Philanthropists and foundations and people who are passionate about helping people in need fundraise and donate. Finally, [ORGANIZATION]. The challenge group consists of everyone who works, lives, or plays in the downtown."
02_12_2020,homelessness,"These groups will be asked to contact and gather their brothers and sisters to join in the walk against homelessness. Now, how can the government help? I ask that you suspend your present efforts towards homelessness, saving millions, and shift those dollars to mental health and addiction."
02_12_2020,affordable housing,"FAC0 and [ORGANIZATION], a lot that I have. There was an old hotel located there [ORGANIZATION]. I just want to share with you the site, with you again, for any housing needs, like short-term housing for camps like FAC1 or future long-term affordable housing units."
02_12_2020,homelessness,"Some bureaus may not have, even if they have revenue, they may not have sources of funding that allow them to use it for this purpose. And so there might be, we're also recommending that [ORGANIZATION] may set additional eligibility and priorities and that bureaus can further set them unique to their situation. They could include for example people who do not have bus passes from work or school, people who have experienced homelessness or houselessness and people who do not have flexible work schedules."
02_12_2020,affordable housing,Are you housing cost burdened? Do you live in regulated affordable housing? Do you qualify for food stamps?
02_12_2020,homeless,"Are you homeless? Yes. are just a few off the top of my head that I think would be very reasonable criteria for receiving stipends. And then, now I've lost track of those five questions that you wanted us, okay."
02_12_2020,housing crisis; affordable housing,I feel that the arguments around livability and Title X are really grasping at straws. They're not meaningful to me whatsoever. We have an affordable housing crisis.
02_12_2020,affordable housing,"One house and let it be used for a non-residential purpose. One house that I don't know probably is worth $800,000 to a million dollars which is not going to provide anyone affordable housing is just not compelling to me. So I continue to support Commissioner [PERSON]'s motion."
02_12_2020,affordable housing,"This is going to allow non-profit and for-profit developers to build affordable housing in some of the city's most resource-rich neighborhoods. It's very important to me that we support family-sized affordable housing, so I'm glad to see that that's a possibility there. In their letter, [ORGANIZATION] asked us for this bonus as well as [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] waivers and property tax exemptions."
02_12_2020,affordable housing,"So I'm happy to see this progress on their request. [ORGANIZATION] also asked us to explore a fee in lieu for the deeper affordability bonus, focusing funds on affordable infill development and generating revenue from underdevelopment to build more affordable housing. So I would like to ask [PERSON] to look into these ideas further and meet with my staff as the amendment develops before it comes back to council."
02_12_2020,affordable housing,"From the beginning I was told that this was not an affordable housing program. That [ORGANIZATION] was about creating middle housing. And for [ORGANIZATION] we've been having this conversation, we've been very clear about that this project, I'm concerned, quite frankly, that it's not enough units for [ORGANIZATION] to actually be able to, unless they have a... like a block that they are going to be able to get the return on the investment."
02_12_2020,affordable housing,"I'm very concerned that we're trying to take a model that was not intended to provide affordable housing and squeeze affordable housing into it. The [STREET] we do it now is if you've got 40 units and four of them would have to be affordable based on our current criteria, I just don't know what we expect, how we expect to get... a good mix of affordable housing if we're going to be doing it one house at a time. Right?"
02_12_2020,affordable housing,And trying to create an affordable housing bonus inside a program that was very specifically about middle income housing. I think that's a disservice. It promises something that we will not be able to deliver in our lifetime.
02_12_2020,affordable housing,"And I'm much more interested in how do we make sure that we're building housing that people can afford to live in as compared to a couple here, a couple there. We need a lot more housing, and this is not going to get us to affordable housing or housing people can afford to live in. So I do not think this is a good amendment."
02_12_2020,affordable housing,"We heard this concept expressed by several community organizations, including affordable housing developers. And we also have a strong precedent in terms of adopting a similar amendment in better housing by design. And personally, I think it's important to keep the better housing by design and [ORGANIZATION] in alignment."
02_12_2020,affordable housing,"In my opinion, this concept offers a needed flexible approach for supporting developers who are being building affordable, and I would use capital A affordable housing throughout the city. While I'd like to see the concept define MFI at the lowest end of the income spectrum as possible, I also have to acknowledge that funding and financing options are limited and complicated for affordable housing development. Because of this, I do support the tiered approach, 60% MFI for [ORGANIZATION] for rental or 80% MFI for DATE1 ownership units."
02_12_2020,affordable housing,"Affordable housing developers such as [ORGANIZATION] have asked for this and said that they can build more housing with it And other than waiving fees for these affordable housing developers, I don't believe there's a cost to the city. Am I wrong? No, as the mayor said, the pro forma, if you look at the – PERSON0 with [ORGANIZATION], excuse me – All of these, both the 80% and the 60%, are going to take finance being brought by the nonprofit developer typically to deliver the unit."
02_12_2020,affordable housing,"I mean it would just be a missed opportunity to not try to serve the needs of affordable housing developers and even some private developers. I actually heard from a constituent recently whose he and his father is a landlord and kind of small-time developers, been doing that for [ORGANIZATION]. So they own some cheap dirt."
02_12_2020,affordable housing,"They're not spending $250,000 on an empty lot, and they're committed to affordable housing, and they thought that this incentive wouldn't be available to private developers, which I understand it is. It's just we don't think many of them will take advantage of it. That's correct."
02_12_2020,affordable housing,"Commissioner [PERSON]. I would appreciate that because after [ORGANIZATION] on [ORGANIZATION], who builds affordable housing for very low income families, I know what it takes for nonprofits to actually put a funding package together. And with few exceptions, I think it's a little challenging when you're talking about such few units because of how the financing works."
02_12_2020,affordable housing,It's not the affordable housing solution. It's just a tool that nonprofits could use. And in 43% of the city.
02_12_2020,affordable housing,"When [ORGANIZATION] ruled, I think in [ORGANIZATION], that it was unconstitutional to deny the sale of real estate to someone based on race, we saw cities across the country implement zoning codes and zoning codes became a proxy. Well, income became a proxy for race. And so I do think that there's an important [STREET] in this conversation for affordable housing."
01_07_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"In addition, that's when the bill stack will be introduced, so we'll have [ORGANIZATION] before the official kickoff of the session on [LOCATION] to really be able to dig through some of these pieces of legislation and what their impacts will be on the city. so turning first to the federal agenda the report you have before you is substantially similar to what was considered at the work session and includes that feedback that you provided to at the work session and subsequent to the to the session so the drafts have also been available on our website for public review there are eight top priorities leading with housing and homelessness  Two new priorities were added at your request, including gun violence prevention and federal protected sick time. So just going through the change memo you have before you, on page one of the agenda, the affordable housing section was amended to include a request of the administration so that local governments and we can have more flexibility about how we administer federal housing programs."
01_07_2016,homelessness,"And then on page seven, the domestic violence prevention item was updated to include a piece on preventing homelessness among victims of domestic violence. And lastly, a new item was added urging [ORGANIZATION] ratification of [ORGANIZATION], the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. So that's just a quick overview of the changes since the work session."
01_07_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,Just a couple concerns I have on this is that one of the issues that I have on the climate change is obvious issues.  that we want to divest in fossil fuel extraction companies. But I want to have a clear understanding that I want to start thinking more on where are we going to invest that money. And what I want to have an understanding is that I want to see divestment in fossil fuel extraction companies and investment in the affordable housing and homelessness companies.
01_07_2016,homelessness,"And I want to get thinking on that to start figuring out how we can do that with certain investment vehicles that will enable us to do that in the future. And why I say that, I want a smooth transitioning over from fossil fuel industry, but I also want to create jobs, create housing, and also decrease homelessness. And I want a little bit more thought put into that if I could possibly have that."
01_07_2016,homelessness,"So hello again and with me is [ORGANIZATION] our state government relations manager and [ORGANIZATION] our senior associate and Turning to the state legislative agenda again The draft is very similar to what was brought to you for the at the [ORGANIZATION] work session on  Again, the top priority in the state agenda is housing and homelessness. The four items in this priority, beginning with lifting the preemption on inclusionary zoning, request that the state give [ORGANIZATION] more authority to address needs locally and that they not further intrude on local decision-making."
01_07_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], I have a question on page one under affordable housing and homelessness. Under the lifting the preemption on inclusionary zoning, my sense is that we need to give you as broad a charge as possible since there's a lot of moving pieces here. Okay."
01_07_2016,affordable housing,"So in terms of the policies, there are a few that I think I would like to at least bring your attention to. 2C, use community benefits agreement as an anti-displacement tool that would help engage the community early to create developer agreements that benefit community members. 3C, create permanently affordable housing in market rate developments."
01_07_2016,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]. Man, DATE0 we look at these high rises go up. Is it possible that we could say that maybe 20 or 30 percent of those developments could be affordable housing to give some of our people that have been pushed out an opportunity to either come back and other folks who live in this area the opportunity to stay?"
01_07_2016,affordable housing,"We ask that you do this for [ORGANIZATION] because this is the community that belongs to us all and the kind of [STREET] that we say we want to live requires that we do certain things to reach our goals together. To do so, all of these policies or tools must be supported and in [STREET]. This means allowing funding streams to tie affordable housing to job training and placement through community benefit agreements, CBAs."
01_07_2016,affordable housing,"Density, apartment buildings without required parking and skinny houses by themselves don't solve affordable housing needs. Just ask my staff who work blocks from here but live in the numbers. Chapter three of the comp plan calls for coordinated housing, economic development and public facility plans and investments to create an integrated community development approach to restore communities impacted by past decisions."
01_07_2016,affordable housing,I want you to vote to restore and strengthen communities harmed by gentrification and displacement. I want you to vote to expand access to affordable housing city wide. I want you to vote to make [ORGANIZATION] great.
01_07_2016,affordable housing,"In this spirit, we must remind the city that increasing density without also proactively preventing displacement and better supporting tenants in this city would simply reproduce the injustices of the past. As such,  As such, we continue to support policies that incentivize the construction of affordable housing units and much stronger renter protections as a whole. A city that depends on growing through displacing working persons of color and families and its most vulnerable residents cannot in any sense of the word call itself sustainable."
01_07_2016,homeless,"I'm a [ORGANIZATION] native [ORGANIZATION] resident who lived [PERSON] of my life in stable, secure homes. I'm a single mother, single African-American mother of one child and graduate of [ORGANIZATION]. My experience also includes assisting homeless families with obtaining and maintaining housing."
01_07_2016,homeless,"I have worked the front lines holding several positions serving the homeless population, at-risk youth, those with addictions, along with the mentally and physically disabled for [ORGANIZATION]. I have worked in social services for [ORGANIZATION] in gentrification, aka re-urbanization, aka displacement,  has been a serious concern of mine, such a concern that I completed a study on gentrification and the impact that displacement has on native northeast [ORGANIZATION] residents as a college senior thesis DATE2. In my experience growing up as a native northeast [ORGANIZATION] resident, I can recall having great neighbors and streets to play in as a child prior to the major boom of trendy bars, boutiques, restaurants, and other businesses that cater to the middle class hipster and the cultural needs of...  those other than those other than the people of color."
01_07_2016,affordable housing,"After vacating my beloved home experience, I was unable to find available affordable housing within inner [ORGANIZATION] after finding work again. I had no choice but to move back to the same area within [ORGANIZATION] that I ran so quickly from. The loss of our beloved [ORGANIZATION] home was due to underemployment and unavailable affordable housing within inner northeast [PERSON]."
01_07_2016,affordable housing,"I saw firsthand when I tried to apply for a [STREET] to stay, I've applied for 30 places in [ORGANIZATION]. Most of the barriers that I've run into are some of the same barriers that other African Americans are running into trying to find affordable housing. I ran into the barrier of where most of the people were asking for three times the income just to qualify for a $900 apartment."
01_07_2016,houseless,"You've got good policies in the plan, but we don't see design as a frill. Obviously, it creates beauty when it's done well, but thoughtful design also recognizes and creates opportunities for greater sustainability, better functionality, and the best use of limited resources.  whether it be for tiny houses, temporary shelter for our houseless neighbors, seamless compatible infill in our residential neighborhoods, or adaptive reuse and new growth along our commercial corridors. Design makes the difference in all those places."
01_07_2016,affordable housing,"I'm a third-generation property owner, and my daughters live in the area, and so they will follow in my footsteps. I've been in communication with [ORGANIZATION] and with [ORGANIZATION]. And I'm aware of the affordable housing issues, commercial space issues, common area plaza, and curb appeal, and parking issues."
01_07_2016,housing crisis,"I am testifying [TIME] so that you can hear how these restrictions have placed an unnecessary, unfair, and even discriminatory burden on small business owners. Clearly, these outdated...  code restrictions were meant to protect homeowners' property value. The defense that ADUs are somehow meant to address [ORGANIZATION]'s housing crisis, both in terms of availability and affordability, belies the city's decision to allow ADUs to be rented as [ORGANIZATION]."
01_09_2019,houseless,"DATE0, I've learned a lot in [LOCATION] because I'm now more involved with helping friends in [ORGANIZATION]. What I learned...  ever since a couple city councils ago, was that the new response is that a notice will be posted in a certain amount of time before any houseless camp is swept away. Before DATE2, there was supposed to be a sweep [DATE] before DATE2 in [ORGANIZATION]."
01_09_2019,homeless,"Thank you. Thank you. Okay, what I want to say is the hallmarks of this project where you go in and you consult with the property owners, they are afforded –  that homeless people are not, and that is the right to be seen as a person before the law."
01_09_2019,homeless,"And when you're confronted with an engineering problem and transportation is very important and how it's all done is very important and how it affects people is very important, when you're talking about  social services and lack of housing and things that impact the homeless, you don't consult the homeless to find out what's going on with them and where the rubber is not meeting the [STREET] or how they're affected. And [ORGANIZATION]  If you do not know where I was [ORGANIZATION] and what I was doing, you won't know what I was talking about, but I went up to your office on [LOCATION] and I left a detailed record."
01_09_2019,homeless,"And I'm talking about...  homeless people who are affected by the services that don't exist or do  exist on paper but don't exist in reality and just the dysfunction of that. And here you were able to work with the property owners. If you worked more with homeless people in terms of directly in conversation with them about what works and what doesn't and what's on paper that  pretends to be there and is not there, you would have a more functional system."
01_09_2019,homeless,"Like, you got this system to work because you consulted the property owners. If you don't talk directly with homeless people, you're never going to fix the homeless problem. So [ORGANIZATION] might be surprised to hear, and thank you for your testimony, you might be surprised to hear I agree with you"
01_09_2019,homelessness,"And I do, in fact, spend a considerable amount of time meeting with, talking with, sharing, going to, and being present to understand the situation of people who are directly impacted by homelessness. So I appreciate that. I can, you know, if you read what I wrote to you, my written communication, you will see that services are called, you know, at the exact time and under the exact condition that are prescribed, and they do absolutely nothing."
01_09_2019,affordable housing,"Thank you. And then...  In a desire to also try to talk in plain English, the advantage that we would have is that we could possibly build more affordable housing or use the other resources that we have. We'll have more resources that we could then invest, right?"
01_09_2019,affordable housing,"As a result of that, and as a result of some advocacy by people like [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] and others,  We actually got a more robust investment in affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION], which was one of the dividends. But we also made a commitment to continue to partner with [ORGANIZATION] on shared use facilities. And an issue that I believe predated all of us on council was the urban center.  which was put together by very creative people in terms of financing and had money from all kinds of different pots."
01_09_2019,homeless,"I'm not the biggest enthusiasm of everybody that lives in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood, but any low-income people that live in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood, if they're going to get anything out of this, they should have access to an expanded community garden on these grounds that we're displacing homeless people from,  During, well, the talk is happening now, during [ORGANIZATION] when we're going to have the [STREET] and time count, and find out that what we have failed to do is keep this homeless village situated where it should have remained and increase the number of homeless villages throughout the city so we have less tarps being blown around in windstorms like we experienced [LOCATION], etc., As to whether there might be offered bicycle use there or something like that and costs, I think that given the location of the facility, if we're going to have any talk about any other use other than an expanded community garden for people in the overlooked neighborhood area and anybody that wants to commute to that area along the bike path,  you know, any funding for fancy bike uses or whatever, which should be a conversation that really comes after either [ORGANIZATION] or [PERSON] have talked to us about how much money they're willing to name this path [PERSON]. If they don't want to spend money to name it [PERSON], then it's just going to be a multi-use path that helps people get to community gardens."
01_17_2018,homeless,"And you want to know why that affects everybody, and it affects everyone. It's not just a homeless problem. I did a little bit of research here."
01_17_2018,homeless,"Okay? And like I said, it's not just a homeless problem. Hepatitis C is going, or [ORGANIZATION] is going crazy in [ORGANIZATION]."
01_17_2018,homeless,"They're fining people for feeding homeless people because they think that that's the problem. It starts there, but it spreads to the whole community. DATE0 I took a little survey of five homeless people, and they all said the showers down at FAC0 is the number one [STREET] where they're able to take showers."
01_17_2018,homeless,"You know, our city would be healthier and happier if we were able to provide this care for everyone in the community, not just, you know, homeless. But what if we have immigrants that come into our city and need extra help? You know, this needs to be open to everyone in the community."
01_17_2018,homeless,"I'm very married to this issue. You know, I've been homeless since [ORGANIZATION], almost by choice. I don't have a criminal record."
01_17_2018,homeless,"I'm not an alcoholic. I'm not a drug addict. I was disabled from [ORGANIZATION], and so that's why I ended up being homeless."
01_17_2018,homeless,"You know, I don't make enough income to pay for a rental or a room, but I fight every day to survive. And, you know, I'm so tired of the lack of dignity that is shown to the homeless community. And we are a community."
01_17_2018,homeless,"And just to underscore, I want to let you know we're also looking at piloting with private sector help some of the mobile units that [ORGANIZATION] is now experimenting with, in particular in [PERSON], both mobile shower units as well as mobile bathroom units. And what they're doing down there is they're taking their prototypes around to areas where homeless folks are known to congregate, and they're effectively measuring the results in the community. So we're very interested in that kind of a pilot here as well."
01_07_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"In addition, that's when the bill stack will be introduced, so we'll have [ORGANIZATION] before the official kickoff of the session on [LOCATION] to really be able to dig through some of these pieces of legislation and what their impacts will be on the city. so turning first to the federal agenda the report you have before you is substantially similar to what was considered at the work session and includes that feedback that you provided to at the work session and subsequent to the to the session so the drafts have also been available on our website for public review there are eight top priorities leading with housing and homelessness  Two new priorities were added at your request, including gun violence prevention and federal protected sick time.

And what I want to have an understanding is that I want to see divestment in fossil fuel extraction companies and investment in the affordable housing and homelessness companies.
01_07_2016,homelessness,"And I want to get thinking on that to start figuring out how we can do that with certain investment vehicles that will enable us to do that in the future. And why I say that, I want a smooth transitioning over from fossil fuel industry, but I also want to create jobs, create housing, and also decrease homelessness. And I want a little bit more thought put into that if I could possibly have that."
01_07_2016,homelessness,"So hello again and with me is [ORGANIZATION] our state government relations manager and [ORGANIZATION] our senior associate and Turning to the state legislative agenda again The draft is very similar to what was brought to you for the at the [ORGANIZATION] work session on  Again, the top priority in the state agenda is housing and homelessness. The four items in this priority, beginning with lifting the preemption on inclusionary zoning, request that the state give [ORGANIZATION] more authority to address needs locally and that they not further intrude on local decision-making."
01_07_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], I have a question on page one under affordable housing and homelessness. Under the lifting the preemption on inclusionary zoning, my sense is that we need to give you as broad a charge as possible since there's a lot of moving pieces here. Okay."
01_07_2016,affordable housing,"So in terms of the policies, there are a few that I think I would like to at least bring your attention to. 2C, use community benefits agreement as an anti-displacement tool that would help engage the community early to create developer agreements that benefit community members. 3C, create permanently affordable housing in market rate developments."
01_07_2016,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]. Man, DATE0 we look at these high rises go up. Is it possible that we could say that maybe 20 or 30 percent of those developments could be affordable housing to give some of our people that have been pushed out an opportunity to either come back and other folks who live in this area the opportunity to stay?"
01_07_2016,affordable housing,"We ask that you do this for [ORGANIZATION] because this is the community that belongs to us all and the kind of [STREET] that we say we want to live requires that we do certain things to reach our goals together. To do so, all of these policies or tools must be supported and in [STREET]. This means allowing funding streams to tie affordable housing to job training and placement through community benefit agreements, CBAs."
01_07_2016,affordable housing,"Density, apartment buildings without required parking and skinny houses by themselves don't solve affordable housing needs. Just ask my staff who work blocks from here but live in the numbers. Chapter three of the comp plan calls for coordinated housing, economic development and public facility plans and investments to create an integrated community development approach to restore communities impacted by past decisions."
01_07_2016,affordable housing,I want you to vote to restore and strengthen communities harmed by gentrification and displacement. I want you to vote to expand access to affordable housing city wide. I want you to vote to make [ORGANIZATION] great.
01_07_2016,affordable housing,"In this spirit, we must remind the city that increasing density without also proactively preventing displacement and better supporting tenants in this city would simply reproduce the injustices of the past. As such,  As such, we continue to support policies that incentivize the construction of affordable housing units and much stronger renter protections as a whole. A city that depends on growing through displacing working persons of color and families and its most vulnerable residents cannot in any sense of the word call itself sustainable."
01_07_2016,homeless,"I'm a [ORGANIZATION] native [ORGANIZATION] resident who lived [PERSON] of my life in stable, secure homes. I'm a single mother, single African-American mother of one child and graduate of [ORGANIZATION]. My experience also includes assisting homeless families with obtaining and maintaining housing."
01_07_2016,homeless,"I have worked the front lines holding several positions serving the homeless population, at-risk youth, those with addictions, along with the mentally and physically disabled for [ORGANIZATION]. I have worked in social services for [ORGANIZATION] in gentrification, aka re-urbanization, aka displacement,  has been a serious concern of mine, such a concern that I completed a study on gentrification and the impact that displacement has on native northeast [ORGANIZATION] residents as a college senior thesis DATE2. In my experience growing up as a native northeast [ORGANIZATION] resident, I can recall having great neighbors and streets to play in as a child prior to the major boom of trendy bars, boutiques, restaurants, and other businesses that cater to the middle class hipster and the cultural needs of...  those other than those other than the people of color."
01_07_2016,affordable housing,"After vacating my beloved home experience, I was unable to find available affordable housing within inner [ORGANIZATION] after finding work again. I had no choice but to move back to the same area within [ORGANIZATION] that I ran so quickly from. The loss of our beloved [ORGANIZATION] home was due to underemployment and unavailable affordable housing within inner northeast [PERSON]."
01_07_2016,affordable housing,"I saw firsthand when I tried to apply for a [STREET] to stay, I've applied for 30 places in [ORGANIZATION]. Most of the barriers that I've run into are some of the same barriers that other African Americans are running into trying to find affordable housing. I ran into the barrier of where most of the people were asking for three times the income just to qualify for a $900 apartment."
01_07_2016,houseless,"You've got good policies in the plan, but we don't see design as a frill. Obviously, it creates beauty when it's done well, but thoughtful design also recognizes and creates opportunities for greater sustainability, better functionality, and the best use of limited resources.  whether it be for tiny houses, temporary shelter for our houseless neighbors, seamless compatible infill in our residential neighborhoods, or adaptive reuse and new growth along our commercial corridors. Design makes the difference in all those places."
01_07_2016,affordable housing,"I'm a third-generation property owner, and my daughters live in the area, and so they will follow in my footsteps. I've been in communication with [ORGANIZATION] and with [ORGANIZATION]. And I'm aware of the affordable housing issues, commercial space issues, common area plaza, and curb appeal, and parking issues."
01_07_2016,housing crisis,"I am testifying [TIME] so that you can hear how these restrictions have placed an unnecessary, unfair, and even discriminatory burden on small business owners. Clearly, these outdated...  code restrictions were meant to protect homeowners' property value. The defense that ADUs are somehow meant to address [ORGANIZATION]'s housing crisis, both in terms of availability and affordability, belies the city's decision to allow ADUs to be rented as [ORGANIZATION]."
01_23_2019,houseless,"If you are saying that interrupting your gathering for [TIME] to fight for some issue is bad, we very much disagree. I spend most of my time trying to stop these sweeps that murder houseless people on the streets. They take the very stuff that the [STREET] angels just gave them [ORGANIZATION] before."
01_23_2019,homeless,"People really like it. That use isn't even allowed anymore with the new zone, which is unfortunate. In that area, there's a lot of homeless people."
01_23_2019,homeless,"And homeless people and parents with kids aren't a good mix. I've been here before asking that city council allow the [INSTITUTION] to enforce laws and request the homeless people to pick up their tents and move, and that's what the law says they can do. When I ask the police to do that, they tell me that city council, specifically the mayor, has told them that they're not allowed to do that, they're not allowed to enforce the law."
01_23_2019,homelessness,"It is not the failure of the people who find that they cannot afford to live in a city where they work, worship, and go to school. Homelessness is not a crime. I understand that."
01_23_2019,houseless,"But I'm cleaning up poop and needles on my property [DATE]. I think what we need to do is find good ways for houseless people to be able to have sanitary access like the rest of us do. But again, I just don't think policing is the appropriate response to people who are houseless."
01_23_2019,homeless,"PERSON0 of [ORGANIZATION]. I think we all know what happened in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]. Okay."
01_23_2019,homeless,"I don't understand that. Like, I don't understand that [ORGANIZATION] made in his effort to become mayor saying he was going to house the homeless, and he still hasn't got it done. I need to remind you to stick to the relevant testimony."
01_23_2019,homeless; unhoused,"I understand, but you're going off track. These people  people would be deported without their legal representation. And I'm saying the homeless are unhoused because they do not have legal representation."
02_22_2017,affordable housing,"And in green is the average [ORGANIZATION] ridership on the [ORGANIZATION] streetcar. So very, very – oops, hang on a second – very, very direct connection to housing,  affordable housing and investment on the streetcar system with our ridership. And again, what we know from the ridership surveys that we've done is the people who are using the system are the people who live right on the system."
02_22_2017,affordable housing,"They want to move the people around to different locations, so it makes a lot of sense. I do want to see more affordable housings in the plan, not just a quarter, but up to 50% of affordable housing on the streetcar lanes. There's no reason why that can't be requested and implemented and create more workforce housing where corporations can come in and pay for that cost for that type of housing."
02_22_2017,affordable housing,"In [ORGANIZATION], I guess it was. What council intended was to waive the parking requirements for projects that provided on-site or off-site affordable housing, but not to waive the parking requirements for projects that paid a fee in lieu. I believe Commissioner [PERSON], this was your amendment at that time, the code amendment."
02_22_2017,homeless,"I didn't know what his animus towards me was, so I said, I didn't. Maybe I'm close to the [INSTITUTION], so I said, I'm not homeless. I don't know why I said that."
02_22_2017,homeless,"I believe there was, related to another allegation, but I didn't refresh on that for this meeting. And I would suspect that if it did come up that...  There was significant evidence that the appellant was putting his hands into his pockets and throwing things on the ground. I think the appellant said that he wanted to show his driver's license to prove who he was and that he wasn't homeless."
02_22_2017,homeless,"The situation escalated quickly, clearly. The complainant appeared to be afraid and perhaps panicked, based on emptying his pockets, asking what he had done, saying he wasn't homeless. I can imagine why he said that."
06_09_2016,homelessness,"The total general fund [ORGANIZATION] is $602 million, of which $501 million of that is discretionary. And the total [ORGANIZATION] in this adopted budget will be $3,065. You're all familiar with this as we've gone through the entire process, but the additional investments, I think it's worth just reminding folks that there is an additional over $30 million in money being invested in housing and homelessness, $11.5 million in city infrastructure, close to $7 million in public safety, and $4.5 million of parks, among some other key investments in this overall budget."
06_09_2016,homeless,"Fiscal oversight of this program will be provided by [ORGANIZATION], not [ORGANIZATION]. And then the last amendment is a motion to increase funding in ORG2 for homeless services, and this would increase intergovernmental revenues in ORG2, the home grant fund, by $321,634 to support homeless services. The federal grant funds have been awarded to the city and must be appropriated in the budget to be available for expenditure on [ORGANIZATION]."
06_09_2016,homeless,"PERSON0? This is a budget that, among other things, makes historic investments in housing and homeless services and also...  begins to address the staffing issues in [ORGANIZATION] by authorizing money for more staff for a bureau that is really overworked under staff. So I really appreciate the fact that we're able to do that."
06_09_2016,homelessness,"DATE0, it was transportation, and the mayor and Commissioner [PERSON] led the council in making substantial new investments in basic infrastructure. DATE1, it's housing and homelessness. And I'm proud, as my colleagues have all said, to be on a council which has said we're going to prioritize discretionary money to address this crisis on our streets."
06_09_2016,homelessness,"And without further ado, I'll turn it over to the stellar panel we have here, [ORGANIZATION] from [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], the director, and [ORGANIZATION], our equity and policy director. I think, PERSON3, you're going to walk us through? PERSON3's the primary presenter, but just as a framing of this, you mentioned the historic investments in housing and homelessness, and these resources are an essential part of our successful strategy moving forward."
06_09_2016,homelessness,"Thank you. And this plan couldn't have happened without our continued cooperation and with our partnering jurisdictions and the staff work of our equity policy director, [ORGANIZATION], who did our data analysis for the needs assessment, and [ORGANIZATION] team that worked on the homelessness sections here that are so important to [ORGANIZATION]. Thank you."
06_09_2016,homeless; homelessness; affordable housing,"And what's important to know is that this plan, when we met with the community and our stakeholders...  asks that we create, we identify what are the basic needs. And the basic needs from the community were that we needed affordable housing choice, that we need basic services and homeless prevention and intervention, and community economic development. And the goals that we recommended fall right in line with those needs, that we need to increase affordable housing choices, that we need to reduce homelessness, increase stability for all residents, and improve our infrastructure and facilities and economic opportunities."
06_09_2016,homelessness,"So what you will see in this [ORGANIZATION] plan is that we're looking at approximately $88 million over a [ORGANIZATION] period with these entitlement funds. The majority is going to new homeownership development, some of it to rehab and preservation, followed by homelessness prevention and economic development. And they will all follow into those three goals and needs that I outlined."
06_09_2016,affordable housing,"And then in terms of our CDBG funding, the majority of that is going towards housing redevelopment. Our home funding is going towards also to new affordable housing. And in [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON], they're using some of that money for tenant-based rental assistance."
06_09_2016,affordable housing,"And in our action plan, I'm just showing you what you've already decided through the budget, how they will be presented to [ORGANIZATION] in terms of these three main needs and goals. So first was to increase and preserve affordable housing choice. And the programs under preserving affordable housing choice include housing redevelopment, support of our community-based development organizations, and new affordable housing."
06_09_2016,affordable housing,"So on that slide, so you've got $2.8 million for new affordable housing. Can you give me a sense of how is that money allocated? Sure."
06_09_2016,affordable housing,"There are three goals, and it's the first that I'm presenting. Okay. But also in terms of investment of our entitlement dollars for this projected for [ORGANIZATION] period in [LOCATION], there's a larger investment in new affordable housing than in the other objectives."
06_09_2016,affordable housing,"New affordable housing could be multifamily rental, but we're talking about homeownership here or both? We're talking about both. Is there a change in the investment in affordable homeownership?"
06_09_2016,homelessness,"A second goal for our federal resources is reducing homelessness and increasing stability. And if we break out the resources, the federal resources that are going towards that particular objective,  We can see that we're using [ORGANIZATION] for emergency shelter and rapid rehousing. We're also investing in ORG1."
06_09_2016,homeless,"How much general fund does [ORGANIZATION] get? Well, at the present time, nearly all the general fund money is proposed to be transmitted through [ORGANIZATION] to the joint office because it's nearly all homeless support services. and I can give you a detailed breakdown."
07_05_2017,affordable housing,"There's a story of food as a solution that has created safe neighborhoods, economic independence and healthy connected communities. So [ORGANIZATION] is based in [ORGANIZATION] affordable housing neighborhoods and they are layers and layers to what we do. We grow food, cook food, sell food and share food as a means to build community resilience."
07_05_2017,affordable housing,"It's the only nonprofit grocery store in the city that actually authentically puts healthy food on a level playing field. [PERSON] came out of a [ORGANIZATION] community process in [ORGANIZATION], which is [PERSON]'s largest affordable housing neighborhood. Community leaders identified that the neighborhood needed a grocery store that was easy to get to, that was affordable, that carried culturally relevant and healthy options, that provided a [STREET] of employment for neighbors, and did not sell alcohol, tobacco, and lottery tickets."
07_05_2017,affordable housing,"But to put the human face on it,  When we talk about very poor people that cannot access affordable housing in our community, we're talking about people who make 30 percent or less of the area median income. And for a single person, that's $15,000 a year. And for a family of three, that's $20,000."
07_05_2017,affordable housing,"We'll go through the usual surplus property procedure that Commissioner [PERSON] pioneered. I suspect that...  there won't be any city bureaus or others that will be wanting to use it. It's in a low density area with very poor transit service, so in terms of affordable housing, it doesn't have all that much capacity."
07_05_2017,homeless,"They learned this in the Second World War. But I really would say that... There's nothing wrong with people like are homeless, living off the grid in a sleeping bag, having a small solar panel, power up their phone, their computer."
08_17_2016,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION], are you here? All right, let's move on and see if he comes later. 945, please.  Request of PERSON1 to address council regarding the new move the city made with the homeless to close one shelter."
08_17_2016,affordable housing,"Yes, one of the issues that I have is that  I like the direction of how [ORGANIZATION] is taking more responsibility toward the affordable housing issue, also by the affordable housing bond that is being proposed, the new riverfront shelter by Mr. [PERSON] that has gone into the lease mode at this time. And I always hesitate what the last director for [ORGANIZATION] did before,  on trying to acquire the post office by paying an outrageous price for that property in [ORGANIZATION] from [ORGANIZATION] and i questioned their judgment on that where in my opinion if commissioner [PERSON] was handling that transaction that outrageous price wouldn't have been at that number and we're starting to see a lot of other properties being purchased there was one over there that  Mr. [PERSON] and Mr. [PERSON] had an interest, came in with an offer."
08_17_2016,affordable housing,"And again, I want to see the direction that [ORGANIZATION] is going on the affordable housing bond.  and understand that we have to have leadership in those areas to make sure things are done properly. And I believe that Commissioner [PERSON] is able to do that. And I've lost all confidence in ORG1 on what they did on FAC0."
08_17_2016,homeless,"I think many of you may recall I'm not the biggest fan of everything that happens at [ORGANIZATION], but I know they do have a new executive director just coming on board, and I hope that –  her work will be able to give us solid numbers talking about jobs retained, jobs grown, people moving up from poverty, the real ideas behind urban renewal areas. And I know, even though we're highly critical of you at [ORGANIZATION], I know that that's also your concern is that, you know,  government should work to ensure justice, and justice includes maximizing economic opportunity for people at the bottom. People at the top can do so well that they can sometimes fund a 400-bed [INSTITUTION]."
08_17_2016,homeless,"And I hope this will go off without any nitwit lawsuits trying to –  forces in some neoliberalism idiocy where we're going to sue the [ORGANIZATION] so that the environmental services can extort the maximum possible amount of money towards the  towards rate payers when we try and help the homeless. I think that that's going to be another dismissed lawsuit like the poor judgment of ORG1 when they tried to sue the city saying, the mayor's not doing enough to help us suppress homeless people. So I'm glad this came off consent"
06_26_2019,homeless; houseless,"During social service facility closures, whether temporary, spontaneous, or permanent, homeless or houseless are forced to seek social services at other facilities. Yes. They need to ride the [PERSON] to get there."
06_26_2019,homeless,"Try met dragnets, homeless people looking for social services. Don't fund this. This is a trap."
09_19_2018,homeless,"You're good to go. So the main reason why I wanted to come here, actually, what made me come here is, so I live downtown [ORGANIZATION]. And I'm sure everyone here can agree that just going grocery shopping or going into [ORGANIZATION] businesses, they're surrounded by homeless people."
09_19_2018,homeless,"And these homeless people will be, I mean, waving around weapons or things made into weapons or just  being kind of a nuisance right outside of the door. And I've actually almost gotten hit with certain objects, and it's made me feel very uncomfortable. And they're American citizens."
09_19_2018,homelessness,"We worked in collaboration with [ORGANIZATION] from the beginning  [PERSON] helped us provide training for ORG2 and that has had some impact according to their testimony in the work that they do to end homelessness. We have also loaned our  information officer to ORG3 when they didn't have any [ORGANIZATION] at that time. [PERSON] worked closely with [ORGANIZATION] to provide  First of all, design the budget equity tool, but also use that to analyze the budget proposals from all bureaus."
09_19_2018,affordable housing,"There we go, public roadways. In the past and the future, [ORGANIZATION] has and will provide input to bureaus relating to improving building codes  advancing the concept of accessibility as a component of affordable housing, encouraging the implementation of ideas relating to visitability and universal design in the new housing projects, especially zero-step entry, and hopefully engaging with [PERSON], who seeks, quote, collaborating with partners for an equitable city, unquote. Second, working with other organizations now and in the future to improve life for everyone in [ORGANIZATION]."
09_19_2018,homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] reached out to the [ORGANIZATION] for advice on how to improve the museum's physical accessibility and to expand programs that increase ease of use for people with a wide range of various disabilities. ORG2's involvement also includes [ORGANIZATION] members currently and in the future assisting the museum on the design of FAC0. I personally believe that the [ORGANIZATION] should become involved with the problem of homelessness, considered by many people to be [ORGANIZATION]'s biggest challenge."
09_19_2018,homeless; houseless,"The homeless, houseless population is too often overlooked in terms of disability. The DATE0 GPE0 Point-in-Time Count notes that 72% of homeless, houseless people have disabling conditions. Third, [ORGANIZATION] continues to emphasize inclusion as a guiding principle."
09_19_2018,homeless,"And I do not like the [STREET] [ORGANIZATION] is using them, you know, targeting them as a...  as a homeless camp, let them have their encampment until you're willing to have this conversation, you know, what they want. Mr. [PERSON], thank you. Thank you, [PERSON]."
09_19_2018,homelessness,"She was there at the creation of this office. And it's true. what she said about mayors getting pulled in different directions, whether it's housing issues, whether it's homelessness issues, whether it's policing issues, whether it's infrastructure issues, whether it's economic prosperity issues, whether it's development issues, there are always issues that are front and center."
09_19_2018,housing insecurity,"As someone who has done civil rights and immigration legal work for [ORGANIZATION], both here and abroad and in [ORGANIZATION], I can personally attest to the overwhelming need and crisis that we have on our hands right now, and your vision for this funding goes beyond that. our immigrant community and is important for our entire [ORGANIZATION] community. We currently have a huge number of families who are experiencing food and housing insecurity because the breadwinners have been taken from their home."
09_19_2018,homelessness,"This, of course, is integral to our strategy around addressing chronic homelessness in the city of [ORGANIZATION]. This report lays out an aggressive and achievable path forward, including quantifying the total cost of meeting that goal, an assessment of the available resources, and the next steps for implementation. This report responds to [ORGANIZATION]'s request from [ORGANIZATION] to produce an actionable plan for meeting this goal."
09_19_2018,homeless,"And [ORGANIZATION], the [ORGANIZATION] Director, and they're going to provide a few basic comments. And, of course, we have [PERSON] here as well from ORG1. Good morning."
09_19_2018,homeless,"Good morning, and thank you so much for having us here, Mayor and Commissioners. I've had the great pleasure of working with [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] and all of the conveners to develop this report on creating 2,000 units of supportive housing. And first, I want to thank you all for giving us the opportunity to do this work."
09_19_2018,homelessness; affordable housing,"It's not often I thank people for giving us work to do, but this was really quite a pleasure, and it wouldn't have happened without the resolution that you all passed DATE0 or [LOCATION]. So thank you so much. Very quickly, at [ORGANIZATION] we believe that deeply affordable housing is the solution to homelessness and that supportive housing is the solution for a subset of people who need both housing and coordinated services to succeed in housing."
09_19_2018,homeless,"Mayor, thank you. My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I'm the Director of [ORGANIZATION]."
09_19_2018,homelessness,"I, too, thank you for giving us this task because it's such a critical work in our shared efforts to end homelessness. There is a robust section of this report that is about implementation. It is the next steps."
09_19_2018,homelessness,"Thank you. You [ORGANIZATION]? Well, I want to first thank [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION],  and all the resource and housing providers who contribute on a [ORGANIZATION] basis to housing and supporting some of our most vulnerable residents."
09_19_2018,housing crisis,"and that is that the report clearly identifies that a lack of tenant protections, especially around screening criteria, continues to be an obstacle for renters of all walks of life. The private housing market is too often failing us by rejecting applicants for minor issues on their records. A lack of regulations has allowed private profit to become more important than the public good, and the result is the housing crisis that we're in."
09_19_2018,homelessness,"And for about $60 a day, we can actually...  [STREET] someone in a deeply affordable home with the services they need to get their life back on track. I think the math speaks for itself. DATE0, we challenged ourselves and our partners to find a [STREET] to significantly increase supportive housing in our community because, as we've noted, it's the only strategy that's proven to end chronic homelessness."
09_19_2018,homeless,"We asked for a roadmap, and [PERSON] we're accepting your work product. I want to thank everyone who contributed along the [STREET], especially [ORGANIZATION], and [ORGANIZATION], and [PERSON], and the team at [ORGANIZATION], and our interim director and our friends at ORG2 for their extraordinary work. And I want to highlight again something we heard [ORGANIZATION], that this work didn't start then or [PERSON]."
09_19_2018,affordable housing,"The three developments in front of us [ORGANIZATION] create affordable housing through the multiple unit limited tax exemption or multi program. These developments join the other 36 private sector projects in the inclusionary housing permit approval pipeline, making a minimum of 319 units affordable in otherwise market rate developments. Here [ORGANIZATION] to walk us through these developments is"
09_19_2018,affordable housing,"Thank you, Mr. [PERSON]. And just to let you know, that's the same direction we've gotten from the mayor, which is partially why I was able to answer your question with some specificity about public hearings, because it is something that we're looking at seeing if there's a [STREET] that we can speed it up. On the other hand, we don't do a very good job of telling people what we are doing about affordable housing."
09_07_2016,affordable housing,"I want to make it very clear that my position is that it's okay to proceed with foreclosures, remain impartial, set up the same system as [ORGANIZATION] where they have  Ordinance 275, 275, Chapter 7, where all the money is funded into a fund for affordable housing. And I recommend that you fund all the money into the [ORGANIZATION] fund for affordable housing. Then I don't have an issue with foreclosures."
09_07_2016,homeless,"Also, I read that [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] have taken a trip to the [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] area  center, what are you going to call it, where they deal with homeless people in [ORGANIZATION]. I didn't know that either, and it makes me feel good because I actually have given money to [ORGANIZATION] campaign. Yeah, I give $50 to a millionaire."
09_07_2016,homeless,I belong to [ORGANIZATION] on and off. [PERSON] needs FAC0 because they intend to do sweeps and they will not allow homeless people at the [INSTITUTION] to ask construction workers for money.
09_07_2016,homeless,They will not allow people – they want it to look like a Swiss village where you see the [INSTITUTION]. There won't be any people camping around the [INSTITUTION] because the homeless people use the bathroom. Even I have.
09_07_2016,homeless,that's not an area to have homeless people hanging around begging for money. They should do it at FAC0. Thank you.
09_07_2016,homeless,"And you also have no problem with falsifying charges against them. And I'm still waiting for the surveillance footage of my arrest here at [ORGANIZATION].  which you guys still won't give my lawyer for some reason. And also, you know, you have these homeless sweeps going on, and you're blocking the media from filming them."
09_07_2016,homeless,"And, I mean, so you orchestrate one of the biggest homeless sweeps. the city's ever seen, and then you just conveniently leave town, you know? And there's this city myth that you guys are actually helping the homeless, but the reality is is you aren't doing things, and you aren't putting those people into housing or anything."
09_07_2016,homelessness,"mr. PERSON0 hi  Okay, 996 passes the second reading. Let's take regular agenda item S1002, please. DATE0 extend the housing emergency declared by ordinance 1 8 7 3 7 1 to address increased homelessness identify council powers specify [LOCATION] duration continue efforts to address housing affordability and wave portions of the zoning code and standards an interest in adding the emergency clause to this is my second second  further discussion"
09_07_2016,homeless; affordable housing,"Well, I want to thank Mayor [PERSON] for bringing forward this extension of [ORGANIZATION], and it's very important as we continue to work on the issues of affordable housing and helping people who are homeless. So a very strong supporter. Aye."
09_07_2016,homeless,"I understand that that's going to be [ORGANIZATION]. And I hope that as time goes by, we can have some more conversations about how are we going to spend taxpayers' money wisely, how we're going to protect ratepayers from any suggestion of not paying for homeless services, because that's not allowed. And I know that all our council are very dedicated to doing that."
09_07_2016,homelessness,I appreciate people treating this emergency like an emergency. Because it is. And it's an emergency in both housing affordability and in homelessness.
09_07_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,There's no hiding that. To address both the availability of affordable housing and better access to services for people who are experiencing homelessness. I'm proud of this work.
09_07_2016,affordable housing,"Expand and clarify eligibility for [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] for affordable housing developments. Mr. [PERSON]. Thank you, Mayor."
09_07_2016,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] administers [ORGANIZATION], or [ORGANIZATION], exemption program  and the affordable housing construction excise tax exemptions in coordination with other city bureaus to promote the construction of affordable housing by offsetting some of the cost of new development to advance the city's affordable housing economic and equity goals. However, we have not had an explicit exemption for new shelters. These additions in this ordinance to the [ORGANIZATION] and construction excise tax exemption program  [LOCATION] that mass shelters are an allowable housing type to receive exemptions."
09_07_2016,affordable housing,"To receive the exemptions, shelters are obliged to provide services at no charge for a minimum of [ORGANIZATION]. The changes in this ordinance also allow for an ORG0 or construction excise tax exemption for services space and common areas in affordable housing developments. These changes are fully supported by [ORGANIZATION],  and will be important to the development of the new FAC0 shelter that [ORGANIZATION] will open [LOCATION]."
09_07_2016,homeless,"It will also allow nonprofit and faith communities an easier path forward toward helping provide shelters for members of our community. We have [ORGANIZATION] of [ORGANIZATION] here, and PERSON1 from [ORGANIZATION] to answer any further questions my colleagues may have. Good morning."
09_07_2016,homeless,I'm a program manager with [ORGANIZATION] and the new [ORGANIZATION]. A home. [ORGANIZATION] is very supportive of this proposal.
09_07_2016,homeless,"But system development charges were a barrier, particularly for smaller-scale programs. [ORGANIZATION] worked closely with [PERSON] and the ORG2 staff on proposed language, and it's consistent with our community's investment priorities. So we look forward to working with [PERSON] in the future and –  and to these changes."
09_07_2016,homeless,"If we open up [ORGANIZATION] and only put 100 people in there and have an additional 400 beds, that's very beneficial to you in the event we do have a natural disaster that we need to relocate people. And I want you to start really focusing on this to understand the importance of these developments taking [STREET]. and maybe even focus on getting some type of federal funding for these developments to work together as a mass shelter for the homeless, and also in the event of a serious disaster."
09_07_2016,homeless,"It's not just for the homeless, really. It's also for people that might be displaced out of their homes due to a disaster. And these developers stepping up right now, it's very important to understand that, of the capacity of these mass shelters and the importance not just for the homeless  but for all the city itself."
09_07_2016,homeless,"And this is a new direction we're seeing now, and I think it's the most important direction to look at in working from your position and working from housing to make sure these projects do go forward and understand it's just not about the homeless. It's about having that additional space in the event we have a true emergency out there to truly locate them into these facilities. And I think that's a very important issue at this time."
06_10_2020,affordable housing,"In the wake of the murders of [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION], [LOCATION], PERSON3, and so many Black people before them, I'm asking you to withdraw $50 million from the [ORGANIZATION] budget and reallocate those resources to trauma-informed crisis intervention, affordable housing, and other community resources that will benefit public safety for all. The proposed $7 million reduction to the original budget still increases the ORG1 budget over [ORGANIZATION] and thus increases the policing of black Portlanders and other marginalized members of our community. When I worked for [ORGANIZATION], I filed countless reports illuminating disproportionate policing of black and brown community members."
06_10_2020,affordable housing,"Caller, if you will read our [TIME] time certain item 433. Okay.  amend planning and zoning code, the comprehensive plan map, and the zoning map to implement the expanding opportunities for affordable housing project. Thank you."
06_10_2020,affordable housing,"I'm with [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], who's also with [ORGANIZATION], is here with me. We're here to take the next steps towards the final vote on the expanding opportunities for affordable housing project. The project, as you recall, includes two items, some zoning code changes to allow conditional use institutions in residential zones to  add housing to their sites without having to revise their conditional use permit, as well as zoning map and comprehensive plan map amendments on a number of other sites, institutional sites where it would facilitate more specific opportunities."
06_10_2020,affordable housing,"On [ORGANIZATION], you held a public hearing and took testimony on this item. Some of the testimony suggested additional sites be considered for zoning changes, and there was also testimony expressing concern about several of the sites. You also discussed your own concerns about the project's actually result in regulated affordable housing."
06_10_2020,homeless; houseless,"and in what specific ways is the [ORGANIZATION] contract limiting these or other necessary spending reductions? Specific cuts have been demanded by community leaders, including defunding transit policy,  gun violence prevention teams, SROs, and more. Leaders have also recommended specific changes to the city's approaches for policing our homeless, our houseless community, our undocumented community members, protesters, and others which seem to also impact potential budget decisions."
06_10_2020,houseless,"Police do not prevent crime. They criminalize being black, being houseless, and being poor. Almost 30% of recorded instances of police use of force in [ORGANIZATION] are against Black people, who make up only 6% of the city's total population."
06_10_2020,houseless,"[ORGANIZATION] has done everything possible throughout its history to violently exclude, remove, and destroy Black people, and [ORGANIZATION] continue that history [ORGANIZATION]. We need justice for [ORGANIZATION], and for every Black person in this city killed, assaulted, and surveilled by the [INSTITUTION]. Black adults are, by the [STREET], the fastest-growing houseless demographic in [PERSON]."
06_10_2020,unhoused; houseless,"About 50% of the reported instances of [ORGANIZATION] police use of force are against houseless people. What if instead of criminalizing healthlessness, we genuinely work to ensure that nobody in society was forced into it? With the funds allocated to the police bureau and the proposed budget, we could provide safe housing to every unhoused person in [ORGANIZATION] many times over."
06_10_2020,homeless,"It's time to reappropriate public funds away from the police and towards making our community better. Towards schools, parks, housing, and programs meant to enrich our lives. Towards more substance abuse counselors, mental health, and homeless advocates."
06_10_2020,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION], which has been incredibly detrimental to the ORG1 community here. ORG2, which has also been incredibly destructive to so many young ORG1 members of this community.  and also the homeless outreach programs and engagement, which has not served its purpose in the [STREET] it should. I'm calling for these portions of the budget to be reallocated to reparations, to community outreach programs,  and community building programs, and especially to social services, which are so desperately underfunded in this city and are not able to provide as they need to for the very people that ORG3 harms."
06_10_2020,homelessness,"In the [ORGANIZATION] general fund guidance, it stated that Mayor [PERSON] is directing and challenging leaders and managers to take bold action beyond their bureau walls to find ways to deliver services better and more cost efficiently.  and more cost efficiently. However, there is $246.2 million for [ORGANIZATION], which is about a third of the general fund budget. When compared to other priority issue areas, homelessness at $46 million, $214.8 million in [ORGANIZATION], parks at $197.5 million, climate change and...  placement litigation, there is a significant discrepancy."
06_10_2020,homeless,"And I would just like to see more help out there for the people that are homeless and that need help instead of the police coming and not knowing exactly what to do. I do have a lot of concern when I hear people say defund the [INSTITUTION]. So I was just kind of looking it up on the web to get a better understanding of that, because most black people here are  with any type of record are not able to carry a weapon."
06_10_2020,homelessness,"Shift certain responsibilities and associated funding away from the police bureau and to agencies and community groups more equipped to deal with issues like homelessness, mental health crises, drug abuse, and school safety. Elevate and support staff, those within [ORGANIZATION] who are actively working to dismantle the institution of racism that exists within policing. Ban no-knock warrants and implement a zero-tolerance policy for police brutality and misconduct."
06_10_2020,affordable housing,"I demand that these funds be used to support the healing and growth of the Black community and are redistributed into mental health services, business loans, affordable housing, and education. Thank you. Thank you, [ORGANIZATION]."
06_10_2020,homeless,"As we've been going through this pandemic, it's been very obvious that [ORGANIZATION] is either inept or underfunded in a [STREET] that's able to properly care for the people who live outside [ORGANIZATION]. Over 50% of the people who were arrested [ORGANIZATION] were homeless. And I don't understand why our only response to public health and public safety is police."
06_10_2020,houseless,"This should be invested in addiction recovery and communities most impacted by the war on drugs. In [ORGANIZATION], half of the arrests are from the houseless community. We are criminalizing poverty and criminalizing addiction and mental health problems."
06_10_2020,homelessness,"when we are spending more money on housing and [ORGANIZATION], when we're spending more money on homelessness, it shows true values of how we are spending our values. [ORGANIZATION]'s majority of us demanded that we have to align our values and it's time for [ORGANIZATION] to suggest  to change the [STREET] we operate in [ORGANIZATION] and we have to meet the demands of [ORGANIZATION]ers. We will not stop until those demands are made."
06_10_2020,homeless,I was terrified. I've seen police officers throw tear gas canisters into a homeless camp without provocation. I'm horrified by what I've seen.
06_10_2020,homeless,"I'd like to address the issue of the urgent need of funding housing for a homeless population. These citizens are being traumatized by current events, and they need shelter now. I'm serving them in food pantries, feeding programs, and I do live in the downtown [ORGANIZATION] area."
06_10_2020,houseless,"A special thank you to you, Commissioner [PERSON], for your [ORGANIZATION] of work in policing reform. My name is [PERSON], and I go by PERSON2. I live in [ORGANIZATION], and I work in a community-based mental health and houseless services and public schools in the [ORGANIZATION] metro area."
06_10_2020,houseless,"I'm originally from [ORGANIZATION], a city that is a grotesque model of white supremacist policing. In my  In my time in [PERSON], I have seen many parallels as evidenced by the long list of Black lives taken by the police and the numerous people I have seen violently impacted by the disproportionate policing and criminalization of [ORGANIZATION], queer, [ORGANIZATION], and houseless individuals. Commissioner [PERSON], you spoke to incrementalism in your [ORGANIZATION] winning statement of this public hearing."
06_10_2020,housing crisis; houseless,"It's time to abolish the police entirely and allocate resources to the health and well-being of our marginalized communities who have been harmed by the brutality. Even before [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]'s housing crisis was catastrophic, and a large portion of the houseless population lives in my section of downtown. I'm surrounded by shelters, the sidewalks are lined with tents, and instead of addressing the issue in a constructive [STREET], the city has only worsened the crisis with cops."
06_10_2020,homeless,This is just the latest addition to the long list of infractions cops have committed against the community it pretends to protect. The police too frequently use higher level of force necessary on individuals suffering from actual perceived mental illness. They have a pattern of shooting mentally ill homeless people.
06_10_2020,homelessness,"And in [LOCATION], 52% of the arrests made in [ORGANIZATION] were of people experiencing homelessness, despite representing approximately 3% of the population. City council members need to take action because no amount of reforming or retraining will make officers less violent, less racist, or suddenly empathetic. The systems of policing and incarceration have no role in public health and safety."
06_10_2020,homelessness,"Um,  for the important public for the police bureau but yeah um long story short yeah let's i'd like i'd like to put a record that i'd like to take as much money away from the police officers as possible and put it back into the community specifically housing first i think we're going to lose a lot of the issues that we have um that surrounding homelessness surrounding crime and surrounding the perception of crime if we can just get people housed thank you i yield the rest of my time  Thank you."
06_10_2020,homeless,"We need justice and dignity for all, and we can start right now. I myself and my family have been racially profiled walking home from work,  driving, going to school, getting back from work by the police and was held against my will for long periods of time to confirm my identity as well as my immigrant status. Multiple times not just in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] but in GPE2 and [PERSON] and many other states.  defund the [ORGANIZATION] allocate funds to community-based models of safety support and prevention fund that 50 mil to immigration social work crisis staff that focus on de-escalation social workers women's shelters homeless shelters affordable health care planned parenthood rehab and reparations community outreach and many other more  that we can fund besides the police."
06_10_2020,homeless,"And with that said, I would like to go on to the budget. I think at least $50 million should be cut from our budget. And honestly, I think maybe 50% of the budget should be cut because to me, if 50% of their job is harassing homeless people, then 50% should be given to housing the homeless and mental health services."
06_10_2020,housing insecurity,"Second, I call for a minimum of $50 million to be reallocated towards the reestablishment of historically overpoliced communities by aiding against food and housing insecurity. And finally, I call for the immediate resignation of [ORGANIZATION] as police commissioner and mayor. His absence of leadership during these times has demonstrated his lack of ability and lack of compassion for our city and for our [ORGANIZATION] community."
06_10_2020,affordable housing,"We need to invest in the African American families by training leaders out of each family so that they can go back to their family with the tools and can help their families address this functional generational curses that have been passed down generation after generation. I am asking you to fund three very important things. Grassroot organizations that are created by African American leaders that live in our community, affordable housing, funding programs to educate our youth about the drugs and alcohol  they will experience when they grow up or be in the community."
06_10_2020,houseless,"55 of those are vacant right now. and the investments are in black youth development and the FAC0 response, and in making sure that houseless people have a participatory budget process to help them have the resources to help them be stable until we have housing that everyone can afford to live in. I thank you all, this is absolutely,  It's been just a beautiful thing to listen to all the passion and all the desires to do something different."
06_07_2017,houseless,"If we're going to talk about smart cities and technology and historically underserved communities,  [LOCATION] black people, [LOCATION] brown people, [LOCATION] Muslim people, [LOCATION] women, [LOCATION] disabled, [LOCATION] houseless. You absolutely have to talk about all aspects of the safety that you're speaking about in regards to those communities. You don't get to cherry pick which things you speak about in regards to safety for those communities."
06_07_2017,houseless,"But we don't have the money for that. You know, we're very, you know, again, I think you really should look at this as an equity issue and whether or not this is the best [STREET] for us to, you know, when you do public-private partnerships, it shouldn't be that the private partners get to have the most protection and decide who's going to get prosecuted. I'm pretty sure that if you look at who these four officers are ticketing and going after more often, it's probably houseless people in the downtown core, which is not equitable."
08_15_2018,homelessness,"I don't see Mr. [PERSON] here. Next individual. 849, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel regarding homelessness."
08_15_2018,affordable housing,"In other words, rather than being the last one in to talk about land banking or housing opportunities or commercial enterprises, we're actually leading that conversation  And as I have said, I've thrown down the marker that we will only support the transportation initiative provided that the anti-displacement strategies and the affordable housing and workforce housing strategies and the local commercial opportunities are discussed. as part of that overall project. And I'm very pleased with the partnership that's been developed there."
06_21_2018,homeless,"We've funded eight new grants [ORGANIZATION] with community organizations and leveraged over $2.9 million in matching resources. These grants are responsible to needs identified by the community and support organizations to use technology in addressing those issues. For example, [ORGANIZATION] grants are supporting ORG1 in [ORGANIZATION] and outside the frame to address the needs of their low-income and homeless youth."
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"And you can see the expanded resources here. And more importantly, what it does is it opens up a pot of resources for us to truly fulfill our affordable housing obligations. You see the $13 million increase there."
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"As I mentioned, the vision for [ORGANIZATION], if you go beyond the actual dollars that we're putting to work and what the city's outcomes are, you can see here the broader outcomes. When [ORGANIZATION] was created, when FAC0 was created, we talked about things like 10,000 jobs, housing units. Obviously, affordable housing units is part of that."
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"So it's tied to the assessed value of the projects that [ORGANIZATION] would bring online. In addition, there's an affordable housing option in [ORGANIZATION], and that option is highlighted in the purple square or rectangle, and we'll go into more detail on that in a moment. We also start a park partnership with the ORG1 in regards to where a park might be, size, location, and programming-wise."
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"We need that $210 million of assessed value to get the $35 million or the $24 million of [ORGANIZATION] that then allows us to do our investments. We're now going to focus on some of the details. In regards to FAC0 and the affordable housing approach, the [ORGANIZATION] housing goals for FAC0 included 479 units serving 0 to 60 percent MFI."
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"This RFP included a program requirement for a minimum of 200 affordable housing units serving 0 to 60% MFI, and of those units for 90 to serve 0 to 30% MFI. We have three proposals that were received for that RFP, and the selection committee and evaluation committee is currently reviewing those proposals. We also are including an affordable housing option in the development agreement with the [ORGANIZATION]."
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"That option will also include an escalation rate that's based on the CPI up until the time that option is executed. And we're projecting that that option would be executed in [ORGANIZATION]. So with [ORGANIZATION] currently underway and this project, those are two projects that could forward [ORGANIZATION]."
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"primarily with [ORGANIZATION], but also with [ORGANIZATION], ORG2, [PERSON], and other bureaus that may have a part in FAC0. One of the things we need to do is solve the stormwater solution for not only the FAC1 private development, but also for FAC2. and the park and affordable housing."
06_24_2015,affordable housing,I'd like to congratulate the parties for arriving in an agreement that provides for the continued development of FAC0 and with the [ORGANIZATION]'s and [ORGANIZATION]'s obligation to provide funding for the extension of FAC1  ultimately to provide one-[STREET] northbound traffic flow. The agreement appears to provide protections for each party involved. ORG2 is providing an option for ORG3 to purchase a lot during [ORGANIZATION] of development for affordable housing.
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"And as we've already heard, this is in addition to FAC0, which is now fully occupied, and to what is expected to be another affordable housing project at FAC1 on FAC2. So FAC3 really will be moving forward on its earlier commitments to affordable housing, which I think is very positive. I applaud the potential district energy system which [ORGANIZATION] may develop and to which ORG1 buildings may ultimately connect for its environmental impact possibilities."
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"What I've witnessed and watched happen is that this diversity in the neighborhood, whether you're a luxury condo homeowner or you're an employee at [ORGANIZATION], I mean, this helps [STREET] the retail in the neighborhood. So as [ORGANIZATION] continues to move forward, I'm a big fan of continuing this diversity in the neighborhood, whether it's affordable housing, whether it's [ORGANIZATION] employment, whether it's more market rate housing, which I'm always a fan of. But I think that diversity really leads to a complete neighborhood, and I think really –  The conversation in [LOCATION] is just another great neighborhood in the city of [ORGANIZATION], and I think the retailers play a big piece of that, and I think the clientele of the retailers help [STREET] that forward."
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"The vision at the outset was a community that includes an equitable share of affordable housing, affordable to households with lower incomes, particularly, as was pointed out, at certain income levels like 60% of median and below and 30% of median and below. Land in the [ORGANIZATION] area is appreciating continually, given the ongoing investments in the area. And so the city's acquisition of land for the purpose of affordable housing is the right strategy."
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"And so it's very notable that the family is agreeing to sell property to the city expressly for the purpose of affordable housing. It demonstrates their long-held commitment to promoting inclusion in the neighborhood. And it could serve as a model across the city, too, of how to do things differently."
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"the purchase price for example remains to be determined but as we saw there's a clear process outlined in the agreement of how that will be done so i think that also is a good thing last thing i would say is approval [ORGANIZATION] does not complete the work not only on the development side but on the affordable housing goals it is true that combined with parcel 3 and this new opportunity  from the [ORGANIZATION] family, we can likely meet the goals that were set out and shown on the slides earlier. It's important to remember that those goals, when they were set, were associated with a number of 3,000 total housing units in the neighborhood, that that was sort of the vision and that that goal was attached to kind of that first phase of 3,000 housing units. We're just about at that point, I believe, we're about to cross that milestone."
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"So there still is a conversation that needs to happen to clarify what goals would we have in the future as the neighborhood grows further. So there is work to be done still on affordable housing even beyond this, but it's true that with this additional opportunity, we have come a long [STREET] in [ORGANIZATION]. So thank you very much."
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"We believe [ORGANIZATION] should focus on catalyzing private sector job growth, and this agreement is in effort to do that. We applaud the earlier extension and expansion of [ORGANIZATION], as it has largely made possible the city's investment and affordable housing components of this agreement. This public-private partnership between the city, [ORGANIZATION], and ORG2 is mutually beneficial and reaffirms the party's longstanding commitment to economic development in [LOCATION]."
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"The agreement will accelerate development and result in more jobs and public benefits, ranging from transportation to open space to affordable housing. This prime waterfront property is the largest available site left in the central city and is ripe for development, located near new transit lines and  and one of the region's largest employers, [ORGANIZATION]. Seizing these opportunities are key to promoting the innovation quadrant, where major projects have already led to transformative investments by local universities, developers, and employers."
06_24_2015,affordable housing,I like the development agreement. I do want to see it finalized. A couple concerns I guess I have on the affordable housing parcel.
06_24_2015,homeless; affordable housing,"Where's Commissioner [PERSON] when I go to talk? We actually had an affordable housing memorial he participated in here, I'm going to guess, about [ORGANIZATION]. And what we calculated was pretty much the [TIME] [STREET] count of homeless people was almost exactly the same as the affordable housing, which had disappeared to the south waterfront."
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"Ah.  did not build the promised affordable housing. Now that the property values have escalated because of all the city's funding and the development and putting in the roads and the streetcar, now we're thinking about how much we're going to spend in future prices to put in a park? No."
06_24_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"I think [PERSON] has plenty of money to build that park. And I think that $5 million will go a long ways to addressing the housing crisis that we have. Let me repeat myself, because we never built the promised affordable housing when we developed that whole area and changed it from the toxic waste site that it was  We have remediated that as a society."
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"Well, they develop that aren't ideal. And so I support the recommendations that they'll they'll bring forward and won't address them here. But I did want to say thank you for stopping the process and asking [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] to kind of go back to the table and look at how they could address affordable housing and the development agreement."
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"I know doing that at [ORGANIZATION] doesn't put [ORGANIZATION] in the greatest position of leverage, and I think that what they have proposed is a long ways from where we were just [LOCATION]. So it is exciting to see this is a historic development agreement, both as it relates to the residential development, but just the development and economic development that will come from development of that property. One of the things I did want to address is, as a number of folks have said already, this agreement itself isn't the only thing that needs to happen in the district as it relates to affordable housing."
06_24_2015,affordable housing,So these were the discussions that we were having before we even approved the urban renewal district. And I do think right now we have one affordable housing project. I would argue that everything else is a high-end enclave.
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"We do have – [ORGANIZATION] does own significant land in the district, and I'd ask that the city –  work with [ORGANIZATION] to find how we can commit some of that land for residential development, affordable housing, and workforce housing. [ORGANIZATION] still owes ORG1 $2 million. The value of that probably is about $2.4, $2.5 million looking at inflation, not taking into account opportunity costs."
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"And we know from a survey in [ORGANIZATION] that 88 percent at that time, 88 percent of the employees at [ORGANIZATION] made less than $50,000. One-third of the employees at [ORGANIZATION] made less than $20,000. So I really want to see that we're having a conversation about how both affordable housing and housing at 80% median income really does support [ORGANIZATION] and the work they're doing and our economic investment in the district."
06_24_2015,affordable housing,The DA places deadlines on the city's acquisition and development of the park and the affordable housing parcels. [ORGANIZATION] will be needed to finance those projects. The availability of [ORGANIZATION] depends entirely on when [ORGANIZATION] develops its properties.
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"The [ORGANIZATION] money kicks us to 60, and I'm on your side, and I want more housing, and I want to make sure we hit our targets. I just want to be clear, the assumptions around money for affordable housing, you get to the 47, which is the amount we have for the first two projects,  is exclusive of the ORG1 agreement. Okay."
06_24_2015,affordable housing,It's not advisable to tie the city's right to buy and develop these sites to a time frame over which the city has no control. The housing and the park are too important to the district to risk losing them due to the unpredictable timing of real estate development. The [ORGANIZATION] recognizes the efforts [PERSON] made to strengthen the affordable housing provisions.
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"Keep in mind that in [ORGANIZATION], the [ORGANIZATION] paid $5 million for FAC0. This DA commits only $5 million in [ORGANIZATION] for acquisition. Instead, a timeline and pricing formula similar to that for the affordable housing site should be applied."
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"If development does not occur, [ORGANIZATION] fails to materialize, and the city does not meet the deadlines for acquiring the affordable housing and park properties, what are the consequences? We read the DA to say that the city will lose the right to acquire these properties if it does not purchase them by the deadlines set forth in the agreement. In the event of environmental contamination or tidal complications, the agreement caps [ORGANIZATION]'s responsibility for curative measures at $250,000."
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"There are significant exposures and risks that need to be addressed before this agreement is executed, and we encourage you to attend to them. And also, in the time I have left, I want to second [ORGANIZATION] comments about [ORGANIZATION]. The [ORGANIZATION] has been saying that over and over again, that [ORGANIZATION] needs to step up and provide a site for an affordable housing project."
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"So could staff come back up, please, [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON], for any other questions from council? [ORGANIZATION], the [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] raises a question, I think a very important question about under what circumstances could we effectively lose the option to purchase the dirt in the ORG1 development for affordable housing. Now, we've got timelines here, and we know from your presentation we've got resources, [ORGANIZATION] resources that are developed exclusive  independent from the ORG2 development agreement, but under what circumstance could the city lose its option to purchase that shirt?"
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"So the option that will be negotiated includes a timeline for the acquisition. We outlined projected dates for when that would occur. And those dates are outlined in the development agreement as well, specifically requiring that the purchase option for the affordable housing needs to be executed by [ORGANIZATION]."
06_24_2015,affordable housing,correct and um how much uh tiff do you anticipate will be available for the just for the acquisition of this uh land um independent of whether mr [ORGANIZATION] moves forward with his development as of [ORGANIZATION] independent of the development agreement i mean without without without any new tiff being generated as a as a result of his development What's the what you're going to spend 19 million in block three? What are the available resources for affordable housing as of [ORGANIZATION]?
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"And as is her style, she got directly involved in the sort of personal diplomacy to satisfy her concerns. Okay. DATE0, we were looking at a district before the mayor's proposal to do reset on urban renewal generally that was projected to have about $7 million for affordable housing."
06_24_2015,affordable housing,And I  you know and without the [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]'s commitment to expand to south waterfront uh you know another piece of the puzzle uh would not have happened so met the major piece ORG2 [ORGANIZATION]'s major commitment there and really this is the last major piece and i'm really excited about both the opportunity to allow us to achieve our affordable housing goals  in the [LOCATION] waterfront and I think this does protect the public's interest by Providing is setting a price for the purchase of the parcel of land in advance and I believe that we will based on the wildly successful Development that we anticipate will happen there that we will have adequate resources when those resources are needed to add these additional units of affordable housing and more
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"Thank you, Mayor. Mr. [PERSON], I appreciate you bringing that. The other concern that was pending after the hearing was about the level of affordable housing requirements."
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] did indicate on the record during the testimony that she is committed to providing some compensation towards affordable housing. I want to state on the record that this does not... This is under the current rules, and this doesn't set a precedent for any future developments that we would actually require to provide a definite level of affordable housing subsidy if that's the [STREET] the council chooses to go."
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"I just want to say that  I appreciate Commissioner [PERSON]'s points, as well as Commissioner [PERSON]'s, and to the extent [ORGANIZATION] will be engaged in this second PDA on this,  design issues and the use of the affordable housing bonus, we will continue to actively participate. And I'm very pleased that [ORGANIZATION] has chosen to use this affordable housing bonus to obtain the additional height. And she committed to me that this would be at least a $500,000 payment into our housing investment fund."
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"So it's a great move, and I look forward. And I really appreciate [ORGANIZATION] stepping up and utilizing the affordable housing bonus to obtain the additional height they need for this building. Bye."
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"PERSON0? Aye. PERSON1? It's good to be working with our partner, [PERSON], a known advocate for affordable housing and for doing the right thing so that we have confidence in passing this [ORGANIZATION] amendment that the right thing is going to happen there."
06_24_2015,homeless,"Authorize a grant to [ORGANIZATION] in an amount not to exceed $1,716,410 for the provision of treatment readiness services, traditional housing, and follow-up retention support services to chemically dependent homeless adult chronic arrestees. Good [TIME]. Good [TIME], Mayor."
06_24_2015,homeless,"I don't know whether this is part of the discussion. A couple of times I've been on the FAC0 going to the convention center and have seen our officers working with their inspectors in a fairly aggressive manner.  particularly against people who appear to be homeless and that was not my understanding of what transit police were doing i wasn't aware that you were part of the fair enforcement team parents enforcement is very uh important uh to the transit uh to trimet and we do partner up they handle the fair inspecting and we handle uh looking at criminal histories and um  exclusions and warrants and we do those for a number of reasons. It is working the system itself, securing and making people feel safe and taking people that have warrants off the system and it's also terrorism."
06_24_2015,homeless,"And I believe that climate change is our generation's challenge. What we do [ORGANIZATION] to fight climate change will determine the health of the community that our children will inherit [LOCATION]. But our actions will also send a clear message to communities of color, to the homeless, and to seniors who will be disproportionately affected by climate change, that we are committed to making our community more equitable."
06_24_2015,homeless,"Mosquitoes can carry deadly diseases like the [LOCATION] virus, which we are already starting to see in [ORGANIZATION]. As the Pope has said, the elderly, the homeless, and the communities of color will be most impacted by climate change. They may live in substandard housing conditions that already have mold and mildew."
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"noting the commitment to equity, ensuring measures to address the underlying social and economic issues in our region. It prioritizes investments that create jobs and benefits low-income populations.  and communities of color. And implementing these equity goals will mean actively involving diverse communities in the development of climate programs, and it means establishing goals for every resident to have access to things like affordable housing and transportation, parks, schools, and more."
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"Update the floor area ratio bonus and transfer provisions of [ORGANIZATION] for the central city to prioritize affordable housing development and other targeted public benefits. Commissioner [PERSON]. Thank you, Mr. [PERSON] and members of the council."
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"DATE0, the city council had its first hearing on revising the floor area bonus and transfer system to prioritize affordable housing. The council charged [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] to conduct an economic analysis and to develop recommendations for an incentive zoning bonus for affordable housing in the central city. This proposal doesn't reprioritize how we use taxpayer funds."
07_09_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"In fact, it doesn't use any taxpayer funds at all. It expands the pie of dollars available for affordable housing development and  by bringing to the table the development community to help be part of the solution to the affordable housing crisis. Floor area bonuses, also known as density bonuses, are provided to developers in exchange for the developers providing a community benefit."
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"What we cannot require, however, is affordable housing. State law prevents us from doing that. It is past time to streamline our bonus system to prioritize for the creation of affordable housing."
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"In fact, there was a [ORGANIZATION] study that pointed out how many of our bonuses are really not in keeping or haven't been used or not keeping with current policy priorities of the city. This proposal before us DATE1 is crafted to grow the supply of affordable housing. It creates an on-site building option for developers to add affordable housing in future developments for Portlanders who may work in the central city, but housing near their work is currently unaffordable to them."
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"a household that makes between 60 and 80 percent of the median family income is not a wealthy household it may be a household with two food service workers a single parent working as a bus driver with two kids or an entry-level teacher our state of the housing report which we brought to council [ORGANIZATION] has shown that the central city and many other [ORGANIZATION] neighborhoods are unaffordable to these families it also clearly shows  just how unaffordable our city in general is to many lower income families. So let me be clear. This proposal will also add substantial housing stock for households in the lower incomes from 0% to 60% of median family income by providing an option for developers to pay into an affordable housing fund, which is limited to investing in 0% to 60% of median family income housing."
07_09_2015,homelessness,"So this fund will aid the city in its goal to create more housing for more families who are experiencing homelessness and other households such as senior citizens who are relying entirely on [ORGANIZATION] for their income. And as always, ORG1 continues its deep commitment to equity and how it invests these funds. So before I turn the presentation over to PERSON0 of ORG2, [PERSON], and our economic consultant, PERSON2, I'd like to make a small amendment to the resolution in terms of the timeline."
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"And the proposal we came up with has sort of five key elements. On the bonus end, we're proposing a bonus for affordable housing that's either built on site or we want to have an option where a payment into an affordable housing fund is an additional [STREET] to earn the bonus. Secondly, the strata of affordability that we focused and modeled on is 80% of median family income units."
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"So we can do that as we develop the specifics of the proposal by calibrating the value of those two bonuses a little differently. Okay. Four is that we want to have fewer bonus options, fewer than the 18 now that we have, so that we can make the affordable housing bonus a greater priority."
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"And also, to the extent that we include other bonuses in the final package, we're going to try to calibrate them in terms of their value to the affordable housing bonus so that the bonus –  We're getting the similar valuation or similar amounts of public benefit if you choose one of the other options, but the idea is to try to make the affordable housing bonus the most attractive because of the documented need for affordable housing in general and in the central city. The one exception, there's a couple of exceptions to this just to mention that in [ORGANIZATION],  In some sub-districts, we've got these bonuses that were really designed to be part of the development package because in [ORGANIZATION] we needed to deliver, for instance, waterfront improvements in the FAC0. So there's a bonus in [ORGANIZATION] for additional FAC0 properties, and there's a transfer provisions in [ORGANIZATION] as well."
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"So as we do this research, we're going to look at those in particular ones and see if there's logic or reasons that maybe they should be continued. And we're also going to say if they're continued, how do we calibrate them to work in conjunction with an affordable housing bonus. And so, and finally, there are limits in the central city now."
07_09_2015,affordable housing,It had an FAR of four to one and we were able to get to six to one using the existing residential bonus. So that's what the column all the [STREET] to the left represents. And then we looked at two cases adding an affordable housing requirement to getting the additional density.
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"They must be calibrated to the market, and then they must pencil out. Because if they don't pencil out, we're just going to create a strong incentive for people to jump to some other incentive, other bonus that doesn't provide the same level of public benefit, and we're undercutting what we're trying to do here with the affordable housing bonus. Is that a fair comment?"
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"Okay, not yet. Following up, looking at the resolution, it says support historic preservation through the [ORGANIZATION] transfer and development of publicly owned private space through transfer provisions. So essentially this resolution is saying that affordable housing will be the only bonus that's available?  Does it say that explicitly?"
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"It says based on our study, our recommendation for affordable housing is a bonus and our recommendation for historic preservation and open space is a transfer. And I believe our study didn't reach a conclusion about which or how many of those other bonuses you get rid of. But what it did conclude is two things."
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"One is we want to make affordable housing the priority, just given the state that we're in, in terms of housing prices and availability. And the second is we want to calibrate whatever else the city council thinks is valuable enough to put in a central city bonus so that it's in the same ballpark and comparable competitive with the affordable housing bonus. So the [STREET] that it's written, it doesn't actually say that in my opinion."
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"When we're done with testimony, I'd like to hear what the outreach has been and who's been involved in the discussions. Just for the record, the assignment to [ORGANIZATION] on this issue was not to come back with a proposal to eliminate the other bonuses. It was to come up with a proposal that would create incentives for the affordable housing."
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"I also sit on [ORGANIZATION] of the city and I'm a member of [ORGANIZATION]. I want to thank you for your opportunity to have me come and speak in support of this ordinance [ORGANIZATION]. As you know, ORG2 and our partners are advocating for multiple tools and policies to help meet the affordable housing needs in our city and across the state."
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"In light of the city's recent state of housing report and [ORGANIZATION]'s new fair housing requirements that came out [ORGANIZATION],  There's no doubt that this is a significant issue here in the city and that the federal government is going to be watching carefully going forward on what efforts we're making in order to permanently further fair housing and make sure that there's an adequate supply of affordable housing in all of [ORGANIZATION]'s high opportunity areas. Certainly the central city is one of those key high opportunity areas and this is a great first step and the city asserting itself to meet that requirement. We know that there's no single tool or solution that will address the entire shortfall of homes and the ranges of needs in our community."
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"We need to pursue multiple tools and strategies at all levels of government and across all sectors. To take just one example, [ORGANIZATION], along with 95 other organizations, are working within ORG1 to create a long-term, very large, sustainable revenue source to help fund affordable housing. We see this ordinance as a great complement to that effort."
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"This proposal, while it's not a complete solution, is a critical step forward. Redesigning and updating the central city bonus system to prioritize affordable housing is absolutely the right thing to do, and we applaud Commissioner [PERSON] for bringing this proposal forward. In [ORGANIZATION]'s market, beneficial amenities like bike racks and eco-roofs have become common practice."
07_09_2015,affordable housing,Because it helps us capture the value of density and use that value to address our growing need for affordable housing. I think we all recognize that need. And I think we know that the greatest need citywide is for housing affordable to households at 0 to 60% [ORGANIZATION].
07_09_2015,affordable housing,It's great that there's also a proposed payment in lieu option. It gives developers an option to pay into a fund that allows us to increase resources for 0% to 60% housing citywide. We desperately need more affordable housing and targeting the value created by FAR bonuses is a perfect [STREET] to generate these resources.
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"I'll be brief. I think, as you know, [ORGANIZATION] provides a portfolio of affordable housing, and we also provide...  rent assistance to thousands of families in our community to help them pay their rent. And the ability of the rent assistance that we have available [ORGANIZATION] is not enough to help people afford to live in a lot of areas of the central city."
07_09_2015,affordable housing,PERSON0 Thank you. [ORGANIZATION] urges council to support Commissioner [PERSON]'s resolution prioritizing affordable housing development in the city's FAR bonus and transfer provisions.
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"Instead, benefits incentivized through this FAR bonus and transfer provision must prioritize one of our city's most pressing issues, affordable housing. Without stable affordable housing, our families may not see these benefits of public parks, open spaces or bike racks. The FAR bonus and transfer provisions are just one tool of many required to meet the housing needs of our communities."
07_09_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,No one tool will be the solution to the city's affordable housing crisis. Incentive zoning practices that support affordable housing development or in lieu fund by the private market allow developers to be part of the solution. Our city needs to capture the value of density and elevate affordable housing as a primary community benefit in this mechanism.
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"We also see, as many have reiterated, that  We have a need for housing regardless, and we need more units. And to prioritize and capture some of those within the 60% to 80% leaves a lot more room for public investment into the 0% to 60%. We see that by incentivizing the private market to develop and include affordable housing  we can use additional funds for zero to 60."
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"Mm-hmm. So again, I'm going to have to go back that it's still fewer households that we're going to be able to house. It's fewer affordable housing units that will be built."
07_09_2015,homelessness,"60% of them are people of color between 60 and 80% of the median income. This is part of the continuum of housing support that we desperately need to allow people who are stable in their jobs to move into more stable housing to free up some of those critical units and target the public dollar that's so precious to the city and the county to the zero to 60% of median income that you're addressing, Commissioner [PERSON].  which we're all deeply committed to. That's the kind of crisis on the front lines of moving people out of homelessness."
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"Final point, this is also why we are deeply committed to the [ORGANIZATION] campaign along with those 95 other agencies you've heard about to win a dedicated source of revenue to fund affordable housing locally. And we're here and we're gonna rely on your support urgently for that."
07_09_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"and our coalition is in support of Commissioner [PERSON]'s bold resolution for incentive housing or zoning. As we approach this next generation of development through an equity lens, we must really ask ourselves, development for whom and equity for whom? Given the acknowledged and expanding post-recovering housing crisis, disparately impacting [ORGANIZATION]'s protected class population, specifically African Americans and Native Americans, and our local jurisdictional and state duty to affirmatively further fair housing, there's an urgent need to prioritize and direct this public benefit to affordable housing."
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"In [ORGANIZATION] we've experienced highs and lows. The lows being the persistence of the bans on inclusionary zoning and rent control, which limit the tools at hand to strengthen tenant protections and provide affordable housing. The highs reflected in [ORGANIZATION]'s rulings on disparate impact and [ORGANIZATION], or Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing."
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"In light of the latter, we must remember that while prioritizing affordable housing is important, prioritizing the siting of affordable housing in areas of high opportunity is essential. The [ORGANIZATION] mandate sets a path for government to intentionally integrate low-income and protected class communities into areas of affluence and opportunity rather than continuing to suburbanize and concentrate poverty. One of the goals of the Fair Housing Act is to reduce segregation."
07_09_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"In thinking about public-private partnerships and affordable housing, it's important to remember that [ORGANIZATION]'s duty to [ORGANIZATION] reads,  Although the grantee's [ORGANIZATION] obligation arises in connection with the receipt of federal funding, its [ORGANIZATION] obligation is not restricted to the design and operation of [ORGANIZATION]-funded programs at the state or local level. The [ORGANIZATION] obligation extends to all housing and housing-related activities in the grantee's jurisdictional area, whether publicly or privately funded. Thank you for considering this important first step in responding to our region's housing crisis."
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] has a long history of supporting affordable housing. In fact, I think the very first time I testified before you for this commission was in favor of the [ORGANIZATION] set asides. And we're generally supportive of Commissioner [PERSON]'s prioritizing of bonuses and transfers for affordable housing here."
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"We therefore urge that any proposed affordable housing bonus program apply to households up to 100% MFI. We don't feel it necessary to eliminate many of the current bonus and transfer options to achieve the city's affordable housing goals. The current bonus and transfer system supports the city's goals for density, encourages amenities that support other city goals, and allows for greater architectural creativity."
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"Instead of removing bonus options such as those for bike storage facilities that are working, the city should explore mechanisms to incent and make more attractive a new affordable housing bonus. For example, the three to one cap on bonus FAR that can be used on a single site could be raised for affordable housing. If this additional entitlement were allowed, it would make this affordable housing bonus attractive to developers and [STREET] its use even among the other bonus options."
07_09_2015,affordable housing,You control most of the land. And the thing about it is that what I see here is that I like that affordable housing fund. I want to have a more understanding on kind of what your plans are when money goes into the fund.
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"I think we all recognize that access to good jobs, transportation options, transportation  strong schools are the building blocks for family success without affordable housing in our most amenity-rich areas of the city we are in jeopardy of becoming a city that does not represent the values that [ORGANIZATION]ers share [ORGANIZATION] is missing a major tool in our toolbox the best practice that many cities already employ to develop affordable housing and that is the incentive zoning program the time is now to develop such a program And I would like to acknowledge and thank PERSON0 and [ORGANIZATION] for their hard work on this proposal.  from planning and sustainability [ORGANIZATION] sincere."
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"And as I said at the outset, I tend to be impatient on these things, but I feel comforting in knowing that all of us will be watching very closely the clock on getting these proposals up and running and truly providing more affordable housing in our community. And [PERSON] of my office  Of course. How could I forget [PERSON] for her help as well?"
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"So I personally would have said that we should have made it 0 to 60 because I think that would have made it much more likely that we would get more money into the affordable housing funds. But I am taking the advice of my constituents. And again, thank you, Commissioner [PERSON]."
07_09_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"Well, the affordable housing crisis in [ORGANIZATION] is really serious. And this proposal, Commissioner [PERSON], is a serious effort to use a complicated tool, our incentive program, to try to make a difference in that big complex issue. And [PERSON] may know this story."
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"Commissioner [PERSON], thanks for your energy and leadership on this. I really appreciate it. I think this was overdue.  and to focus on affordable housing and to maybe make this complicated machine a little simpler and maybe a little more effective in the bargain is good public policy."
07_09_2015,affordable housing,I'm the safety manager for [ORGANIZATION]. I think it is ironic we are speaking just after the council heard affordable housing issues that affect this city. I believe that these recommendations that [ORGANIZATION] has recommended to you will add additional cost to those projects and with constraints to the development of future high-density housing.
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"And like I said earlier, that equates to about one on the low end, 1.4 on the high end, 2.5 piles that we could install a day just from that [TIME]. So you have a rough sense of what the cost would be. I guess the second question I just want to ask, because, sir, you alluded to affordable housing."
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I live in [ORGANIZATION]. I live in affordable housing, so that came up."
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"I live in a building where there are a lot of older people, and people in affordable housing are very often vulnerable and don't really have any [STREET] to go. I earn my living by providing support services for people with disabilities, and I can't really offer much technical expertise beyond what people have already talked about. I did present...  I submitted a letter to [ORGANIZATION] and I'd just like to quote from it briefly about public health."
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"Will you read the next communication, please? Item 781, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel regarding affordable housing and job polarization crisis. Would you please come up?"
07_06_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,"For [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] has prohibited enacting mandatory exclusionary policies to create affordable housing. Only two states in the entire nation refused to provide this vital protection to their local citizens, [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON], which was passed on our state legislators during the last legislative session and recently signed into law by Governor [PERSON], was promoted as a solution to our affordable housing crisis."
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"The generally accepted formula for pricing affordable housing units is derived from applying 60% of the region's [ORGANIZATION] median wage,  Unfortunately, [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] definition of affordable housing is households with incomes equal to or higher than 80% of the median family income. According to [ORGANIZATION], the median family income for a family of four in [LOCATION] was approximately $74,000 in [ORGANIZATION]. Applying the minimum 80% coefficient factor against the region's median wage for a family of four is equivalent to just under $60,000."
07_06_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,"Our local affordable housing crisis will continue to exist as long as we allow retailers,  realtors and developers to use this higher threshold in the initial determination for pricing structures. This new exclusionary zoning law essentially discriminates against families making less than a minimum of almost $50,000 here [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION]. I'm sorry."
07_06_2016,homeless,okay great so that completes our communications and we're ready for our first uh time certain  good [TIME] sorry i'm late apologize for being late folks we just had a wonderful announcement this [TIME] between [ORGANIZATION] and the city of [PERSON] about opening another [ADDRESS] to stay so commissioner [PERSON] and everyone else are still doing great work and this was just one more sign of that
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"Unless [ORGANIZATION] is not. Okay, [ORGANIZATION]. Authorize nine subrecipient contracts totaling $2,598,579 for the provision of services in support of providing affordable housing."
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"Commissioner [PERSON]. Thank you, Mayor. This council has spent a lot of time in [ORGANIZATION] dealing with the capital side of affordable housing, approving sources of revenue that will help us to build more affordable housing for our residents."
07_06_2016,homeless; homelessness,"These services are critical to prevent families from losing their homes, helping communities of color purchase a home. to prevent further displacement, and to add to the safety net that supports low-income Portlanders who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. I don't know if you have any other words."
07_06_2016,homeless,"But in general, I think that you guys are talking about taking a bunch of zombie houses for the city. I think if that's going to be the case, and if you do actually take a bunch of these houses and the city becomes the owner, I think you should put them in the hands of [ORGANIZATION] or other community agencies, maybe some other community groups that actually are working to house people and not make a profit from,  off the whole poverty, pimp, crisis, capitalism role model that seems to be fueling [ORGANIZATION]. And I think that actually a lot of these housing issues would be taken care of if there wasn't so much profit motive to keep people homeless and to keep housing prices so high and all that."
07_06_2016,homeless; homelessness,"So basically, I don't think that the city should...  get ownership of these zombie houses that you call them. I think that they should actually be taken over by community organizations that actually aren't profit driven like [ORGANIZATION] and other people of that ilk that have turned poverty and homelessness into a major industry. I'd like to see people like ORG1 have more political power in this city, and I'd like to see you guys work with community organizations more than with these poverty-pimp corporations like ORG2, which also have patrols that go around and rustle the homeless [ORGANIZATION].  and call the police on the homeless and wage cultural war on the homeless."
07_06_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"So, you know, maybe you guys could put some money into some real community organizations, and if you're going to take a bunch of these houses, put them in the hands of the community and...  and stop throwing away so much money with all these poverty pimp organizations because it's obviously not working. Thanks very much. And homelessness won't be solved with affordable housing."
07_06_2016,homeless,"It's kind of like in downtown [ORGANIZATION]. I've been out there when I was homeless [ORGANIZATION]. I just don't, you know, since you have them, and then people are talking about using parks, why not just use these homes for right to dream, too, things like that."
07_06_2016,homeless,"Since there were complaints from the neighbors anyway, in the first [STREET], if there are complaints because homeless people are there, then there's not much change, but at least people can...  A lot of homeowners don't want intrusion. Certainly, if there's any kind of disturbances, then the police can get involved. Thank you."
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"I'll beat you to the punch. Okay. So next time [ORGANIZATION] proposes to put an affordable housing development in [ORGANIZATION] where there's a shortage of affordable units, we say to the folks who live there that they're not eligible for getting a parking permit because they came too late?"
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"First of all, the [ORGANIZATION], which was made up of transit advocates, people who were very opposed to parking garages and fought them bitterly, and people who were in favor of parking garages, unanimously endorsed this proposal to have both the shared parking and the parking minimums. The parking minimums were not established in our neighborhood at the time when they were established everywhere else. We had a lot of discussions about ways to improve the parking minimums, like eliminating the requirement for affordable housing,  or giving credits for bus passes or doing a variety of things."
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"As you weigh the alternatives, I would like to encourage you to consider the following key points. First,  First, there appears to be minimal correlation, if any, between the ratio of parking spaces provided to new units and [ORGANIZATION] rent. Affordable housing advocates are adamant that requiring parking increases the cost of housing."
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"However, actual pricing reflects a number of factors, and the practical reality is, as Commissioner [PERSON] just mentioned, that rents are about the same in northwest [ORGANIZATION] with or without parking. So the net economic benefit of pushing the parking burden to the streets primarily accrues to developers and not to those who are seeking affordable housing. You'll also note that Commissioner [PERSON], just [TIME], said that scarcity is what's driving rents, not cost."
07_06_2016,housing crisis,"I have two cars. My family has two cars anyway. And I am coming to speak out against the minimum parking requirements because we are in the midst of an unprecedented housing crisis, and I think that anything that increases the cost of housing and restricts the supply is something that should be avoided at all costs."
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"I just ran it by [ORGANIZATION], and he didn't tell me to leave the building. I'm going to get your reactions. what if we just said the parking minimums do not apply to affordable housing and if you're building a unit that that serves someone at 0 to 60 of medium family income which is where the greatest need is we said that um and and you have you enter into a regulatory agreement to keep you know that doesn't run afoul of rent control which we're preempted from doing right now tell me overturn that ban"
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"And the truth is lots of things add to the cost of housing, even for affordable housing. Especially for affordable housing, right? There's a lot of social costs built in."
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"But I'm trying to get philosophically what you would think about having a minimum but not applying it to affordable housing. I mean, certainly in principle, I don't oppose that at all. I think that's a great idea."
07_06_2016,housing crisis,"It's the additional units in that building which are going to help more than the lack of parking construction currently. This is a policy that should be reformed or repealed and not expanded, especially during a housing crisis. Unlike neighborhoods, in [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] has a toolbox full of parking management strategies at its disposal,  expanded permit zones, new meters, and after the recommended shared parking that we're asking for."
07_06_2016,housing crisis,"And pretty soon we should have better permit programs available as well. So I think there's much less risk right now in waiting to see how these more flexible and equitable policies play out and then adjust them to work better rather than applying a policy that might not really help very much and certainly will exacerbate the housing crisis. Um, so I think that's, that's really, um, I, there's some evidence that when you, when you talk about how we're going to get people out of their cars, um,  When you look at transit-oriented developments that have access to cheap parking, people don't give up their cars."
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"That's not how, you will shift the momentum if you give in to this request for bad policy to placate some neighbors. I,  One other point I want to touch on that's not really in the bike walk vote purview is this affordable housing issue. I think that there's a lot of focus placed on MFI, less than 60%, but there are really good reasons to want...  market rate housing to be affordable for the middle class."
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"And when you think about affordable housing, there are lots of different definitions, but I think you should absolutely be considering the people who will live in those 350 square foot apartments in the 120 unit building. I think those people should be given consideration, too, because we don't want just those people who are eligible and then the very wealthy to live in it. We want a spectrum of people."
07_06_2016,housing crisis,"You may wonder why does someone from [ORGANIZATION] care about what's going on in [LOCATION]? Well, a couple of things. One is that our whole city is in a housing crisis."
07_06_2016,housing crisis,"But in my neighborhood, I'm seeing my middle-income neighbors displaced or moving because of this housing crisis. So I wanted to just make that point because this policy will affect, in the short term, middle-income people more. but they are also being displaced and affected by this housing crisis."
07_06_2016,housing crisis,"So it represents, in essence, an indirect tax on the people who are most affected by the housing crisis. And in terms of equity, in terms of rationing, as has been discussed, I do want to also reiterate that if you look at census data in [ORGANIZATION], it is low-income people that tend to walk or use transit the most as their transportation mode. So I really want to strongly urge you to reject what I view as an unfair and unequal indirect tax on lower- and middle-income people."
07_06_2016,affordable housing,I do acknowledge that some of the exceptions in the framework are flawed and that the provision of affordable housing should be one of those exceptions. It is encouraging that the bike town program will have a strong presence in [ORGANIZATION]. A proposed crosstown bus route using [ORGANIZATION] should also be popular.
07_06_2016,affordable housing,I'm a supporter of affordable housing and sensible parking policy. I want both. I believe both goals are achievable and compatible with a simple policy change.
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"It's essentially the one that's been raised here as an alternative a couple times already [ORGANIZATION]. I believe it's oversimplified, if not inaccurate, to suggest that no parking equals lower rent. In fact, I think the absence of parking minimums simply opens the door to increased developer profits and does not assure more affordable housing in our tight housing market."
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"we need to make sure that the savings accrued by not building off-[STREET] parking are passed along to renters and the public simply not captured by developers who choose not to provide parking i believe there's a fairly straightforward solution permits should not be readily available to residents of new market rate developments that don't offer off-[STREET] parking it's a win-win-win developers who argue that their renters don't have cars are not required to provide parking  Renters who don't have cars aren't required to pay for it, and the public isn't burdened with the cost of increased demand for limited on-[STREET] parking. The market will pair renters who don't own cars with more affordable developments that don't offer parking. And I think, as [ORGANIZATION]'s raised, exceptions and incentives could be made for affordable housing units."
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"So I encourage the city council to evaluate and implement some type of plan like this, which will assure more affordable housing and not worsen the already difficult parking situation in northwest [ORGANIZATION]. In the meantime, regarding this timing issue, I do support parking minimums as a tourniquet. It's an imperfect but important tool that will help us balance parking supply and demand in the short term while we find a more comprehensive set of policies and programs that can be deployed in the longer term."
07_06_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,"The pathway, as you've heard from the experts here, that we should be taking, there are many, many other things that we should be requiring and trying out first before construction, especially when we're in the midst of an affordable housing crisis. I know that you all realize the urgency and the importance of dealing with that housing crisis. I thank you very much for your recent efforts in that area with the excise tax, referring the affordable housing bond to voters in [ORGANIZATION], and all the other actions you've taken in [LOCATION]."
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"So many of our places are market rate, but recently in [ORGANIZATION], we're approved for the affordable housing component. So that's what we're going to continue to do. I can't say that's the driving factor for parking,  because then what does that do as the previous gentleman said about the market rate units those are going to go up"
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"so if you don't get the cost will have to be recovered in some [STREET] we wrote a letter to uh [ORGANIZATION] and i'm just going to briefly go pat through this just to state um the parking requirements for the northwest district would have a serious negative impact on the future supply of the affordable housing if passed and housing as a whole the ability to create new affordable urban rental housings with escalating land costs  the increased permit costs, increased labor wages, increased material costs, and we just passed increased taxes for our construction. It's already a serious constraint, and yet we're asking for us to reduce the rent costs. I mean, the costs are the cost."
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"Some of the census tracts in the heart of [ORGANIZATION] have median incomes of just $28,000 or $35,000, which is far below the citywide average. In the neighbourhood as a whole, 76.3% of the housing units are occupied by renters, myself included. I live in a [ORGANIZATION] apartment building, which is typical of the market rate, but relatively affordable housing that can be found throughout the neighbourhood."
07_06_2016,housing crisis,"[ORGANIZATION] added parking minimums in much of the rest of the city in [LOCATION]. We're now [LOCATION] into that experiment, but according to ORG1 Director [PERSON], when she was speaking to ORG2 in [DATE], no analysis has been done by the city to date on what effect that's had in affordability. Since [PERSON], we've been in a declared housing crisis, and I don't think now is the right time to further experiment with adding parking minimums back into city code."
07_06_2016,housing crisis,Of course we need more housing. We're in a housing crisis. We need less cars.
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"Frankly, if something like that weren't built in our neighborhood, I'd be thrilled. I'd be happy if Commissioner [PERSON] or [PERSON] were able to build a whole bunch of affordable housing units with or without parking. And I agree with Commissioner [PERSON] that those units should be exempted from the minimum parking requirements."
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"I live at FAC0 and FAC1 in [ORGANIZATION]. I was listening to the folks who are advocating for the status quo, and I was thinking we all share the same goals, which are less cars, less pollution, more truly affordable housing, and more income diversity in the neighborhood. I am a proponent of a –  code revision to include the parking minimums in the [ORGANIZATION] District for all kinds of different reasons, but primarily so we are taken into the city."
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"On that issue of affordability, speaking to Commissioner [PERSON]'s point,  Our group is interested in affordable housing both in the subsidized category and in the low end of market, market rate category. And parking requirements, obligations affect both of those things. They make it more difficult to keep rents down in both of those categories of housing."
07_06_2016,affordable housing,These parking minimums are the only thing we can now use to keep the 30 pending units that are on these maps from overwhelming the existing parking out there. I don't want higher rents. I don't want to lose affordable housing.
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"And I certainly share the concerns about the impact on affordable housing, and that's something I want to try to understand better, too, in [ORGANIZATION]. Mayor, if I could just add a comment. The one thing that I'm clearer about at the end of this hearing is I don't think the affordable housing component is a top three factor in this discussion."
08_30_2017,houseless,Ending sweeps of houseless encampments. Stop prisoning addicts for being addicted. [PERSON] the racist [PERSON] gang database.
08_30_2017,affordable housing,I tried to confirm that on the fly. So I am worried about this conflict between affordable housing and  and our urban canopy. And there's many points in the report where that's called out.
08_30_2017,affordable housing,"Do you have anything additional to say about that? Because it certainly, if there is a conflict, and I don't think it is an either-or question, that's something that we need to resolve because chances are where we're building affordable housing, we have a deficient urban canopy to begin with. Any thoughts on that?"
08_30_2017,homeless,"Why are there so many homeless people out on the sidewalks? Obviously, we have in these numbers, too, that your bloated pensions and your salaries are part of the reason. But I'm not going after those, as I have stated."
09_14_2016,homeless,And let's please take item [DATE]. Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding our homeless citizens. Good morning.
09_14_2016,homeless,"So anyway, with regards to the homeless, we have a big problem. And these people, a lot of them, they need to be helped. And so...  I really encourage you in your position when you make decisions, rather than to just make a few people happy, try and make decisions that serve for the most good."
09_14_2016,homeless,"My name is [ORGANIZATION]. And regarding the circumstances of our city,  the homeless and those that are vulnerable to the dangers that are overcrowded and an inaccessible city is, is it's blown. It's just blowing this out of proportion with young people, car accidents more and more and places I used to live or just they're dangerous."
09_14_2016,homeless,"There's a lot of young people losing hope with our environmental circumstances and  lack of housing and food having to steal and these multi so-called they're called multi-family housing but they're tyvek particle ted wheeler particle board four-story condoms for the rich and not encouraging any sort of a living livelihood we need rent control we need  living wage, just as much as you all earn. And we need consideration for our transit system, the people who serve us, whether they be police officers and businesses, our teachers, and our neighbors, homeless people. And that's why I'm here [ORGANIZATION] is last time I spoke with you, I asked for your endorsement for [ORGANIZATION]."
09_14_2016,homeless,"Anti-camping and temporary structure ordinance against the homeless are based on improper motives. I find the plaintiffs sufficiently state an equal protection claim. You lost, okay?"
09_14_2016,homeless,"Thank you. Okay, [DATE], please. Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel regarding the homeless."
09_14_2016,homeless,"And I've been working on a homeless situation for [ORGANIZATION]. And I...  I'm here to voice to the council. I've been trying to get some assistance, I guess, because I work alone and trying to look at different problems."
09_14_2016,homeless; affordable housing,"I'm working with the situation of the homeless situation in [ORGANIZATION], and I've seen the storm coming about the affordable housing and stuff. If they wouldn't have stopped the undivided house program that started back in [LOCATION], that would have stopped a whole lot of these problems with the homeless and the –  and the people that's middle retarded and everything with the [TIME] crisis center that we would have there, and for the families and everything that fell within the crack, as y'all called it back at that time, that couldn't afford affordable housing or whatever, until they could have got back on their [STREET]. Now, you're coming up DATE2, and you have duplicated everything that we would have done."
09_14_2016,homelessness,"People with disabilities have long experienced some of the highest rates of unemployment and unemployment of any group in this country. Here in [ORGANIZATION], 15 to 20 percent of our community are people with disabilities, and yet only about 2 percent of our city's workforce, in fact, are persons that identify as being someone with a disability. The unfortunate deleterious effects of unemployment and underemployment affect people with disabilities in all sorts of profound and often lifelong and devastating ways, including through poverty and homelessness as well as through racism."
09_14_2016,homelessness,"It doesn't operate in a vacuum. I mentioned earlier about our environmental declarations, our homelessness declarations, and  announcements and lofty ideals that we put out without any teeth, any [STREET] to monitor it, follow through. I would really like to see this worked on."
09_14_2016,homelessness,"Like when we talked about the homelessness [ORGANIZATION] plan to end homelessness, that we have action like we did back in [LOCATION] when [ORGANIZATION] was here and we worked on that. I have personal experience with agencies, nonprofits that pretend to be  help people with disabilities."
09_14_2016,homeless; homelessness,"And mostly they just exploit people with disabilities, and they get away with it because we don't know what it looks like to have our standards set. If you as the city, as an employer, can get this right, working with equity, minorities, even with the issues with homelessness issues,  We can set the standard for these nonprofits that, for example, I recently tried to get a job that had to do with housing, that a lot of disabled people are homeless. And we're promised so-called good housing, which turns out is not accessible."
09_14_2016,affordable housing,"Three, funds to develop new low-income housing that is affordable to youth and families with children with 30% or lower MFI. Again, I want to have the [ORGANIZATION] fund. account set up to transfer these funds for foreclosures to go into an investment fund, which then can't then be utilized for affordable housing."
09_14_2016,affordable housing,"I've stated I wanted to see more impartial position taken from the code enforcement people that are doing nuisance liens upon the sale to where we separate that completely from any  [PERSON] deals to nonprofits before these sales take [STREET] to transfer these properties to nonprofits. I want it to go into the [ORGANIZATION] fund and then be used toward affordable housing and children with families that might need that type of assistance. Issue number two on the redemption period, I do have a problem within [ORGANIZATION] that anybody goes in and touches that property without actually owning the property."
09_14_2016,housing crisis,"They are in a condition, like you just described, you're right, all over the city that is really egregious, and at a time where we have a housing crisis. So we have young people trying to buy their first home being outbid, and there's a vacant house down the [STREET] that maybe somebody would fix up if it was in the hands of a responsible property owner. And so that's a big part of the message here."
09_14_2016,housing crisis,"I appreciate that there's efforts to address the housing crisis from every conceivable vantage point, and this is one example. Aye. Thanks."
09_14_2016,affordable housing,"Well, I'm very pleased to support this zone change, and I appreciated the testimony [ORGANIZATION] from neighbors and others, some most in support, one opposed. Thank you. But this is definitely a zone change, and the intended development that Mr. [PERSON] outlined to us [ORGANIZATION] I think is really a fantastic step to provide more affordable housing product in our city and to do it in a very innovative manner, as Mr. [PERSON] is known to do."
09_14_2016,homelessness,"I'd like to start by thanking [ORGANIZATION] for their efforts to acquire and preserve [ORGANIZATION], as well as Commissioner [PERSON], and to note our support of the acquisition of this critical housing resource. Homelessness is a complex issue. There are individual factors, such as poverty or job loss or addiction, and then there are structural factors, such as shifting and insufficient public mental health approaches."
09_14_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"One of the most critical structural causes for homelessness is the loss of affordable housing. DATE0, the [ORGANIZATION] lost over 3 million low-income housing units, including a loss of over 2 million single-room occupancy, or [ORGANIZATION], housing units. These are typically the lowest barrier housing units available in a community, often offering DATE1 or [ORGANIZATION] rental options with low or no screening or application barriers."
09_14_2016,homelessness,"And not surprisingly, the increase in homelessness in this country largely mirrors this loss of affordable low-barrier [ORGANIZATION] housing. To provide some perspective, [ORGANIZATION] lost 50% of their [ORGANIZATION] stock over this timeframe. [PERSON] lost 60%."
09_14_2016,homelessness,"Here in [ORGANIZATION], we've lost about 75%. While [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] lost about 90% of their [ORGANIZATION] stock and saw homelessness dramatically increase. [PERSON] recently studied why they were climbing up the national homelessness rankings and attributed much of that climb to the loss of over 75% of their 14,000 [ORGANIZATION] units starting in [ORGANIZATION] and escalating over [LOCATION]."
09_14_2016,affordable housing,"We know that there is a difference between the housing that the market delivers and affordable housing, which is why we invest in affordable housing. But there are also important nuances even within affordable housing, and we need a greater variety of affordable housing options if we're going to be able to meet the diverse housing needs facing our community. The FAC0 represents a critical and scarce option in that housing continuum."
09_14_2016,affordable housing,"And the average [ORGANIZATION] income is just under $900. One of the residents has been living at the [ORGANIZATION] since [LOCATION]. The [ORGANIZATION] afforded him a housing opportunity initially on a DATE2-to-DATE2 basis and later on a DATE3-to-DATE3 basis, which he couldn't find anywhere else in the city, including some of the more traditional affordable housing options."
09_14_2016,affordable housing,"He believes that had the joist not been available to him at that time, allowing him to move in despite the fact that he had lost his ID and could not navigate the typical leasing paperwork and approval process, he would most likely still be on the [STREET] DATE0. In the short to medium term, the [ORGANIZATION] can be renovated and perhaps play a role as a relocation hub while we preserve other low-barrier housing options in the downtown and close end, particularly as we move forward as a community with our resiliency and seismic improvement efforts. And over the long term, the preservation of the [ORGANIZATION] should be looked at as an important part of an overall strategy to develop and preserve a diverse range of affordable housing options that, taken collectively, meet the housing needs of all of our community members."
09_14_2016,homelessness,Thanks for your time. It's a difficult issue to talk about because there are still 20-some residents trying to avoid homelessness there. But we also need to talk about bang for the buck.
09_14_2016,homeless,"He's not a saint. This is an extortionary deal, but, um,  [ORGANIZATION] means that there aren't just 20 or 30 or 69 cherry-picked winners in a pool of 3,000 homeless people. It's an awkward situation."
09_14_2016,homeless,"I'm the executive director at [ORGANIZATION], and forgive me, I'm going to speak  speak very quickly because we have limited time. First, I want to thank the Mayor and [PERSON] for the opportunity to respond to this appeal and share more about the proposed FAC0 project. Many of you are familiar with FAC1 and know the work that we do with homeless youth in the [ORGANIZATION] community, including over [ORGANIZATION] operating a number of different highly effective housing programs."
09_14_2016,homeless; homelessness,Some of you also know about our organization's commitment to preventing youth homelessness through our work with youth transitioning out of foster care. [ORGANIZATION] is currently one of the main providers for life skill transition services for foster care youth in the state. We began doing this work because we recognized a strong relationship between kids aging out of foster care and those becoming long-term homeless youth.
09_14_2016,homelessness,"This is especially true of those in foster care who become teen parents and lack broader family and community support systems. I know this council understands and appreciates the impact of homelessness and the impact homelessness is having on our community and the need now more than ever to come up with creative and collaborative solutions. For [ORGANIZATION], FAC0 and FAC1 have worked together to develop [ORGANIZATION] to address significant gap and need in our community."
09_11_2019,homeless,"All right. 851, please. Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding homeless children, kids living on the [STREET], and at-risk and unsupervised foster children."
09_11_2019,homeless,"So DATE0 I'm here to talk about homeless youth, kids living on the streets, and foster kids that are left unsupervised. They all share like experiences, inadequate supervision, high-risk living conditions, no positive role models, and there is no one protecting or teaching them healthy living practices. We have foster and homeless children scattered in 8,000 different places."
09_11_2019,homeless,"The homeless cure was created to elevate the homeless and foster care systems to become the best model in the country, not one of the worst as we are rated [ORGANIZATION]. While waiting for just the right foster parents, these children will be raised in wide open spaces surrounded with farming, orchards, gardening, fishing, real life ecosystems, sport and fitness parks, and then at the ranch, which includes chickens, pigs, goats, ponies, and horses. along with safe and caring daycare and revised education."
09_11_2019,homeless,"Next individual, please. Thank you. [PERSON], request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding [ORGANIZATION], placing boulders where homeless camps are currently residing."
09_11_2019,affordable housing,The voters passed the [ORGANIZATION] $[ADDRESS].
09_11_2019,homeless,"DATE0, we have spent $243 million on the homeless issue. This number keeps climbing [LOCATION]. Why is Commissioner [PERSON] not looking to the city she works for and [ORGANIZATION] who have set up agencies to deal with housing?"
09_11_2019,homeless,"Good morning. My name is [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and I would like to double and triple everything that she just said. And I would like to say that... Not wanting pollution, not wanting carbon is a great thing."
09_11_2019,affordable housing,"We have to bring the county together. And we have to bring the school district on board in order to have a robust tax abatement plan, which would allow us to get brownfield remediation followed by affordable housing or other community benefits. So I'll be asking for your help on that."
09_11_2019,affordable housing,"And so we're really charged with how do we manage that growth as a region? How do we make sure that we have transportation systems, affordable housing, a diverse and inclusive communities and a whole host of other things. One of the really fundamental things that we need to do as a region is, as we're growing more compactly, as we're creating a big backyard for everyone in our community, how can we make sure that people have access to nature?"
09_11_2019,homeless,And so I just... those are things that are important to me. I was homeless for [ORGANIZATION] and trying to find a safe [STREET] or find a public restroom without having to walk into a department store and feel the need to purchase something and being turned away because I don't have the money to make that purchase is it's it's a form of homeless discrimination and that needs to stop. Thank you very much.
08_05_2015,homeless,"Okay, next please, 18. Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding police civil rights violations during homeless sweeps. We had this talk a while ago, Mr. [PERSON]."
08_05_2015,affordable housing,"Commissioner [PERSON]. Thank you, Mayor. This item would make a change to our multi-unit limited tax exemption program for affordable housing."
08_05_2015,affordable housing,The goal of these changes is to increase the creation of affordable housing in market rate developments. Thank you. We have very few tools to incent the private market to create affordable housing.
08_05_2015,affordable housing,"One of the biggest barriers to achieving more affordable housing is the current $1 million cap on foregone property tax revenue available for this program. So we are seeking a modest increase to $3 million per year, which we estimate can produce 200 affordable units per year. If council approves these changes, the county commission must also approve this package before these changes will become effective."
08_05_2015,affordable housing,"Good morning, Mayor, [ORGANIZATION]. It is very exciting for us after working with this program for [ORGANIZATION]  And seeing the challenges that we have and the opportunities that could come about to bring this to you [PERSON] for approval so that we can increase the number of affordable housing units within that central city and areas that are very important to us. I will turn it over to [ORGANIZATION], who has more details in terms of the program changes and answer any questions you might have."
08_05_2015,affordable housing,"In terms of the cap and whether there is [ORGANIZATION] support for that, I think that that's there conceptually because they understand the need for predictability as well as clearly the desperation for affordable housing. I haven't had those conversations personally to be able to confirm with any certainty. So I just want to, this is a process question."
08_05_2015,affordable housing,"We provide a plan center, do one-on-one coaching and counseling, and also we do an [ORGANIZATION] trade show. So we do a number of services to help build the capacity of minority and disadvantaged contractors. We're here [LOCATION] to support the multi-program as an [STREET] to bring additional affordable housing units into the market."
08_05_2015,affordable housing,"We must use a continuum of strategies to provide affordable housing in livable communities. The cities that have a track record of actually building minority businesses and minority communities, one of the first things on the list is having a strong...  strong pool of affordable housing units that's critical to growing minority communities. And so I think it's interesting to note, and I think it's something that it's good that we have this [STREET], to have this continuum of strategies to bring affordable units."
08_05_2015,affordable housing,"The county was pretty strict on the $1 million cap. But I think times are very different in [ORGANIZATION]. I know that the county has been making, it's the first time, direct investments in affordable housing production."
08_05_2015,affordable housing,"So certainly they are as interested as we are and as [ORGANIZATION] is in trying to solve the affordable housing problem. crisis. I know [ORGANIZATION] is out of the country right now, but I understand that when she gets back, she will voice her support for this."
08_05_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"So this creates an opportunity for the private sector to get engaged  and i sat here before uh... several times and i know that uh... city uh... [INSTITUTION] their nonprofit community we're not going to be able to solve uh... this affordable housing crisis without getting the private sector engaged uh... as uh... commissioners also been pointed out there's only two tools right now on one is the uh...  the [ORGANIZATION] waivers, and the other is this program."
08_05_2015,affordable housing,"It's not obviously going to solve our affordable housing problem in the city, but it's a great step in the right direction. And we've had a few lately. The FAR bonus is another one."
08_05_2015,affordable housing,"So...  When ordinances are crafted or when we work with this, I hope that we'll follow Commissioner [PERSON]'s idea that we could have the city attorney office bring forth a report to share with this council and with the county commissioners showing that legally there is a basis for us to reclaim any property tax waivers, abatements, or whatever that are granted to people who start off providing affordable housing and  and then feel like, oh, I really absolutely positively need to have 100 percent market rate property. There should be, as the other gentleman from [ORGANIZATION] mentioned, some stick to go with hopefully a delicious carrot. That's not yet."
08_05_2015,affordable housing,"I appreciate the points that have been raised in the testimony and by Commissioner [PERSON], and we will certainly take a close look at those, and Mr. [PERSON] also about aspirational goals for minority participation. But I think this is a good program. You know, 200 units of affordable housing a year is not going to solve the problem."
08_05_2015,affordable housing,"But as [ORGANIZATION] said, things are starting to come together in pieces that are slowly here and there, I think, going to be producing more affordable housing in a time when we have a red-hot market that needs more.  proper incentives if we're going to get the amount of affordable housing that we truly need to serve all of our residents in [ORGANIZATION]. So this is a great step forward. I look forward to the county's consideration and hopeful approval of this as well."
09_13_2017,homelessness,"I just want you to know that. What we're talking about [ORGANIZATION] is not about homelessness, houselessness, et cetera. It's about behavior."
09_13_2017,homeless,"Mr. [PERSON] and Commissioners, I come before you on behalf of the [ORGANIZATION] neighbors, at least two entities on [ORGANIZATION] [STREET], my family, and really countless businesses and other persons, including certain homeless who have seen their neighborhood afflicted by an unchecked threat to our health, safety, and livelihood. Excuse me. I refer specifically to rampant illegal and unsafe behavior in southeast [PERSON] by certain bad actors."
09_13_2017,homeless,"I am not anti-homeless. I am anti-criminal. The focus is not on the person but the behavior, and there are plenty of behaviors that you should consider."
09_13_2017,homeless,"I can represent that a nascent electoral coalition is budding, nourished along the spectrum of nuisances to outrages and the perceived lack of concrete and permanent steps undertaken by our leaders. An expansion in homeless and transit programs combined with a more robust police presence must occur to promote health and safety. I highlight community policing cannot occur without more police."
09_13_2017,homelessness,"So the second thing I just want to mention is in the most recent point in time, none of us here are tolerant of behavior that crosses the line into illegal behavior, wherever it happens, and the mayor has been very clear about enforcing the law. But I will say one thing we have learned in [ORGANIZATION], and it's the same up and down the coast, is there has been a huge growth in what we call chronic homelessness. And the data that you know, because it was published, is people that are battling addiction or mental health crises or both, the dual diagnosis."
09_13_2017,affordable housing,"Recommended actions in this update are to set a fee for smaller homes similar to multifamily homes. The program will also continue to exempt affordable housing permanently, as well as accessory dwelling units through [ORGANIZATION]. Moreover, we think there is merit to the [ORGANIZATION] beginning to collect new person trip data from a variety of housing types, such that more varied rates can be set in future updates."
09_13_2017,affordable housing,"Give me a magic wand and I'll wave it and so be it. I think the mayor is probably –  My guess is the mayor's persuaded that's a good idea. Yeah, I think it would be a perfect informative tool to use in how we plan because we talk about affordable housing, low-cost housing, all those things, yet you don't, talking with [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] and ORG2, you know, they have all different kinds of fees that are waived that they have to pay, those kinds of things."
09_13_2017,affordable housing,This rate structure creates a clear incentive for developers to build smaller and therefore more affordable housing. We understand and support the new methodology using person trips to calculate [ORGANIZATION] rates. [ORGANIZATION] used data from [ORGANIZATION] showing large dwelling units having more people in them on average.
07_26_2017,homeless,"Everything we're talking about when we were talking about homeless issues on the last resolution is all involved in that plan. Everything we're talking about on poverty reduction is all involved in that plan. And we need to start understanding, especially from [ORGANIZATION], when you have people  Like [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] saying now is the time to begin to implement this."
07_26_2017,homeless,"We need to have these type of committees researching, planning, and looking over things to understand the greatest thing that can happen. And let's use a pilot project. Let's just talk to begin with on doing something for the chronic homeless in the city of [ORGANIZATION], but on a universal level through [PERSON]."
07_12_2017,homelessness,"Number two, I completely understand and empathize with the concerns that you have raised. And the budget that we just passed reflects that concern. We are being compassionate with regard to our response to homelessness."
07_12_2017,affordable housing,"[PERSON], amend relocation assistance regulations in affordable housing preservation and [ORGANIZATION] renter protections. Colleagues, first I'd like to present an amendment to swap out what was filed in the 710 amendments. That, as you will recall, was a minor fix."
07_12_2017,housing crisis,"Therefore, it's up to us to continue to take bold action to address this housing crisis using the tools that we currently have at our disposal, like mandatory relocation assistance. In [ORGANIZATION], the [ORGANIZATION] mandated that landlords in [ORGANIZATION] pay relocation assistance to tenants experiencing rent increases of 10% or more and tenants being evicted for no cause. There was an abundance of public testimony from housing justice advocates, community groups, and landlords and tenants alike, and it became clear that the community at large had a handful of outstanding questions about the mandatory relocation assistance legislation."
07_12_2017,housing crisis,"I'm sure it's no secret that this ordinance is one of the only almost ready-to-go tools we have available for us to address this housing crisis in [ORGANIZATION]. As an organization that's been representing most impacted renters for [ORGANIZATION], we're ecstatic to know that this is a long-term policy in consideration by the council. We look forward to shepherding policies like this in other jurisdictions around the state and look forward to participating in conversations about what a long-term strategy would look like."
07_12_2017,homeless,"I didn't last there, and then I'm a veteran. Now I'm under [PERSON] and I'm on food stamps. But I do think that if – I think the economy of the future will get worse and we will have more homeless people."
07_12_2017,homeless,"And it's one advantage, you know, in [ORGANIZATION] when people were homeless, we do have a lot of this what I call crystal magic, people's ability to get electricity from the sun, telecommute. I know some people actually write programs that have made $50,000 on an [ORGANIZATION] phone. So it's amazing how you can do that and be another [ORGANIZATION] or somebody like that."
07_12_2017,housing insecurity,"And that's union, it's represented and non. And no one should work full time in this city and face housing insecurity or basically poverty anymore. [ORGANIZATION] provide good jobs for the community."
06_22_2016,homeless,Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding opening a nonprofit business to benefit the homeless. Good morning. Welcome.
06_22_2016,homeless,"Good morning. My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I'm here to talk about the growing homeless population in [ORGANIZATION]. I've lived here for [ORGANIZATION], and in that [ORGANIZATION], I've seen it triple, triple."
06_22_2016,homeless,"Um, I myself am homeless. I've been homeless for [ORGANIZATION]. Um, I do have a job."
06_22_2016,homeless,"I'm having a real difficult time finding grants, or I don't know how to write a grant, nor do I have the money for a grant writer to open up a second-hand store, much like [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], to benefit the homeless. I work in a second-hand store. I've seen the amount of money they bring in."
06_22_2016,homeless,"I think it could benefit the homeless population by, you know,  bringing in money through the store and purchasing apartment complexes, houses, to put the homeless in these buildings, in these structures, and give them the jobs at the store. The apartments, the living situations can also provide more jobs and help people get off the streets. A lot of people seem to think that most of the homeless are drug addicts, alcoholics, which is not true."
06_22_2016,homeless,"Where we're staying, there are many, many homeless families living in their cars. We're chased out of parking lots. We have nowhere to go."
06_22_2016,homeless,"They're the homeless action team in my office, and if you would talk with one of them, let them know how to get in touch with you, and they might be able to put you in touch with some resources that you haven't found yet. Okay. Appreciate you coming."
06_22_2016,homeless,"I do, however, want to throw out a different [STREET] of looking at the approach. I had proposed to the [ORGANIZATION] commissioners that they needed to move into the tents and let the humans move into tents  the buildings and then approach their government through tents and see how effective they'd be. And you might say that that $288,330 might be better spent buying some kind of warmer blanket  for the homeless."
06_22_2016,homeless,"And I'm not trying to be the devil's advocate because I don't think the homeless are the devil. But as you can imagine, this kind of a blanket is not very warm, but it does look a little bit like a tinfoil hat for a tech generation. I mean, it's kind of glam rock, kind of [ORGANIZATION]."
06_22_2016,homeless,"Hopefully, we know there are other homeless activists who have presented in the past about people who have died from exposure and substance abuse while homeless. And I haven't heard any of those horror stories, so I hope that we had [ORGANIZATION]. But, yeah."
06_22_2016,homeless,"I think this is a matter that other people and I, myself, need to take under advisement. We're in a city that has thousands of people sleeping on the streets outside, presents on its budget and says, oh, we budgeted $600,000 for shelter-type services and we didn't expend it, but don't worry, it'll be there at [ORGANIZATION], right? It certainly doesn't seem to dovetail with the pronouncements about a homeless state of emergency."
06_22_2016,homeless,Take it out on homeless people. We'll get it from the feds. Am I wrong on this?
06_22_2016,homeless,"We'll read these together, but let's do 705 separately. Okay, let's take [DATE], please.  authorize an intergovernmental agreement with [ORGANIZATION] to establish [ORGANIZATION]. Well, this is [ORGANIZATION], and I appreciate the good work that's been done between the city and the county."
06_22_2016,homeless; homelessness,"Thank you.  for the creation of [ORGANIZATION]. I think in [ORGANIZATION], I've observed the city and the county have had unprecedented levels of collaboration to address crises involving families and individuals experiencing homelessness. And it's time to take this collaboration to the next level by forming [ORGANIZATION]."
06_22_2016,affordable housing,"A joint combined system will be more efficient, more nimble, and most importantly of all, be easier to navigate for those in desperate need of our assistance and services. In working towards completing this agreement, the chair and I have shared four basic principles—  first and foremost, create a new joint office that would be situated to serve its clients, the men, women, and children who need safe, stable, and affordable housing. Secondly, we had a get-or-done approach."
06_22_2016,homelessness,"The [ORGANIZATION] you are voting on [ORGANIZATION] implements a vision of deepened city-county collaboration to address homelessness that has existed for [ORGANIZATION], but started to become even stronger with the creation of a home for everyone two [ORGANIZATION] ago. It represents an important opportunity to deliver on the commitment we have made to people experiencing homelessness, that we will do everything we can to support their efforts to get off the streets and back into permanent housing. Just as we know that how our providers deliver services is as important to achieving successful outcomes as the resources that they have available, how we organize the work that we do at the governmental level profoundly affects our ability to achieve the best possible outcomes for people experiencing homelessness."
06_22_2016,homelessness,[ORGANIZATION] will change how we organize our work in ways that will have significant positive impacts on the effectiveness of our efforts to address homelessness. [ORGANIZATION] will bring together on one team the city and county staff with the greatest expertise and the deepest commitment to ending homelessness. That team will be guided by the same vision and values that guide the larger ORG1 initiative.
06_22_2016,homeless; homelessness,"We will come to work [ORGANIZATION] committed to creating a community where homelessness is rare, brief, and one time because everyone has access to a safe, affordable, and accessible housing unit. [ORGANIZATION]... We'll use the existing and unprecedented increased city and county investments in homeless services to build a system of care that helps thousands of people [ORGANIZATION] escape homelessness."
06_22_2016,homelessness,"Specifically, once fully implemented, the system will help more than 4,300 people a year move off the streets and out of shelters and back into permanent housing. It will help at least 5,600 people a year avoid homelessness altogether through improved prevention and diversion strategies. and we will be able to offer at least 650 additional safety off the streets options, shelter options [TIME] to people who have not yet been able to find permanent housing."
06_22_2016,homeless; homelessness,"This office will focus resources on those who are most vulnerable and prioritize the elimination of the significant overrepresentation of communities of color in the population of people experiencing homelessness. We will continue to strengthen the community-led planning work that occurs within a home for everyone,  More specifically, we will be expanding the role of people with lived experience of homelessness, the faith, philanthropic, and business communities in helping us realize the creation of a community where everyone has access to safe, affordable, and accessible housing. We will work to create the most efficient and equitable contracting process for our community-based organizations that deliver homeless services.  and ensure that collectively and individually, we are accountable to the community for the outcomes that we commit to achieving and are continuously engaged in evaluating and improving the quality of services that we deliver."
06_22_2016,homeless; homelessness,"We will strengthen the ongoing collaboration with the other critical government agencies that touch the lives of people who are or are likely to experience homelessness. We will work closely with [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] to address the need for deeply affordable and permanent supportive housing. We will work [ORGANIZATION] with ORG2 to make sure that individuals and families are moving seamlessly between homeless and anti-poverty, aging, disability, and veteran services."
06_22_2016,homeless,"We will work closely with [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, [PERSON], and other criminal justice partners to address the needs of homeless people who they are coming into contact with. And there will be a close working relationship between [LOCATION] and the county's mental health and addiction services, looking for opportunities to better align critical health and housing resources. And finally, this office will strengthen our partnerships at the state and federal levels."
06_22_2016,homelessness,"We want to sustain the tremendous success that we've had with the effort to end veterans homelessness and we will use [ORGANIZATION] to pursue opportunities to collaborate on similar upcoming federal initiatives to end family, youth, and chronic homelessness. The success of [ORGANIZATION]  will depend on staying true to the collaborative nature of the office itself. The fact that this is an ongoing shared effort of [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]."
06_22_2016,homelessness,"It will also depend on realizing the opportunity for expanded collaboration that it offers at every level with people experiencing homelessness, non-governmental community partners, and the other local, state, and federal government partners we have. Getting to this point has not been easy. but I couldn't be more excited that we've arrived here."
06_22_2016,homeless; homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION] will not by itself solve the crisis of homelessness that we are experiencing in our community, but it gives us the best opportunity to maximize the collective impact of our efforts and to take the resources available and help as many people as possible successfully escape homelessness. Good morning, Mayor, Commissioners. My name is [ORGANIZATION]."
06_22_2016,homeless,"I'm the county's chief operating officer, and I'm just going to give you a brief summary of the highlights of the intergovernmental agreement we're asking you to approve [ORGANIZATION]. The [ORGANIZATION] has an initial [PERSON] term. It transfers existing city contracts for homeless services to [ORGANIZATION]."
06_22_2016,homeless; homelessness,"Hello. The creation of [ORGANIZATION] is the contemporary local government equivalent to FAC0. We have a clear and compelling vision, and that clear and compelling vision is to decrease by half the unmet housing need amongst people experiencing homelessness throughout [ORGANIZATION]."
06_22_2016,homeless,"The [ORGANIZATION] mission going forward will be different. Somewhat narrower, but more impactful, we'll be able to focus on housing production, preservation, tenant services, eviction prevention, and we'll be able to align our resources, capital and operating resources, to focus on our mission, which will include permanent supportive housing. We will also maintain an ongoing commitment for the homeless management information system, because it's braided within our larger policy and program development construct."
06_22_2016,homeless,Thank you. And the other thing I'd like to recognize is the homeless assistance and resource team itself within [ORGANIZATION]. This was something that they fully subscribed to at the outset.
06_22_2016,homeless,"I'll speak for the city. I think... DATE0 on the job [PERSON] was to read all historic documents related to the management of homeless services in the city and in the county, including the [ORGANIZATION] report, which recommended this alignment of resources."
06_22_2016,homelessness,"And in my opinion, and to the many people out there in the community who I speak to on a [DATE] basis, ending homelessness, getting people off the streets and into housing is the number one priority of the citizens we serve. I'm not saying that they don't want police and fire. I know that they want that as well, but I think that people want us –  to do our best to help get people off the streets."
06_22_2016,houseless,"But [ORGANIZATION] is not mentioned. Certainly the facility will continue to be managed by ORG1 per the agreement that...  whoever owns it is going to continue to manage it. But there's going to be some ongoing operating funds that [ORGANIZATION] 2 will have to have, because they're going to not only do what they do now, but they'll have services like laundries and showers and such, which other houseless people who are, wants to get a shower will be able to come."
06_22_2016,houseless,"Okay. I just want to make sure that that is seen as a service for houseless people and therefore likely to be funded or if you could promise for it to be funded, that would be great. What about the single points of contact that the mayor's office currently has for people reporting concerns about people living outside or people needing services?"
06_22_2016,homelessness,"How is that going to be handled? So, at this point, that is, again, that hasn't been in the category of things that [ORGANIZATION] just mentioned in terms of recognizing that there are a variety of services that are being performed that touch homelessness. Maybe they stay where they are currently located."
06_22_2016,houseless,to do culturally specific outreach to houseless people. It's not perfect. It still needs work.
06_22_2016,homelessness,"And I say that because [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] and PERSON2 and everybody involved in the ending homelessness team on our side of the river, in my mind, has always been one of the bright lights of our work on this side of the river. And plus, they're not just focused on ending homelessness. They've provided a values proposition for all of our work."
06_22_2016,homelessness,"So every time we took something up, they were there reminding us that homelessness had to be at the forefront of what we were doing. So for me, it's really important [ORGANIZATION] that they have given the green light to this exercise. And that would not be, I think the case had not all this work gone into the details and to this soft landing."
06_22_2016,homelessness,"There's something very powerful when we're all sitting together and getting the same presentation. May I propose a friendly amendment that we have at least an [DATE] joint session where the home for everyone, including the performance and update on the joint office for homelessness, is addressed? And we do it at a time that's enough upstream so that we can anticipate budget issues ahead of our formal budget process."
06_22_2016,homelessness,"So I appreciate that you have set a floor, and you've been very honest with us that that's the minimum resources you're going to need to do the job, because we should not ask you to do this job unless we're making that commitment. And I would just note, because there's a precedent for this, in [ORGANIZATION], this council, without an identified source of resources, converted all the one-time money for homelessness to ongoing. In fact, it was one of the presents that was handed to Mayor [PERSON] when he came into office."
06_22_2016,homeless,"This is about...  transformational change. And I've done homeless services and housing development for [ORGANIZATION]. Not often do you see one branch of government giving up authority, giving up budget authority."
06_22_2016,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION], just sit down and give us your name, [ORGANIZATION], and tell us what's on your mind. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]. I'm homeless also, and there are two blocks.  that have remained vacant for [ORGANIZATION] in back of the old FAC0, and they'd make an excellent encampment for most probably all, all of the people that are camping on the sidewalk."
06_22_2016,homeless,"No, no, you can say something right now. They're designated as a park. Well, no, no, but there are homeless people, and that's an emergency."
06_22_2016,homeless,"Well, no, there are homeless people, though, Mayor [PERSON]. But they take priority, I would say, I'm sure. And this would cost less than a million dollars."
06_22_2016,homelessness,"Homelessness doesn't need to be commodified as the people are charging you so much money for this. You said something in the first [ORGANIZATION] article. You wanted to do something with a lot of things that would cost less.  that this would work, and no one has told me why not."
06_22_2016,homeless,"It's to authorize an intergovernmental agreement with [ORGANIZATION] to establish [ORGANIZATION] for  the ordinance introduced by Commissioner [PERSON], which, interestingly enough, you can actually convert that amazing emergency blanket into a superhero cape. It really looks fabulous. We pulled that off at the last co-op."
06_22_2016,homeless,"I don't know, that well-spoken gentleman back there, well, there were a few of them, you too, but the other one, they, I don't know what's his salary, [ORGANIZATION] and we're not through this homeless epidemic. I'm [PERSON], so...  this is, to me, it seems like we're keeping the poverty going because of the poverty industry. And the whole notion of social cleansing, when you bring up your favorite philosopher, what was his name, [ORGANIZATION]?"
06_22_2016,homeless,"We could have a very interesting philosophy lecture that would go on for [TIME] discussing that, but it comes as a slap in the face to the community that has seen your draconian regime of Stalinist arrests of activists, arrests of homeless activists, as an attempt to gag our participation in the process. So you guys probably never wanted to be a camp leader of a sort of a camp vibe, and... As a consumer of poverty services, I can say sometimes they're not working well and that I'm frustrated by the socialism of the [ORGANIZATION]."
06_22_2016,homeless,For us to be thanking ourselves because we're helping the homeless is shameful. We need to be ashamed of ourselves that we're even speaking about people that are homeless. Not thanking ourselves for something that hasn't even happened yet.
06_22_2016,homelessness,So  I'm kind of at a disagreement with you on thinking purchasing properties for the city is the answer to decreasing homelessness. Adding more inventory is going to be the answer so you don't keep driving up the rents. We need more inventory in the marketplace.
06_22_2016,homeless,"That's why, again, I want to start seeing more talks with people like [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], certain investors from the private sector willing to step up, do homeless campuses, devote a tremendous amount of money, And that's the direction we really need to focus on. Thank you."
06_22_2016,homelessness,"i think he mentioned is a little bit less than that but my main point is that um  What we haven't had here are any metrics. When the [ORGANIZATION] plan for homelessness started [STREET] [DATE], I don't know if it had any metrics in it either. If it didn't and we don't now, we would be repeating the same mistake."
06_22_2016,homelessness,"But when you start a project, it's great to have a goal of ending homelessness. But when you're going to pay people  $78,000 salaries for people who've been on the payroll since [ORGANIZATION], $86,000 salaries for people who've been on the payroll since [LOCATION]. It's good to have metrics towards those results as a proportion of the overall picture."
06_22_2016,homeless,"And it's very difficult here in [ORGANIZATION] because we have a growing population. It's hard to find accurate data about how –  homeless populations are impacted in areas that are experiencing an economic boom. But I hope that the next time that one of these confabs happen, there will be greater specifics and hopefully some success numbers where we can actually talk about hundreds of people reduced in the number of people sleeping outside and more people in permanent supportive housing that aren't rent burdened."
06_22_2016,homeless,"And I especially want to thank our homeless assistance and resource team, or otherwise known as [ORGANIZATION], the [ORGANIZATION] team. I read [ORGANIZATION] where the new mayor of [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], has to deal with one problem, or many problems, but one of the problems is that  On [LOCATION], 25% of city employees in [ORGANIZATION] don't show up for work. That's a problem."
06_22_2016,homelessness,Why don't we combine city and county efforts on homelessness? But it's the kind of thing that in practice is incredibly difficult. It requires enormous commitment from a large number of people.
06_22_2016,homelessness,"Well, [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], all of you, thank you again. Let me make a couple of contextual comments here at the end. One is that I think it's important to remember that this action is of a piece with our larger effort here on housing and homelessness, and it's also of a piece with what's happening nationally.  and first think back to what we've done together over [ORGANIZATION] to show our commitment to this issue."
06_22_2016,affordable housing,"One, we declared a state of emergency. Two, we increased our commitment of tax increment resources to affordable housing to something that,  I don't think any other city has done. That is 45% of all remaining [ORGANIZATION] funds, some $340 million dedicated to affordable housing projects that are now starting to happen."
06_22_2016,homelessness,"Again, good work. The [ORGANIZATION] model that has led to this collaboration [ORGANIZATION] and the budget commitments that the city and the county and [ORGANIZATION] and others have been making. So there's a local effort here that this is consistent with,  It's also consistent with the national dialogue, and I want to let you know that my commitment for DATE1 that I'm serving in this office will be to continue to both support that local effort and to continue the national dialogue, because we have a homelessness problem, and I think it's important to remember that so do a lot of other cities."
06_22_2016,homelessness,"And that's why we gathered the [ORGANIZATION] mayors here back in [ORGANIZATION] to talk among our colleagues about what are they doing, what's working. And in fact, [ORGANIZATION] and you, [PERSON], and I flew down and looked at  another model of how homelessness can be addressed in [ORGANIZATION]. That hunger continues on my part of where can we find another good idea, where can we share a best practice, and obviously [ORGANIZATION] that we successfully met together is one example of where cities around the country are trying to do similar good work."
06_22_2016,homelessness,So DATE0 I'm going to go to the [ORGANIZATION] meeting and  be at the ORG1 meeting and once again try to find more tools that we can put to work here. But I think that national discussion among cities that are all trying to do this work at a time where the national homelessness challenge is huge.  is a good idea. So you've got my commitment both to keep this progress going locally and to keep that constructive dialogue going nationally that I think has served us well.
06_22_2016,affordable housing,"Then we'll do 707 through 714 together. Let's take [DATE] and then the rest is a package. 706, authorize the purchase of property located at [ADDRESS] at a price not to exceed $2 million to support the development of affordable housing."
06_22_2016,affordable housing,"A key element of the community-led [ORGANIZATION] is the acquisition of land or land banking for the purposes of developing much-needed affordable housing in the interstate urban renewal area. [ORGANIZATION] is the first step in fulfilling this promise to the community by the acquisition of this parcel on FAC0, which will support the development of at least 50 new units of affordable housing, housing which,  under our newly adopted preference policy, will give former displaced residents and those at risk of displacement priority access to housing. Here to talk more about this is our Assistant Housing Director, [ORGANIZATION], and [PERSON], I guess."
06_22_2016,affordable housing,"However, we feel that there are still some additional soil contamination we'll have to address. And we also know that there's some lead and asbestos in the existing buildings that we'll have to address. None of those we feel are major issues, something that's well within the realm of our capacity to clean up and address and have –  affordable housing development on the site."
06_22_2016,affordable housing,"I'm speaking on Measure No. [ADDRESS] at a price not to exceed $2 million to support the development of affordable housing. The ordinance is introduced by Commissioner [PERSON], who I suggested wear a superhero cape. One thing I don't understand is how we missed...  the Victorian housing movement to put humans in shelters."
06_22_2016,affordable housing,"Thank you, colleagues. i'll let [ORGANIZATION] walk through this in more detail i'll just say FAC0 provides for 59 units of affordable home ownership and it also removes 18 homes that are are violating their tax exemption status and then 708 through 714 approved six projects located in southeast southwest north and northwest [ORGANIZATION] which will bring it bring in a total of 105 units of affordable housing to low and moderate income [ORGANIZATION]ers  With that, I'll turn it over to [ORGANIZATION]. Unless, PERSON2, did you want to say something?"
06_22_2016,affordable housing,"I was going to bring up some totals. But, yes, so the first measure, the resolution is to introduce or approve, as we do [ORGANIZATION], for the single-family program. homeownership tax exemption program as well as remove then any of the properties that we've identified have not met the owner occupancy requirement or has sold over the price limit in the first sale from the builder to the homeowner and then we've also been very busy with applications for  the multi-program in order to, which is the only program we have functioning right now with private developers in order for them to include any affordable housing within the  extreme amount of development that's happening across the city."
06_22_2016,homeless; homelessness,"And so with this, these are units that are going to be built anyway, but by being able to offset the cost of their reduced rents with this tax exemption, we're able to have [ORGANIZATION] of affordability. And by providing this program ongoing [DATE] with a continued amount of  expected foregone revenue, we're able to maintain a portfolio of this number of affordable units, even as others expire and new ones would get approved. So even though it's not a program that's able to serve the lowest income people, up to 30% median family income, as we've talked about with the homeless issues [LOCATION], or people transitioning out of homelessness, this is part of the continuum to...  do work for the community in the spectrum of housing outside of what [ORGANIZATION] is able to affect through direct funding."
06_22_2016,homeless,"And so I want to do good things. I also believe I'd like to be a lobbyist for free community colleges. So it's one thing to be homeless and just have shelter, but it's another thing to be fed and also to use your mind and train for some other kind of job."
06_22_2016,affordable housing,Okay. Item 728. Establish a construction excise tax to fund affordable housing initiatives from an inclusionary housing fund.
06_22_2016,homeless,"At [ORGANIZATION], we serve about 2,400 individuals a year and their families with comprehensive substance use treatment and mental health treatment. In fact, 20% of our 2,400 people are the city's homeless. We offer the full continuum of care from medical detox to residential to day treatment and outpatient services."
06_22_2016,affordable housing,"That's the affordable housing bond referral. On [ORGANIZATION]? On [ORGANIZATION] [DATE], yes."
06_21_2017,homelessness,"And I have a lot of experience working with immigrant and refugee population as well as just any marginalized community. And I feel that this issue, as anybody who comes to visit [ORGANIZATION] or people who commute can see, you know, we have a lot of housing issue and homelessness and housing affordability issues. I get a little emotional."
06_21_2017,homeless,"I mean, it takes a long time to get approved for Section 8. It is a long, painful [STREET]. And many people, while on that [STREET], fall prey to addiction because they lose their housing and they become homeless, to domestic violence because they're in the process of losing everything."
06_21_2017,homeless,"Last one, and we are closing the record. As a former homeless person, I think that homeless people sometimes are trying to commit suicide, and a person should be forced to go to a shelter and be dropped off there and be fed and get some help. If they want to walk out, that's okay, but there should be an attempt."
06_21_2017,homeless,"There are a limited number of carryovers into [ORGANIZATION] that include the following. There is $750,000 in [ORGANIZATION] to further support [ORGANIZATION], $689,252 to complete the third and final phase of the ORG2 program,  [ORGANIZATION], $27,000 at [ORGANIZATION] that will expand support for elderly and disabled adults. There's $100,000 at [ORGANIZATION] for a records management project in preparation for the [ORGANIZATION] building move."
06_21_2017,affordable housing,"PERSON0. Well, this is about making sure that we have affordable housing in the southwest corridor light rail line, which we're all hopeful will be built [DATE]. And the key is to make sure that the affordable housing opportunities are there at the outset and not an afterthought."
06_21_2017,houseless,"So what is that costing the community to have these planes? And why is that more efficient than a patrol car? Because even if he has to respond to a scene and then turn around, it seems to me that's still a more cost-effective [STREET] to be operating in a city that struggles with trying to find financing for even things like houseless services."
06_21_2017,affordable housing,And we are starting a pilot for accessory dwelling units where [ORGANIZATION] would underwrite the cost of providing accessory dwelling units for longtime owners within the neighborhood who could then benefit from the earned income from those accessory dwelling units. Those would be secured by a deed of trust in favor of the city. And would there be a requirement that they be for affordable housing rather than for FAC0?
06_21_2017,homeless,"733, amend [ORGANIZATION] with [ORGANIZATION] to authorize [ORGANIZATION] budget allocation to ORG1. Very good. Come on back."
06_21_2017,homeless,"We've not solved the problem, but it is at least encouraging that here in [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON], we have been able to reduce the number of unsheltered homeless on the streets. That counters the narrative that's being seen in GPE2, [PERSON]. GPE4, the greater [PERSON] area."
06_21_2017,homeless; homelessness,"And while we will get the disaggregated data later, we are all supposing that there are increased self-reporting of both addiction and mental health issues related to those who find themselves in the situation of homelessness. And in addition, the number of chronically homeless also went up. So lots of work to do, but we need to redouble our efforts working with the county and the other partners in [ORGANIZATION] at [ORGANIZATION].  to find a path to sustainable funding going forward."
06_21_2017,affordable housing,"Don't go far. Item 734, authorize 10 subrecipient contracts totaling $3,386,865 for services in support of providing affordable housing. Good [TIME]."
06_21_2017,affordable housing,"The ordinance is adopted. Next item, please. 735, authorized funding in an amount not to exceed $9,700,000 to [ORGANIZATION] for the construction of a new 153-unit affordable housing development."
06_21_2017,homeless,"We've had several meetings out there. We've met with [ORGANIZATION], was invited to meet with the superintendent out there at [ORGANIZATION], was invited to further meet with their Title X representative, as well as attend board meetings, all of which have been well-received. Title 10, or Chapter 10 representative is somebody that works with the families in the school district that are homeless or at poverty."
06_21_2017,homeless,"And they're very excited for this project. They have, I think they said about 3% of their children are currently homeless out there. And this is much needed housing."
06_21_2017,homelessness,"We also are working with [ORGANIZATION] as well. [ORGANIZATION] has over [ORGANIZATION] of experience working with at-risk populations and homelessness, and we've come to realize that a roof is only part of what needs to occur in approving the long-term resiliency from homelessness, and this requires a collection of services. At ORG2, our resident services will focus on housing stability, income advancement,  connection to wellness services, and long-term life goals."
06_21_2017,homelessness,"The combination of these things increase long-term stability and resiliency from homelessness. As a note, we are also in pre-development for our FAC0 project, which will be located kind of around the corner on FAC1 and FAC2. Having this proximity will give them further adjacency to services connecting to wellness, employment access center, and other services that we provide."
06_21_2017,homelessness,"And Mayor [PERSON], I want to honor your earlier suggestion to be succinct, but I think it's always worth taking a moment to celebrate the strong partnership between the city of [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] and our commitment and shared vision to end poverty. homelessness and ensure that everybody in our city has a roof over their heads, projects like these that make that possible, along with all the work that you're doing DATE0 around tenant protections and making sure that there's building supply in the pipeline. So thank you for partnering."
06_21_2017,homelessness,"and obviously at high risk of becoming homelessness, particularly in this market. 40% of the units are family friendly and I know that's something Commissioner [PERSON] has certainly been talking about here on this council. 61 of the units are two bedrooms 92 are one bedrooms and as you mentioned this is a model partnership."
06_21_2017,homelessness,"Well, I think, you know, at [ORGANIZATION], what we really were trying to focus on is maximizing units. What we're seeing, even in our transitional housing, you know, our goal is to reduce homelessness and work with populations that really are underserved. So what...  If we were to do bigger units, it would be more costs, and you would get less units."
06_21_2017,affordable housing,"I know everybody's anxious to end [ORGANIZATION], but I wanted – I think it's really important for people like [ORGANIZATION] and everybody to hear from someone who's actually benefiting from this type of program. This is so exciting. You know, I've talked about affordable housing, and it's just – I couldn't be more excited about this."
06_21_2017,homeless; affordable housing,"In [ORGANIZATION], when I was the vice president of the board of directors of a private social service agency in [ORGANIZATION] that provided housing and shelter to homeless families, I never thought that I would be in a position, because I was making a lot of money at the time,  that I would ever be living in affordable housing. And when I lost my job during the recession and I lost my home and I lost my pension, affordable housing saved me. And, in fact, at your urging, I wrote an email and I copied all of you on a rather lengthy email to [ORGANIZATION] expressing my desire to get involved in these programs and some of my background and experience in this.  area."
06_21_2017,affordable housing,"And like I say, I never thought when I was on that board of directors that I'd be living in affordable housing. As our economy continues in this situation that it's in and people are underemployed and the cost of education is so prohibited, we're going to have more and more people who do not make enough money during their career to set aside money for [ORGANIZATION] or any kind of retirement. And they're never going to be able to buy a home."
06_21_2017,houseless,"Programs like this are looking to the future to help people that, through no fault of their own,  cannot afford housing, and so I'm really excited to see this. I will say it's frustrating that the vocal citizens who keep coming up here and demanding to know what you're doing about housing the houseless aren't here to hear these last four agenda items. It's really frustrating and..."
06_21_2017,affordable housing,"We have a wonderful partnership with [ORGANIZATION]. It's in a part of the city that desperately needs...  affordable housing. And one thing that I've learned over [ORGANIZATION] is that we often get complaints from people out in these neighborhood associations about the quality of the affordable housing, but almost invariably they're referring to the private market housing, which is very poorly constructed and often not very habitable."
09_14_2017,affordable housing,"And sadly, you know, with gentrification, oftentimes they get pushed out to the suburbs because, you know, the buildings become more expensive, the land becomes more expensive. You know, the disjointedness between the FAR and the [ORGANIZATION] is,  And the design criteria exacerbate that problem because it makes it more valuable. And I know we have a lot of affordable housing units proposed and in [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION] now."
09_14_2017,affordable housing,"Those are really vulnerable to demolition because of the fact that, you know, and many of them do occupy affordable housing units. For instance, there's a building on FAC0 and FAC1. Alder, I think it is, that has a [ORGANIZATION] affordable housing and a small business, a small local business in its main floor."
09_14_2017,affordable housing,"That may not be possible if those heights, as proposed in [LOCATION] plan, go forward, because there would not be an incentive to maintain those buildings, but instead to demolish them and put in luxury. I'm not opposed to luxury townhomes or luxury buildings, but it's just I think we need more affordable housing, obviously, and more affordable not only housing but businesses, so that local businesses both in [ORGANIZATION] as well as in [LOCATION] can –  still operate."
09_14_2017,affordable housing,I'm testifying [ORGANIZATION] representing [ORGANIZATION]. Research is clear that the most affordable and most sustainable building is the one already built. We believe that saving our historic buildings in the central city saves massive amounts of affordable housing units.
09_14_2017,affordable housing,"And you'll be very surprised, you're going to see an absolutely first-rate museum when it opens in [ORGANIZATION]. But our long-term plan, [LOCATION], basically, is to build up five stories with inset floors for housing. for student and affordable housing that would include a museum on the first floor and perhaps even much-needed parking below."
09_14_2017,affordable housing,"The second phase is the developer's solicitation and development planning process. In phase one, the development of the Broadway Corridor Framework Plan, which started in [ORGANIZATION], it included an engagement of a stakeholder advisory committee and extensive outreach to other community stakeholders. The intent of the framework plan and engagement of the committee was to inform the feasibility of acquiring and developing the site, largely based on an assessment of the development potential and value, and investment requiring to deliver on public infrastructure requirements and community benefits such as affordable housing."
09_14_2017,affordable housing,"I'm [PERSON], here now in my capacity as a member of [ORGANIZATION]. And not to reiterate, but just to add on to what [PERSON] said, I'm on this committee in my capacity as a member of [ORGANIZATION] and also as an affordable housing provider. I am involved in this phase of the development."
09_14_2017,affordable housing,"In particular, I feel strongly that maximum heights in the west end should be right zoned to 100 feet. But in a larger context, I hope to illustrate with my...  with my little handout, how right zoning maximum heights to 100 feet in order to protect iconic views will have effects that go far beyond the sale of picture postcards. One example of the synergistic effects of right zoning maximum heights might be that by deterring demolition of historic properties, those saved properties could be subdivided into multiple well-designed sustainable living units, which will introduce new affordable housing while protecting the character and the appearance of the neighborhood."
09_14_2017,affordable housing,We are especially supportive of slight FAR creases made in FAC0 in order to ensure that more projects will participate in the inclusionary housing program. Increasing allowed heights above base allowances only by provision of identified public benefits and making affordable housing the only bonus available everywhere. And bonuses and transfers that will preserve and upgrade historic resources without reducing much needing housing in the central city.
09_14_2017,housing crisis,"We also want to strengthen incentives that prioritize building affordable homes on-site rather than pay-in-lieu. I want to conclude by reminding [ORGANIZATION] that [ORGANIZATION] is in a declared housing crisis, but we did not get here [TIME]. Part of the solution is strengthening tenants' rights."
09_14_2017,affordable housing,"Part of the solution is securing more funding for affordable housing. And part of the solution is allowing enough housing of many different kinds to be built. It supports our comp plan goals, our climate goals, and our sustainability goals."
09_14_2017,affordable housing,"For example, the FAR on sites directly south of [ORGANIZATION] have a 6-to-1 FAR, yet the area south of [ORGANIZATION] has maximum bonus heights that are either equal to or lower to the areas north of [ORGANIZATION]. Even with a 6-to-1 FAR, most sites would need an FAR bonus or transfer to develop the maximum heights, and therefore the requested change would not diminish the applicability or the effectiveness of the new affordable housing or historic resource priorities for FAR bonuses and transfers. Thank you."
09_14_2017,affordable housing,"So that's the increased development allowance. So in order to be consistent with the comprehensive plan provision, you really need to have some additional public benefit there. And what we've suggested in our proposed amendments is a mechanism that will support affordable housing or historical buildings, one or the other, in a couple of different ways."
09_14_2017,affordable housing,"You've heard plenty of testimony not to increase building heights since it promotes teardowns of existing affordable housing and historic architecture. The notion that some historic buildings could be saved by transferring FARs to nearby parcels is highly concerning for me, as it will only exacerbate an erratic height differential rather than building mass that is based on that human-scaled civic space. I'm speaking not only from an analytical mind that focuses on the statistics, economic analysis, housing targets, and employment numbers, but I urge you to allow your intuitive, perceptual minds to make decisions too."
09_14_2017,affordable housing,"The additional height will also allow us to achieve the following. Up to 500 affordable housing units, a world-class gathering [STREET] that combines mixed-use urban environment with nature, open and available to all of [ORGANIZATION]'s citizens and visitors. Thinner profile towers that allow for more light and air between the buildings and for more views through the site, effectively creating a more visually porous development, and redevelopment that maximizes the public's investment in existing infrastructure with a 3 million gross square feet high-density mixed-use development."
09_14_2017,affordable housing,"Was it really DATE0 of effort there? In general, we're supportive of many of the proposals for [ORGANIZATION], including [PERSON], which was approved.  vitally important for all the people in our neighborhood as well as the commuters who come from the east side and all the  all the diverse elements who used the FAC0 bridge to get into the city. We are also in favor of the elimination of the bonuses within LOC2 as well as the elimination of most of the bonuses including the addition of the historic resource bonus and the affordable housing bonus."
09_14_2017,affordable housing,"so long as there is certainty that the projects can actually get the additional FAR outlined in the framework and regulatory layers and costs are not amended in. The current FAR transfer requirement is what introduces uncertainty into whether a project can actually get the additional density needed to build beyond the base FAR and achieve the affordable housing and seismic support for historic properties the plan prioritizes, and we support it. [ORGANIZATION] has submitted written testimony that goes into more detail, but [PERSON] should add certainty and remove the barrier of requiring site-to-site transfer for additional [ORGANIZATION] by simply allowing [ORGANIZATION] up to the height limit."
09_14_2017,affordable housing,"In contrast, testimony given at the [ORGANIZATION] hearing would remove all certainty if landmarks and design review processes could remove height in [ORGANIZATION] on a case-by-case basis. Simply put, the risk of FAR and height reductions during the review phase would directly conflict with the goal of maximizing affordable housing production, and [ORGANIZATION] opposes any reductions to the FAR height through design or landmarks review. And because [ORGANIZATION] supports making affordable housing and seismic resiliency bonuses work, we urge [ORGANIZATION] to maintain the minimum FAR proposed in the draft and not increase minimums."
06_13_2019,homelessness,"Now, I'm going to offer an analogy. When I was the housing commissioner, as a condition of getting federal funds, to address homelessness. Every city in the country had to adopt what was called a [ORGANIZATION] plan to end homelessness."
06_13_2019,homelessness,"No one who adopted such a plan expected to end homelessness in [ORGANIZATION]. And the only city that had the nerve to sort of publicize all of the progress it made towards, quote, ending homelessness was [ORGANIZATION], was in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]. And it turned out they ended homelessness by cherry picking one category, ending homelessness but leaving everyone else behind."
06_13_2019,homelessness,"And I just think that as with the [ORGANIZATION] plan to end homelessness, sometimes we set ourselves up for those naysayers to say, well, you didn't achieve that goal. Well, yeah, but in the [ORGANIZATION] plan to end homelessness, we transformed our systems in how to address homelessness. We learned a hell of a lot, and we made a hell of a dent."
06_13_2019,homelessness,"But we didn't end homelessness, but it was never our intent to declare that as a [ORGANIZATION] goal. It was a condition of federal funding. So I appreciate your response, and I fully support your work."
07_24_2019,houseless,"Okay. Item 687, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding the proposed houseless village on FAC0 in [ORGANIZATION]. Good morning."
09_09_2020,homelessness,"First, I want to thank Mayor [PERSON] for helping the [ORGANIZATION] mount a successful forum on homelessness. Thanks for attending. And I want to thank Commissioner [PERSON] for speaking to the [ORGANIZATION] recently and urging us to come speak here more frequently."
09_09_2020,houseless,"And the next group is [ORGANIZATION]. They have one location in downtown near ORG1 and I think they're building a new location in [ORGANIZATION]. So this project is houseless young adults leading research, designing and building a backyard habitat."
09_09_2020,homeless,"But in our efforts to deliver equitable aid to the community through this program with a new focus on [ORGANIZATION] organizations, it's really interesting to then take that conversation even further into equitable distribution of our dollars. And my preference really is [ORGANIZATION]-led organizations and organizations. people with lived experience, if we're talking about an organization that serves the homeless population, for instance."
09_09_2020,houseless,"If we could also have that posted for the public to see where you would be  having like a grid showing the categories of services and community members that are served, whether it's [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], immigrant, impoverished, houseless, who are also on the management, the administration, you know, the leadership. And also other ways in which people can cross check that see the different ways of services. So if it's a generic phrase and a framework for everybody to see, we can  let people know about good things that are happening."
09_09_2020,homeless,"Amen. [PERSON] and...  agreement with [ORGANIZATION] to authorize [ORGANIZATION] budget allocation to the [PERSON] and extend it to [LOCATION]. Colleagues, I'd like to make an amendment."
09_09_2020,homeless; unhoused,"As you all know, [ORGANIZATION] has a strong partnership with [PERSON] through our [ORGANIZATION]. This partnership was initially formed in [ORGANIZATION], and this [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] amendment facilitates the ORG1-approved [ORGANIZATION] budget allocation to ORG2. DATE2, the [ORGANIZATION] also contains additional federal funding related to the [PERSON] emergency to help people who are living on our streets, in our shelters, and in other means unhoused."
09_09_2020,homelessness,"Hi. And as a slight footnote to my vote, since the ordinance is now adopted, [ORGANIZATION], I want to thank you in particular for your hard work and your forbearance. Obviously, you and I are in discussions about how to retool our efforts around reducing [STREET] homelessness and connecting people to the services that they need to be connected to."
09_09_2020,homeless,"There's clearly a demand for and a need for additional shelter space and potentially sponsored camping spaces that are safe  that have proper hygiene and running water and trash collection services and connections to services and support. And I want the community to know I hear that concern, I share that concern, and it will be my intention going forward to address those concerns. And we would love to have the full-throated and energized support of our colleagues  at a home for everyone and in the joint office of homeless services."
09_09_2020,homeless; homelessness,"But absent that, [ORGANIZATION] will have our own discussions about the $37 million currently allocated towards those efforts. And we will always ask and have a duty to always ask whether or not those funds are  are going towards the issues that we believe are the most important. And right now, from my perspective, it is [STREET] homelessness and it is addressing the chronically homeless on our streets and doing everything we can to resolve their situations and help get them off the streets and keep them off the streets."
09_09_2020,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]. We're here to talk about two different projects that are subject to inclusionary housing, where buildings with 20 or new residential units have five different options to choose from in order to provide affordable housing on site of their development or by sending it to another site. They're also able to reconfigure those different units into particular sizes to have a  more family size units or they can pay a fee in lieu of providing the affordability."
09_09_2020,housing insecurity,"That's the core functionality of this technology. [ORGANIZATION], along with the entire country, is in the midst of a very important conversation right now with regards to public safety and how we are reimagining public safety for ourselves. With the leadership of folks like Commissioner [PERSON], we're asking hard and difficult questions about how we want to address issues like mental health crises and housing insecurity."
07_31_2019,homeless,"First of all, thank you both for being here and if you're not feeling well, especially thank you for. I have spent [ORGANIZATION] on the council or maybe a little bit more being one of the champions for humane and rational approaches and solutions to our homeless crisis. But we've always been clear as a council to separate out status from behavior."
07_31_2019,homeless,"I also want to thank you for being here, and I know this is the second or the third time that you've had the opportunity to be here. And I think it's important for people to hear all sides of this conversation. And what I hear from [ORGANIZATION] is they want a humane solution to the homeless crisis."
07_31_2019,affordable housing,"Voters approved a change to the state constitution in [ORGANIZATION], allowing the city to loan bond proceeds for affordable housing to private entities, rather than owning all the bond projects themselves. That change will upend how tenants are placed in bond properties. Instead of overseeing leasing activities directly or through home forward, the [ORGANIZATION] is shifting gears and setting expectations for developers and property owners about how to find tenants from the priority communities included in the policy framework."
07_31_2019,homeless,"Good morning. Hi, I'm [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION]. So I find it slightly hypocritical."
07_31_2019,affordable housing,"Therefore, we are recommending an [ORGANIZATION] rental registration unit fee of $60 per year with an exemption for regulated affordable housing and adjustments with the consumer price index West. With the average market rents in [ORGANIZATION] being equating to $1,425 per month, the fee equates to approximately one-third of 1% of the [ORGANIZATION] average rents in [ORGANIZATION]. And now I'd like to turn it over to [ORGANIZATION] to add some comments from [ORGANIZATION]."
07_31_2019,affordable housing,Commissioner [PERSON]. Thank you for your work on this. Could you explain a bit more about the exemption for affordable housing under the guidelines of [ORGANIZATION] to households earning no more than 60 percent?
07_31_2019,affordable housing,"How does somebody qualify for that? So, Commissioner, we would be proposing that this is regulated affordable housing, so agreements that landlords have in [STREET] with the city or other jurisdictions that have assured that they are keeping rents at 60% or below. So it would not be a market solution necessarily, but where there are regulated units that are requiring you to keep your rents affordable at 60% [ORGANIZATION] or below."
07_31_2019,affordable housing,Okay. Did you consider having an exemption for any affordable housing and saying what that is? So you mean looking at the market to try to determine what the rents weights were and if their rents were a lesser amount than what the...
07_31_2019,affordable housing,and dwellings in [ORGANIZATION] and all of those funds flow for the development of new affordable housing. So we actually do have a construction excise tax in existence in [ORGANIZATION] which captures that new development. So we did not consider a different structure for the rental registration fee that would charge only new units being created versus older existing units.
07_31_2019,affordable housing,"My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I'm an apartment building owner with my wife, [PERSON]. We own a building on FAC0 and FAC1, and we provide an affordable housing alternative in that area. On [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] came out with an article that... basically outline this proposal."
07_31_2019,affordable housing,"We estimate that by [ORGANIZATION] of this fee scheme, the city of [ORGANIZATION] will have collected $58 million that will do nothing to create more affordable housing. It's ultimately a tax on renters, impacting those most who have lower incomes and do not have the good fortune of living in regulated affordable housing, which receives the special carve-out. With a housing supply shortage, what rational jurisdiction would meet out punitive disincentives to housing providers?"
07_31_2019,affordable housing,"The city of [ORGANIZATION] is creating inequity across all rental housing providers by imposing a fee for the sole purpose of funding multiple duplicative programs already implemented or addressed by other better equipped agencies. If you're truly striving to provide solutions to the problem for the lack of affordable housing across the continuum of housing, then you would continue the path outlined by the legislature through [ORGANIZATION] Bill 2001 and [ORGANIZATION], which both work to create diverse, inclusive, and vibrant housing opportunities throughout our city. Additionally, the city should reassess its posture towards housing providers it has demonized over [LOCATION]."
07_31_2019,affordable housing,"So we believe that the proposed rental fee will be harmful to [ORGANIZATION] renters by reducing new development in low to moderate rents. pricing of the housing, reducing upward pressure on housing cost and reducing the quality of existing rental housing. This tax combined with additional state and local legislation introduced over [ORGANIZATION] makes it difficult for housing providers to provide affordable housing and it reduces the incentive to develop new units or keep existing units on the market."
07_31_2019,affordable housing,We all need it. So I encourage everyone in the room to think about people and their family or their friends that need this accessible affordable housing. We deserve to live lives of dignity just like you when you will get to the point where your bodies will change and you will need it too.
07_31_2019,affordable housing,"These include properties slated for affordable housing, brownfield redevelopment projects, and long-term environmental monitoring for city facilities. We have two professionals here to answer any of your questions, but I think that captures what we're doing. And as I mentioned, this is a renewal of an existing agreement in a heavily regulated area."
07_20_2017,housing crisis,"And over [ORGANIZATION], the number that were amended or rejected was zero against the withering pressure for us to be faster to address the issues of this city. I mean, if you pick up your newspapers [LOCATION], you will see I am being excoriated broadly for being too slow. to respond to the housing crisis."
07_20_2017,homelessness,"But that was a different job. The goal here is a values-driven proposition around making the community a better [STREET] by addressing issues like the housing and the homelessness issue, policing issues and whatnot here. And there is a timeliness aspect to this."
07_20_2017,affordable housing,"Next item, [ORGANIZATION], approve application under the multiple unit limited tax exemption program for church apartments located at [ADDRESS]. So, colleagues, this is one of many innovative programs that the city has to address housing affordability in the city of [ORGANIZATION]. These programs are complementary to the recent voter-approved housing bonds programDATE0and aligns with the goal of increasing the supply of affordable housing."
07_20_2017,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION]'s market, as everybody understands, is experiencing very low vacancy rates, and the multi-program provides a crucial incentive to develop affordable housing units. The church apartments is just the latest project to come before the council for approval of a multi. The council has approved 20 projects over [ORGANIZATION], which is projected to result in over 400 affordable housing units becoming available in [LOCATION]."
07_20_2017,affordable housing,"To discuss this project,  particular program at the church apartments we have representatives of [ORGANIZATION] including director [PERSON] if you wanted to start us off sir thank you very much council um kurt [PERSON] housing director  I'm pleased here [ORGANIZATION] to introduce [ORGANIZATION], who is the chief staff in charge of this program. And I would underscore that we are entrusted not only by you, [PERSON], but also by ORG2 to administer this tax abatement program. It was designed as a means by which to tap the hydraulics of the private market and the private sector to incentivize them to provide affordable housing that would otherwise not be made available."
08_03_2016,homeless,I also stopped into [ORGANIZATION] and said I could be a volunteer. So it looks good if I do run for a community college school board and I'm a volunteer in a [INSTITUTION]. I like the fact that you have women and it's not as religious.
08_03_2016,homeless,"I stayed at [ORGANIZATION] when I was homeless [ORGANIZATION], and I had to go to a mandatory Christian service. But not that [ORGANIZATION] is a bad person, but I'm glad the ORG1 shelter is not religious and they do have women. Thank you."
08_03_2016,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] are both in the same boat. My background is affordable housing. I built homes for over 200,000 people."
08_03_2016,affordable housing,I had trouble coming up here. This town has room for improvement. There's four things you need for affordable housing.
06_15_2016,affordable housing,"No, it never happens. Let's take communications item number 661, please. Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding affordable housing."
06_15_2016,homeless,"So we are for the professionally run homeless camps. But our organization is not really for just letting anybody pitch a tent anywhere they please because it's not really helping them get off the [STREET]. The second thing I'd like to bring up is now that we have inclusionary zoning, I hope that you guys work together to actually stretch those boundaries as well."
06_15_2016,homeless,"Hi. 687.  except three federal grants totaling $1,023,071 from [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION], the administration of the regional homeless management information system, and ORG1 supportive housing programs. Thank you, Mayor. In [ORGANIZATION], ORG2 applied to [ORGANIZATION], or [LOCATION],  For an DATE1 renewal of three continuum of care grants in the total amount of $1,023,071, the funds will go towards planning administration of the regional homeless management information system and for supportive housing programs that will be programmed through [ORGANIZATION] and ORG6."
06_15_2016,homeless,"I'm sometimes impressed that the refugees in northern [ORGANIZATION] are getting better treatment than our homeless here in [ORGANIZATION]. So I want us to bring up this. bring us up to an international humanitarian aid standard where we have, if people are forced to live in camps and tents, they are living in very high-quality, heated-with-sanitation-services kinds of tents."
06_15_2016,homelessness,"PERSON0 went to [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], and he saw the urban blight, he saw the destruction, the homelessness, the poverty, the rioting, the controversies, and he said, I'm going back to GPE2, and this is not going to happen to my country. I will build housing. And [ORGANIZATION], I've been there, they...  What passes for standard impoverished housing, or just like a regular old blue-collar worker would have, excellent windows, double-paned windows, excellent insulation, excellent electricity, excellent water pressure systems,  cleanliness, Scandinavian design, which focuses on simplicity, durability, and beauty, elegance."
06_15_2016,homeless,"So there may or may not be within this data management, systems management environment  a [STREET] of calculating what is the amount of social workers on staff for different kinds of crisis, from alcoholism to domestic violence. What is the amount of cultural centers, libraries, computers, libraries,  Things that are cultural center related, which the Swedish term for that is culture huset. It's much more interesting than a library, and it's not a de facto [INSTITUTION] like we have in our libraries where women like me are afraid to enter libraries for fear I will be offered crystal meth or sex sales or any other kind of unfortunate activity.  situation."
06_15_2016,homeless,"Of all those concerns that are very close to my heart, I'm also very much on this agenda item about [ORGANIZATION]. I don't know if you noticed, but recently there was some suggestion that Russian hackers had gotten into the Democratic database about [ORGANIZATION]. If anybody wants to hack it, the [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], is a database."
06_15_2016,homeless,"If you're homeless in the city of [ORGANIZATION], you'll be given a barcode that associates. We're not barcoding people. It's just a [STREET] to scan people and bring the records up faster."
06_15_2016,homeless,So [PHONE]. It doesn't mean a person's homeless. It just means they're in poverty and they're engaging with services at [ORGANIZATION] or at transition projects or maybe [ORGANIZATION].
06_15_2016,homeless,"He also has to now deal with the peace shelter and the fact that our wonderful, loving city shut down the shelter in [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION], they won't have to worry about [ORGANIZATION]. They chased the homeless out."
06_15_2016,affordable housing,"So it's been a success. And in fact, as you know, it's been such a success that we're now faced with a whole new set of problems and a whole new set of opportunities. We're popular, and that means there's less affordable housing, and we have more traffic congestion, and there's people and businesses that are being displaced."
06_15_2016,housing crisis,"I believe it thoughtfully plans for both a growing [ORGANIZATION] and an aging [ORGANIZATION]  with more options for people to age in [STREET], and a focus on neighborhood centers where people can walk, bike, and take public transportation. It keeps an eye on East [ORGANIZATION] to help it thoughtfully grow without displacing the longtime residents in [ORGANIZATION]'s last affordable neighborhood, and it addresses very thoughtfully two of our most urgent challenges, advancing equity and responding to our housing crisis. I want to begin by thanking my colleagues."
06_15_2016,affordable housing,"We need more housing, and all height and floor area ratio bonuses should be tied to affordable housing, all of them. This is a huge priority for me, and I will be watching closely to see if any of the bonus programs coming out of the current processes are watered down for affordable housing. I don't like downzoning, as many of my amendments to the plan showed."
06_15_2016,affordable housing,"If they don't have another option, they might go and buy a house east of [ORGANIZATION], thus helping to [STREET] up prices there and contribute to the gentrification of east [ORGANIZATION]. But if we make it more feasible to build things like or convert buildings to duplexes and triplexes in their inner east side, that same couple might choose to do that, and then they're not driving up prices and contributing to gentrification in these portlands. Of course, we are going to build some affordable housing with tax dollars."
06_15_2016,affordable housing,"In this budget, we made a major contribution of city funds to building affordable housing. but we are not going to address the overall problem of housing affordability just with taxpayer-funded housing. We're going to have to allow for the market to help."
06_15_2016,affordable housing,"i think the whole afternoon council calendar could be described with this combination of words hooray at long last we finished [ORGANIZATION] of work on the comprehensive plan and now we're taking up a question that has lingered for some time around our community so i'm very very pleased that we're here and at the team of people in city government from the auditor's office to the police bureau to [ORGANIZATION] to [PERSON]  to my office that have been working so well together. I want to thank a couple of people at the outset, one who's on his honeymoon, [ORGANIZATION], and then there he is, [PERSON] from my office, who worked really hard on this, and then Officer PERSON2 from FAC0, who's still recovering from a very scary car accident, but [PERSON] took me on a ride-along and said,  and opened my eyes to the fact that we still had in our city, even in [DATE], what was already a very healthy real estate market and people desperate for affordable housing, now it's more so, even then we still had hundreds of houses of this type that are vacant, abandoned, and toxic for their neighbors."
06_15_2016,affordable housing,"We also have the option of receivership, which allows the city to petition the [STREET] to appoint a housing receiver to temporarily take ownership while a house is repaired and put back out for affordable housing. So I believe that receivership will complement the foreclosure program and work to make sure that no one is gaming the system, but that instead we're getting this housing back out into responsible ownership and affordable use. So these are changes before us [ORGANIZATION]."
06_15_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,"How would that particular code provision about city purchase be utilized? Let me be clear. I'm very happy to see it, because I don't...  I think that since we're going to such a lot of trouble and since we have such an affordable housing crisis, there's a lot of potentially good uses to rehabbing the properties and putting them back into serviceable use rather than getting demolished and have [ORGANIZATION] built on the site."
06_15_2016,housing crisis,"I was like, what?  [ORGANIZATION] to give these people, you know, it's been [LOCATION] since we sat here in these same exact seats and had, you know, the declaration of a housing crisis. And, you know, within DATE2, you're going to be gone. And I just would hate to see this awesome promise turn into another toothless tiger."
06_15_2016,homeless,"You know, we still don't have a solution to the homeless. You know, we've targeted five houses. And while that looks good on paper and it looks good in the newspaper, I just really urge you guys."
08_09_2018,affordable housing,"They help us respond to broader community needs, including affordable housing, equitable community development, and other opportunities to enable current residents and businesses to remain and grow with smart transit investments. We are being joined by a number of agency and bureau partners [ORGANIZATION], and I want to thank them for their contributions. They include [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, [PERSON], [LOCATION], and [ORGANIZATION]."
08_09_2018,affordable housing,"The transit need is real, too. And so the categories of these conditions of approval really fall into one, future updates, which we're doing right now, one of those, community engagement, affordable housing investment strategy, economic development and business mitigation, and transit service enhancements. [ORGANIZATION], the ORG0 General Manager, has led with talking with you on the status of some of those transit service enhancements around added service in [ORGANIZATION] as well as some of the DB goals."
08_09_2018,affordable housing,"And the Local Action Plan helps the city meet its equity goals in that respect as well. The affordable housing needs and targets identified in this corridor were grounded in the citywide targets, the 10,000 unit target adopted with the comprehensive plan. This is also the first major transit project to come along since the [ORGANIZATION] debated and ultimately adopted anti-displacement policies in the 2035 Conference of Plan."
08_09_2018,affordable housing,"One, just highlighting the importance of around affordability in the relationship of transportation and housing. These are the two highest costs, the proportion of a household budget, and many within our region are cost burdened and where it  their combined cost of housing and transportation exceed the ideal of 50%, and then all the [STREET] up to 105%. So the more that we can do to co-invest and co-locate our affordable housing and our transportation investments, particularly on transit, the more we may be able to help reduce that burden."
08_09_2018,affordable housing,"But now if you can go to the next one. When we started this project as [ORGANIZATION], we were really excited as [ORGANIZATION] to apply an investment areas approach starting with the land use and the community goals for affordable housing, for business growth and retention, and access to education in this part of the region. And so when we began this project, we created a steering committee that really reflected that and considered how."
08_09_2018,affordable housing,"about maybe halfway there right now if you go [STREET] out there. And we're excited that it's not only affordable housing that's being provided there, but also a community space for [ORGANIZATION] that can really meet the needs of the people who live in that area. And you'll hear more about that project from your own staff."
08_09_2018,affordable housing,"We have been an early partner on the project on the corridor to ensure that we are able to capitalize on the transit investments with new opportunities for affordable housing and to work early to mitigate and prevent displacement. Some of our earliest work was as a funding partner with [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and ORG2 on the FAC0 development. We contributed just over $1.8 million to make that an affordable development, and we're very proud to be a partner with that."
08_09_2018,homeless,"And so I am very pleased to once again acknowledge the  by [ORGANIZATION] to put a $652 million bond measure. For those counting, that's $5 per month for the typical homeowner on the [ORGANIZATION] ballot. We hope through that mechanism not only to better serve...  the folks in this corridor and to avoid unnecessary displacement, but to ultimately house as many as 12,000 individuals who are homeless or in danger of becoming homeless."
08_09_2018,affordable housing,"We have a division safety project, which will add crosswalks and medians. It's a long time coming, and construction will begin [ORGANIZATION]. You saw earlier the FAC0 affordable housing development is nearing completion and will be done by DATE1 of DATE2."
08_09_2018,affordable housing,"This memorializes our expectations to provide culturally responsive resources for business mitigation and approximately 300 to 600 units of affordable housing, of which 20 to 25 percent will be located in [ORGANIZATION]. It also called for additional north-south transit lines, which are now... Sorry, can I...  I can finish your thought."
08_02_2018,affordable housing,"Next up, [ORGANIZATION]. I'm [ORGANIZATION], senior project manager with [ORGANIZATION] and formerly with ORG1. So while I was there, I was managing the [ORGANIZATION] project, which is an affordable housing project currently under construction."
06_03_2020,housing crisis,"The latter of these options keeps those ADUs in the rental pool within the city and thereby assists with the current housing crisis. So with that, I want to see if [ORGANIZATION], the residential inspections manager, has any input from his side that he'd like to add. PERSON1, before you move on, could we get a question in here from Commissioner [PERSON], please?"
06_03_2020,housing crisis,"We don't subsidize other industries in that manner. Why would we subsidize people who are just building wealth and creating profit for themselves while not contributing, not relieving  not contributing to the relief of our housing crisis. So I'm happy with the [ORGANIZATION] extension."
06_03_2020,affordable housing,"Also, as we are seeing [ORGANIZATION] and more broadly acknowledging, our history and systems have built inequities based on race into the structure of our city. When other factors that contribute to livability and health are considered, for example, living wages, educational opportunities, access to healthcare and affordable housing, dense cities are actually safer from pandemics than less dense areas. [ORGANIZATION] professor [PERSON] said it well recently."
06_03_2020,affordable housing,"Thank you very much. I appreciate it. I know this is the result of countless [TIME] of working with our infrastructure bureaus, our community members and organizations, and affordable housing developers."
06_03_2020,affordable housing,"I'm [PERSON] with [ORGANIZATION]. DATE0 I'm also speaking on behalf of [PERSON], which you may recall consists of a diverse set of affordable housing organizations from across the [ORGANIZATION] metro area. I'm here to express our support of Amendment 6, deeper affordability in full option."
06_03_2020,affordable housing,"Our written testimony provides more detail, but I would like to highlight some of the positive impacts that this will have on our ability to provide affordable housing. While we acknowledge that the existing affordability bonuses as well as the proposed deeper affordability option do not require or inherently guarantee affordable housing as part of the residential infill project, we would like to emphasize the important role that these bonuses play in opening the door to an option that currently does not exist. As we have previously noted, increased density translates to serving more households with less subsidy and or serving households at lower incomes."
06_03_2020,affordable housing,"An increase in FAR allowances in conjunction with an increase in number of units allowed also provides a path forward for providing more affordable family-sized units per lot, which we know are sorely needed across the city. The modest increase in height allowance with this amendment is also an important piece to providing affordable housing developers with the flexibility to design and develop housing that responds to the needs and preferences of the communities we serve. We look forward to ongoing dialogue about ways that we can work with [ORGANIZATION] to continue expanding affordable housing choices throughout the city, mitigating displacement that has occurred, and to be proactive in preventing future displacement."
06_03_2020,affordable housing,[ORGANIZATION] needs the [PERSON] to be expanded in order for us to realize the benefits of residential infill. We also want to encourage you to adopt [ORGANIZATION]. This amendment was created in collaboration with affordable housing developers who have said they can and will use it.
06_03_2020,affordable housing,"Most of [ORGANIZATION] is zoned for single dwellings, and this amendment will allow affordable housing developers to compete for those lots and build more affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]. Inclusive [ORGANIZATION] is our anti-displacement policy that we adopted [ORGANIZATION]. The deeper affordability bonus amendment would help us address more than half the goals that we established in that policy."
06_03_2020,housing crisis,"We don't support this amendment because it would potentially exclude wide swaths of some neighborhoods from these options, continuing the trend of unaffordable, single, detached dwellings. Again, we appreciate that you're working towards greater housing options for [ORGANIZATION] while balancing trade-offs with existing development. With that said, we are currently in a housing crisis, and we need to act swiftly."
06_03_2020,housing crisis,"[ORGANIZATION] is clearly not a standalone solution for our housing crisis, but it is an important foundation. Thank you. Thank you."
06_03_2020,affordable housing,"This amendment could only be used by developers, mostly non-developers, who are planning to build regulated affordable housing. If I came to you [ORGANIZATION] with a proposal to ban affordable housing on 77% of the residential land in [ORGANIZATION], you'd probably be horrified. but that's what we've done in our zoning code."
06_03_2020,affordable housing,"We can not only fix that, but with Amendment 6, give affordable housing providers a competitive advantage in securing land to build on. Changing our zoning code won't solve all the inequities that there are in housing, far from it. This council has taken some great actions, like [ORGANIZATION], and there are other actions yet to come."
06_03_2020,housing crisis,"[ORGANIZATION] is a grassroots pro-housing, pro-tenant organization. We are proud to testify as advocates for a holistic suite of policies that will address the housing crisis from multiple angles. So thank you, [PERSON], for making the time for this issue amid this moment of national crisis."
06_03_2020,homelessness,"By passing the residential infill with [ORGANIZATION] 4 and 6, we can renounce the racist pattern of exclusionary zoning that has shaped our city for [ORGANIZATION] and open up our neighborhoods to more Portlanders with abundant and less expensive housing options. Yet as important as the completion of this project is, more action is needed. A citywide anti-displacement strategy, new funding to fight homelessness and build deeply affordable homes, and zoning reforms to bring larger mixed income buildings to currently exclusive areas near transit and jobs."
06_03_2020,affordable housing,"I know this is a limited incremental step, but it's such a step in the right direction  [ORGANIZATION] addressed our dual housing crises, the middle class being forced out and the loss of any affordable housing and the displacement of so many people from the city already in dire situation because of the pandemic. Addressing both of these in concert is what we need to do to move forward, build a coalition. With that, I think it's really important that we include Amendment 6 as part of this package, making sure that deeply affordable housing developers are getting an advantage here and able to see, develop housing that will help the most disadvantaged in the city."
06_03_2020,housing crisis,"I strongly encourage the [ORGANIZATION] to support Amendment 6, in addition to [ORGANIZATION] 4, and allow people to choose the type of housing that works best for them. I would also like to encourage the [ORGANIZATION] to oppose Amendment 7,  It does nothing to stop or reduce demolitions and uses vague terminology such as historic to stop housing from being built in certain areas of the city. The housing crisis is a crisis that affects each and every one of us and it up to every person and every neighborhood to do its part in providing more housing."
06_03_2020,affordable housing,"I'm PERSON0. And I do want to thank all of you, the mayor and commissioners, for being here and for [ORGANIZATION] of work that have gone into this. I'm testifying to express my support for the residential infill project, and especially for Amendment 6, the deeper affordability bonus, which I know you've heard in previous testimony, affordable housing providers have been asking for so that they can make the best use of their resources at homes for people who need them."
06_03_2020,affordable housing,DATE0 I was the beneficiary of the affordable housing program and it radically changed my life for the better. It allowed me to become a homeowner also. I fully support the deeper affordability amendment.
06_03_2020,affordable housing,She was interviewing a woman about a plan for affordable housing in her middle class neighborhood. The woman said she didn't think those who would live in the housing would fit in her neighborhood and didn't want the housing there. [TIME] she talked about how she didn't understand those who say that everyone doesn't have the same opportunities.
06_03_2020,affordable housing; houseless,"The pandemic has only increased housing prices. We need to continue to find more sources of funding for affordable housing, rental assistance, and houseless programs. I do appreciate the efforts the city has made."
06_03_2020,affordable housing,"I've also seen  Within my own direct neighborhood, I live actually just off FAC0, and I love all the new influx of neighbors and businesses and thriving activity. I've also seen the darker side of our current code system, where several houses in my block, older homes that were smaller, were taken down, demolished, and then put up with much more expensive single-family homes on the same lot, thus displacing former neighbors, a  getting rid of afforda- naturally affordable housing and replacing a neighborhood with older, wealthier, and whiter community members. Um, specifically with respect to the issues at hand [ORGANIZATION], I wanted to express my support for Amendments 1 through 4, um, which will create more housing at lower prices in neighborhoods across the city and welcome new neighbors, uh, to everywhere across, uh, our great city."
06_03_2020,affordable housing,"So while we're living in [ORGANIZATION], but somehow also [LOCATION] and [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], let's not remain stuck in [DATE] to DATE5 when the exclusionary zoning policy whose intent and outcome was to discriminate against [ORGANIZATION] was established in the vast majority of our neighborhoods. So for the record, [ORGANIZATION] applauds [PERSON] and ORG2 for working with the community to find a constructive solution to the infrastructure problem. We strongly support the deeper affordability bonus to help nonprofit developers provide more affordable housing for people who need it."
06_03_2020,affordable housing,"Amendment 6 will greatly help to reduce the per-unit cost for developers and create opportunities for below-market housing on all lots. Additionally, I hope you reject Amendment 7 as this will carve out several high opportunity neighborhoods from developing more affordable housing than an average [ORGANIZATION] household can afford. Also, I hope you consider that while the residential infill project and these amendments might seem isolated from the reckoning our nation is facing [ORGANIZATION], they are not."
06_03_2020,affordable housing,"I'm here to speak on their behalf. [ORGANIZATION] strongly supports the residential infill project as it supports the [ORGANIZATION] comprehensive plan's vision to increase the amount of affordable housing across our neighborhoods. Regarding the amendments that are before [LOCATION], we support amendment number six, which will allow the creation of affordable housing with six plexes."
06_03_2020,affordable housing,"If with half of those units affordable to residents earning 6% of the area media income. We think this would be a great pilot opportunity for the affordable housing bonds that have recently been passed in [ORGANIZATION] and by [ORGANIZATION], a great [STREET] of encouraging nonprofit developers to support this work. We also encourage [PERSON] not to stop here, but to continue with the implementation of [ORGANIZATION]."
06_03_2020,affordable housing,"Smaller does not mean that it's going to be more affordable. In my neighborhood, single-family homes are being torn down and multi-units are being put up and they're empty because they're not affordable. We need amendments that are going to deter the demolition of sound, stable, and affordable housing."
06_03_2020,affordable housing,"So everybody knows in a pandemic, we're in an economic depression. And I'm going to follow on with what [ORGANIZATION] said. This is the worst possible time when you would want to accelerate displacement by encouraging the demolition of natural affordable housing to build expensive housing."
06_03_2020,affordable housing,The [ORGANIZATION] did not reject the mandatory affordable housing unit as part of a fourplex. What happened there was the state prohibits a local jurisdiction from requiring this. So it wasn't about intent.
06_03_2020,affordable housing,"Unlike a lot of people and maybe not very popularly, I am a builder, a developer, and a real estate asset manager. And one of the things that's particularly important to me is amendment number six, the deeper affordability amendment. As I know firsthand how important it is to reduce per unit development costs for new affordable housing."
06_03_2020,affordable housing,"Without an incentive, I only buy one. We can use incentives to get affordable housing. We need more housing than ever to house our neighbors, and we need more tax revenue more than ever."
06_03_2020,housing crisis,"We already know that densifying our housing stock is one of many essential tools for fighting the climate crisis. That's why [ORGANIZATION] is here to support [PERSON] and the amendments recommended by ORG2. ORG3 is a crucial foundational step in undoing some of the harms of [ORGANIZATION]'s racist housing codes, adding much needed density to our [LOCATION] area, increasing affordability to address our housing crisis and combating the climate catastrophe."
06_03_2020,homelessness,"Amendment 6 brings us closer to that goal by ensuring that the dense housing built as a result of this project isn't just a luxury housing giveaway to developers, but is available to folks in the middle unaffordability zone. All that said, passing this project, even in the best possible condition, is not enough. We need to use this momentum to surge forward on anti-displacement policies, building more deeply affordable homes, allowing mixed income buildings, and adopting strong funding and zoning reforms to fight homelessness."
06_03_2020,affordable housing,"The addendum says if [ORGANIZATION] is implemented,  then let's make it truly a measure for affordable housing and equitable housing. The board agrees at this time that the 80 MFI, that's median family income housing that is to be provided with all these new dwellings be actually 60 MFI. And that is because during the time of [PERSON], we have seen enormous gut punch to our economy, as well as people's incomes."
06_03_2020,affordable housing,"Anyway, the best time to build small plexes, duplexes, and little a affordable housing throughout [ORGANIZATION] was [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION], but we didn't do it. And so, you know, these things aren't, we're not going to catch up [TIME]. But I think that this [ORGANIZATION] would be an important step in that direction."
06_03_2020,affordable housing,"My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I am here on behalf of [ORGANIZATION], or [ORGANIZATION], to express our support for using the residential infill project as one [STREET] to establish new truly affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]. I want to echo the ask from our partners [ORGANIZATION], including ORG2 and [PERSON]."
06_03_2020,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] has long prioritized inclusive neighborhoods and prevented displacement through community development advocacy and tenant organizing in the J district. In the J district, we have a large number of renters who live with multi-generational families. The residential infill project is one [STREET] to begin offering more affordable housing for multi-generational families without pricing them out of their own neighborhoods."
06_03_2020,affordable housing,"With discussions in our communities, their housing needs require a neighborhood design that allows for density and a pathway to truly affordable housing. We also want to uplift in adding components of the tenant opportunity to purchase and write a first refusal to ensure that struggling low-income renters can have a pathway towards a better life. In [ORGANIZATION], when low-income residents of [ORGANIZATION] were at risk for being priced out of their homes, we quickly organized with tenants who were...  largely Chinese immigrant families, to ensure they were not displaced."
06_03_2020,affordable housing,"If tenant opportunities to purchase and write our first refusal policies were in [STREET], we could have gone beyond preventing displacement and actually created a new asset for our community by creating long-term affordable housing. We ask that the [ORGANIZATION] supports a tenant-led initiative to develop a tenant opportunity to purchase policy. Everyone is worthy of a stable, healthy home."
06_03_2020,affordable housing,"I ask that you please support measures within [ORGANIZATION] that will create sustainable, affordable housing. Thank you for listening and your efforts to continue helping low-income Portlanders have opportunities to be the most vulnerable throughout the city. Thank you."
06_03_2020,homelessness,"Even with the vital adoption of [ORGANIZATION] 4 and 6, [ORGANIZATION] on its own is just one small step toward building a more just city, but it's a necessary step. We have big things to do in this city. Reigning in an out-of-control police force, building a climate-resilient city, providing stable housing to all people experiencing homelessness, preventing and repairing the displacement of communities of color and low-income communities."
06_03_2020,housing crisis; affordable housing,"Housing stability helps everyone mitigate uncertainty better and it allows us to create more resilient neighborhoods where families, low income renters and folks with mixed income can all live together. And I look forward, like I said before, this is only one step in order to address our affordable housing crisis, not that we're having just a housing crisis, we are having a crisis of affordability in our city and many cities across the country. the state"
06_03_2020,affordable housing,"A key reason that [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] have spent DATE0 high up in the national hunger rankings is that housing costs have risen so much faster than wages. The rapid rise of rental costs in the [ORGANIZATION] metro area and in other places in [PERSON] could be a driving force in the jump in food security, according to [PERSON] State sociology professor [PERSON]. This connection between housing and hunger is also demonstrated by a study from [ORGANIZATION]'s ORG2 that found that low-income families with affordable housing have more food security."
06_03_2020,affordable housing,"Adaptive reuse, on the other hand, of existing homes will reduce waste, preserve naturally occurring affordable housing, and help prevent displacement of lower income households. And an important part of this amendment is the extension of the demolition disincentive to contributing buildings within conservation districts. Many of these districts such as [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], and [PERSON] are historically black neighborhoods which contain cultural sites important to the history of African Americans in GPE4."
06_03_2020,affordable housing,"By voting no on [ORGANIZATION] and allowing affordable housing to remain standing and be reused. Remember, [ORGANIZATION] isn't about affordable housing. Look at the last item on that slide."
06_03_2020,affordable housing,This was presented near the beginning of the project. And it shows that affordable housing was not part of the scope of the project. We weren't even really allowed to discuss it at any of these open houses.
06_03_2020,affordable housing,So I'm surprised people are mentioning it. And I wish you had an air horn for every time it was intimated that [ORGANIZATION] would bring us affordable housing. What's worse is [ORGANIZATION] incentivizes the loss of affordable housing.
06_03_2020,affordable housing,"Maybe it was compelling  that the unlikely bed follows of 1000 friends, real estate investors and the home builders joined forces to advance their notion of how [ORGANIZATION], how [ORGANIZATION]ers should live, maybe, or maybe random density policies are a path to accelerated displacement of our most disadvantaged citizens, our most affordable housing, our most desired housing types, our adopted comprehensive planning goals for livability,  homeownership, stable neighborhoods, compatible infill, reduced automobile dependency and goals for resilience and sustainability. Leading to this point of final decisions, there has been no testing, an embarrassing lack of analysis, and no framework or standards for assessing the impact of these far-reaching policies. [LOCATION] [DATE] does not mandate density everywhere as in the [ORGANIZATION]."
06_03_2020,affordable housing,"I support the goals of [ORGANIZATION], but I'm disappointed that it didn't  takes a scattershot approach to density rather than focusing it along transit lines as recommended in the comprehensive plan. I confess to being influenced by the policies that [ORGANIZATION], where I lived for [ORGANIZATION], has taken where they focused density along transit and were successful in  a dramatic reduction in car trips, a boost in transit use, and they did create affordable housing as well. I am concerned that Amendment Number 6 would increase the incentive for developers to destroy existing homes, thereby wasting natural resources embodied in them."
07_22_2020,homelessness,"Their rent assistance and household assistance are using the following mission. Create an emergency rent assistance household assistance intervention to support [ORGANIZATION] households financially impacted by [ORGANIZATION] to prevent them from being evicted and falling into homelessness and to support the culturally specific organizations who effectively serve [ORGANIZATION] communities. And the guiding principles from [ORGANIZATION], which the council adopted, are the foundation of the process and have been."
07_22_2020,affordable housing,"And the intention for both [ORGANIZATION] is to support providers and networks that have rent assistance infrastructure and demonstrated outcomes in providing rent assistance and affordable housing to low-income [ORGANIZATION] households, as well as culturally specific communities. providers serving [ORGANIZATION] communities who are not included in the networks, but who directly serve [ORGANIZATION] households in need of rent assistance and household support. So I'm pleased that a lot of the money is being dedicated to that."
07_22_2020,homeless,"The housing bureau has been significantly engaged in allocating resources towards rent support and housing support. There's a significant increase,  level of support going to [ORGANIZATION] to make sure that the most vulnerable people on our streets get the resources they need. We had a spirited discussion about the question as to whether or not funding should go towards the digital divide."
07_22_2020,affordable housing,"Thankfully, [ORGANIZATION] and ORG1 are the kind of partners that have consistently shown up for that work, for those conversations, for finding solutions outside of the box and connecting people and resources. The [ORGANIZATION] local team especially has gone above and beyond a contract in the past in supporting ORG2 and forging new partnerships. They simultaneously nurture the many programs we throw at them, including a transportation wallet pilot program I led in affordable housing, which helped us sign up 100 by-town users in a sweep of transportation fares that connected residents to all of the transportation services around [ORGANIZATION]."
07_22_2020,affordable housing,"We're incredibly proud of the work of our community and partners both [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]  and all of the community partners we have on ORG1 and our affordable housing partners in getting us here. And we're really, really excited about something we've really wanted to do since we began this program, which is to expand into [ORGANIZATION] where we know the need for bicycle access and transportation access is great and to bring e-bikes, which is the fact that [ORGANIZATION] that we have e-bikes, they'll be available in significant parts of [ORGANIZATION]. It's something that we're really excited about."
07_22_2020,affordable housing,"The 48-unit residents who live upstairs only have 10 parking spots. The traffic is getting worse on FAC0 and FAC1. There are more residential apartments, affordable housing, and small business in [ORGANIZATION]."
07_22_2020,unhoused,"And no wonder the police are brutalizing people and arresting unhoused people. This is what they protect. And just like we were talking about earlier with these public-private partnerships, we are just giving away [STREET] too much."
07_22_2020,homelessness,"We have continued to show up and serve the public, especially for our most vulnerable neighbors. We expanded our free [ORGANIZATION] meal program, offered shelter for people experiencing homelessness, opened our restrooms [TIME] a day, and turned on drinking fountains early. I am proud of the work our team has done during this public health crisis."
07_22_2020,homeless; houseless,"We also provide a venue for neighborhood meetings, a community computer lab for job searches, and a no-cost shower for houseless or homeless people. Please don't focus on ability to pay or just the ability to pay. Often parents are unwilling to pay even though they have the money."
07_22_2020,affordable housing,"The non-conforming upgrades proposal, this extends the compliance period for non-conforming upgrades which are required for building permits for large alterations on sites with non-conforming development. So this would extend the agreements impacted until [ORGANIZATION]. The inclusionary housing rates proposal, there's currently a lower rate of affordable housing is required for inclusionary housing projects outside of the central city and gateway."
07_22_2020,affordable housing,"The inclusionary housing amendment, this would limit the extension of the lower affordable housing rates for inclusionary housing projects outside the central city and gateway. So that would be limited from [ORGANIZATION] to [LOCATION]. And finally, the [ORGANIZATION] amendment."
08_08_2018,affordable housing,"And lastly, what's great about the new CM1 zone in terms of design is that it comes with design standards. So there are new design standards under the CM1 zone that speak to neighborhood compatibility and design of the project, which is a good thing. insurance mechanism for the architect who spoke about design the scale is 1.5 to 1 so you can go a little higher than that if you build affordable housing but the base is 1.5 to 1 and then lastly there's a new community outreach requirement in CM1 zoning so that prior to submittal of building permits you're required now where usually you weren't to go to the neighborhood, review your proposal and then submit your building permit  Without all close."
08_08_2018,affordable housing,"I had a question also. So we heard testimony about the 35-foot height limit. If there were a mixed-use redevelopment that included affordable housing, is there a higher height limit it could be built to?"
07_13_2016,affordable housing,"Thank you. Actually, [ORGANIZATION], I would just like to make a pitch to climate activists to weigh in on land use type issues that affect  our own use of fossil fuels. Like [ORGANIZATION] we had a hearing on whether to adopt minimum parking regulations in [ORGANIZATION] requiring a certain amount of parking to be built with new buildings and the affordable housing activists were out in force saying that these minimums would lead to increased housing prices."
07_13_2016,homeless; housing crisis,"So I'm not as familiar with what is actually being done, boots on the ground,  to not just stop gang violence, but to help people who have a high risk of getting involved in gang violence switch paths to productive, satisfying lives. And I hope that any time we find surplus money in the budget, I know we have trouble balancing priorities because we have a homeless and housing crisis, but also to put city money into getting yourselves and student leaders from all the schools involved  meeting with people who, you know, we know that in our lives as adults, it happens just as much as with children, that there are cliques and polarizations. And those things also contribute to gang affiliation."
06_19_2019,affordable housing,"[PERSON], request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding a new revenue source to help fund affordable housing, education, and other pressing needs. Good morning. Name for the record, [TIME]."
06_19_2019,homelessness,"Good morning. [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] declared that our homelessness constituted an emergency. Since then, [ORGANIZATION] has acted-"
06_19_2019,homelessness,"I'm a concerned citizen of [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION], thank you. And anyway, [ORGANIZATION] declared a homelessness emergency in [ORGANIZATION]."
06_19_2019,affordable housing,"Thank you. 100,000 Portlanders pay more than 50% of their income for housing and may find themselves on the [STREET] during the next economic downturn. Therefore, it seems likely that despite these efforts, the affordable housing problem will only grow."
06_19_2019,homeless,"The ones that I am most thankful for is the ongoing funding for [ORGANIZATION] for the office that serves landlords and tenants. As we increase regulation, we need to support landlords and tenants in understanding our policies and their rights, as well as the complete count for the upcoming census."
06_19_2019,houseless,"In the short term, there is disappointment and sadness, and I will commit to being part of the conversation to look for that ongoing sustainable funding. The [ORGANIZATION] continues to invest in housing and houseless services. We continue to need the federal government to address those issues at the national level."
06_19_2019,homeless,"I'm encouraged to see the regional level and state level has finally come to the realization this is not just a [ORGANIZATION] problem. [PERSON] has made significant investments in housing, passing a $1.2 billion bond for housing, and yet their homeless population jumped 16% from 18 to 19. So there does need to be a massive national investment in housing, and unfortunately that doesn't look like it's going to happen."
06_19_2019,homeless,"In the meantime, the council, under Mayor [PERSON]'s leadership, is funding [ORGANIZATION] at the requested level. So thank you, Mayor [PERSON], for working with your colleagues to adopt this compromise budget. Commissioner [PERSON], thank you for bringing forward a responsible, even if painful, budget for parks that does put parks on a more sustainable path."
06_19_2019,homelessness,"But on the whole, I'm very proud of the work that we've collectively done for this budget for [ORGANIZATION]. The budget reflects a collective commitment to housing and addressing the homelessness crisis. Supporting equitable outcomes and fostering equitable prosperity so that as our economy continues to grow, Portlanders benefit regardless of who they are."
06_19_2019,homeless; homelessness,"Fiscal sustainability and intergenerational equity, clean and safe communities, and importantly in my opinion, improving and streamlining both city processes as well as constituent response. We invested in housing and homelessness. While we were certainly required to make some challenging budget decisions [ORGANIZATION], I'm very pleased that we were able to preserve and continue progress on critical and urgent housing and homeless needs."
06_19_2019,homeless; homelessness,This budget includes almost $10 million to continue critical services that otherwise would have been cut. And it adds new services in [ORGANIZATION] budget. I'm particularly pleased about our continued investments in homelessness services and the fact that this budget provides nearly $7 million in funding to continuing the current service levels through ORG1.
06_19_2019,homeless,"That's everything from prevention to shelter services, transitioning people out the [STREET] into housing, and providing services to help people be successful in that housing. This budget also invests in innovative new services, including $500,000 for drug and alcohol treatment services for those who are the most chronically homeless. It includes anti-displacement approaches."
06_19_2019,homeless,"It provides funding for a partnership in a new navigation center to make sure that chronically homeless people are connected to whatever services they need to get off and stay off the streets. I'm particularly excited about the inclusion of the new [ORGANIZATION]. This pilot provides mobile bathrooms and showers to ensure access to basic hygiene needs for those who are homeless, and the provision of low-barrier job training for individuals who want to work as station attendants."
06_19_2019,affordable housing,"For example, an [ORGANIZATION] grant from [ORGANIZATION] in supporting [PERSON]'s mission to reduce disparities in economic and education for Asian and [LOCATION] communities. The grant will equip [PERSON]'s community space in a new affordable housing development with technology for digital literacy training and broadband internet access for low-income residents. Affordable broadband has become more and more critical to our local public institutions."
06_19_2019,homeless,"Thank you. [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]. Okay."
06_19_2019,affordable housing,"While the uses historically in a lot of the public art we have have been great, they haven't been shared wide. And we continue to hear from artists that space is the top priority, that space is quickly going away. So any opportunity where we could add an additional room for activities in an affordable housing project or add... a room onto a new fire station."
06_19_2019,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] is [ORGANIZATION] at [ORGANIZATION], overseeing ground up and adaptive reuse projects for [ORGANIZATION]. Including commercial office developments and hospitality from sourcing all the [STREET] to completion. Ms. [PERSON] served as development manager for affordable housing projects utilizing low income housing tax credits."
06_19_2019,homeless,"And thank you very much for this opportunity as a community member in [ORGANIZATION] and having worked on some of the homeless issues with [ORGANIZATION] and now representing ORG1. I'm very excited to be a part of this and look forward to working with you all. Thanks, [ORGANIZATION]."
06_19_2019,housing crisis,"I have witnessed the pitfalls of unsustainable homeownership during the recent housing crisis. I believe this could have been ameliorated through effective and risk-related home purchasing and home retention education programs. I look forward in participating in discussions on new ways to improve the quality of life that homeownership can be increased, sustained, as well as exploring and strengthening current and new affordable home buying options."
06_19_2019,homeless,"PERSON0. So I have a just a brief comment and then a kind of a charge. DATE0 [TIME] I had breakfast in [ORGANIZATION] with someone who is arguably the architect of the city's response to the homeless crisis and we talked a little bit about The differences between [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION], we talked a little bit about what was working and what wasn't working in terms of strategies."
06_19_2019,homelessness,"Commissioner [ORGANIZATION] noted that in the most recent [STREET] count, [ORGANIZATION] saw a 16% increase in homelessness. Yet, among other things, they passed a $1.2 billion ballot measure to fund supportive housing and They are housing people at the rate of 1,700 a month. Director [PERSON] would kill to have the kinds of resources to be able to find 1,700 homes [LOCATION] for people in distress."
06_19_2019,homelessness,"So the point of my story is that every city up and down [ORGANIZATION] is experiencing a crisis. I believe that because of our size, because of the nature of the partnerships, And because of the plan, which particularly [ORGANIZATION] is charged with implementing on homelessness, I believe we're going to see progress over time. But it's going to take time."
06_19_2019,homelessness; affordable housing,"So you are coming into service at a particularly sensitive time. Your charge will be more focused, frankly, on... affordable housing than homelessness because of the [STREET] we've defined up responsibilities. But it is really important that we get as much of the bond money and other resources out the door as quickly as possible."
06_19_2019,affordable housing,"I'm really excited reading your bios about the expertise you're going to bring. And, [ORGANIZATION], I'm particularly interested in a your ability to help in the conversation around inclusionary zoning and affordable housing and helping developers figure out how to make it pencil out. Because I hear that a lot and having never bought a home or developed a property, I can't really aid them in that endeavor."
06_19_2019,affordable housing,PERSON0. You are going to be in the center of the storm of all of the challenges that we face as a community in providing affordable housing and housing in general. So thank you very much for your willingness to serve.
06_19_2019,homelessness,"The mission of [ORGANIZATION] is to advise the director of [ORGANIZATION], the housing commissioner, and ORG2 on housing and homelessness policy, strategy and resource issues, promote improvements within [ORGANIZATION] and the larger housing system, highlight opportunities for influence between the city housing system and other systems, As well as provide a forum for public input on housing and homelessness issues. So I agree with Commissioner [PERSON] that to some degree while there are amazing people serving on [ORGANIZATION], it has felt a little bit like a Ferrari parked in the garage and occasionally trotted out to run to the grocery store. We have a really solid group of people on this commission and The issue that you will be working on, the issues that are all interrelated that you will be working on, are right now the most important issues in the city of [ORGANIZATION]."
06_19_2019,homeless,"Please, Mayor, more than 38, okay? Because there's a lot of vets out there. They're homeless."
06_19_2019,affordable housing,"The action plan, this is actually our fourth [ORGANIZATION] plan for the DATE1 consolidated plan. It details the consortium's strategies for addressing the community's needs for affordable housing and economic development with federal funding. The action plan shows where the city has invested."
06_19_2019,affordable housing,"Next item, and this is our last non-second reading, this is item 607. Authorize 14 subrecipient contracts for $4,448,250 for services in support of providing affordable housing. Welcome back."
06_19_2019,houseless,"There are many examples of communities of color enduring a disproportionate level of scrutiny when compared with white Americans engaged in the same kinds of social activist activities. Undocumented immigrants, day laborers, the houseless community, and those with criminal convictions suffer from data extreme. Living beyond the reach of the data collection systems needed to thrive in society, they gain so much privacy that they become increasingly invisible."
06_19_2019,homelessness; affordable housing,"In my role as a policymaker, constructive criticism is welcome if it leads to better policy. But I reject the efforts by some in this debate to mischaracterize the law and to target and demonize classes of people like those exiting the criminal justice system who clearly deserve a second chance. During my service, we have made big investments in combating homelessness and increasing the supply of affordable housing."
06_19_2019,housing crisis; affordable housing,And they cannot even afford the average rent for a room in a shared house. We are experiencing a national housing crisis driven by our federal government's divestment in affordable housing. By state and local governments who have failed to meet the growing need for affordable housing.
06_19_2019,homelessness,"We know that half of the renters in [ORGANIZATION] are cost burdened by housing expenses. We know that housing discrimination, both intentional and unintentional, is still prevalent. We know there's an overwhelming correlation between affordability and homelessness."
06_19_2019,housing crisis,"But something we can achieve much more rapidly is protecting and stabilizing tenants and decreasing barriers to securing housing, which is critical to our overall housing strategy. This policy package is a significant contribution to that effort. I think I've talked enough about our housing crisis, our failures, and the devastating outcomes of this crisis over the course of the three public hearings this item has had."
06_19_2019,affordable housing,"PERSON0 clywed [PERSON], PERSON3, PERSON4 cyfeirio'r PERSON5 ffyrddol, [ORGANIZATION] yn dod ato i'w PERSON8 hwynebu ar y marchn. PERSON9 PERSON10 a duplexau PERSON11 I've heard testimony from a developer who's put an affordable housing project on hold here in [ORGANIZATION] and is planning instead to develop in [ORGANIZATION]."
06_19_2019,affordable housing,"I'm concerned that the actions the city and state have taken collectively will have an adverse impact on the supply of affordable housing. I expect that those landlords who do choose to keep their rental properties will increase rent significantly on vacant units, pricing out those very people we are trying to help with our actions. What this means is the population we intend and need to support the most, communities of colour and lower income renters, will not be better off as a result."
06_19_2019,affordable housing,"I also want you to know that I've weighed out the requested changes to determine how our housing operators, owners, and management companies would implement these policies. And I've asked hard questions of Commissioner [PERSON] and her team about potential unintended consequences from this policy that would contribute to our city's biggest housing issue, which is the availability of affordable housing supply. We also have to acknowledge that as of this moment, there is no ongoing budget associated with the implementation of these policies."
06_19_2019,affordable housing,"The council's going to have to engage in some very difficult conversations going forward about funding priorities, and I want to again state that My belief, in fact, I'll just say this is a fact. I will not support the funding of these proposals coming at the expense either of the public safety or from affordable housing production. So we will have to find alternative means to fund these proposals."
06_19_2019,affordable housing,"I appreciate the fact that you slowed down to give me the time to process how these potential policies could impact. the affordable housing market in our community. And I appreciate your graciousness in accepting both the revisions that were proposed, as well as supporting many of the amendments that I put on the table."
06_19_2019,affordable housing,"The security deposit rules also add huge administrative burdens for both owners and renters. A reputable housing provider, affordable housing providers told me there are multiple issues concerning the practical application of this policy. For instance, there's lack of clarity on who bears the burden of repair costs."
07_10_2019,affordable housing,"649, authorize the purchase of certain real property located at [ADDRESS] for affordable housing not to exceed $6.8 million plus closing costs. Colleagues, the city is pleased to see the land under discussion being preserved for future affordable housing, particularly in a neighborhood that's been historically impacted by displacement. I think we all understand that land is an increasing premium in [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]east [ORGANIZATION], and this acquisition contributes to the goals of the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]east Neighborhood Housing Strategy, and importantly it responds to the stated community priority of creating a land bank for the future before properties like this one are eventually lost to the pressures of the market."
07_10_2019,affordable housing,"And I would really just like to – Thank and acknowledge the [ORGANIZATION] family for working with us for, I think it's been [ORGANIZATION] of discussions with [ORGANIZATION]. Active discussions in trying to make sure that this property remained a community asset and contains affordable housing for generations to come. So I appreciate the willingness to work with us and talk with us."
07_10_2019,affordable housing,Mayor. Commissioner [PERSON]. I want to echo Commissioner [PERSON]'s statement and just say or note how vital it is that we move as much property out of the private market as we can and turn it into permanently affordable housing.
07_10_2019,homeless,And they do so through a contract. And then they just fire them. And then they can't pay their rent and they're homeless.
07_10_2019,affordable housing,We are not going to solve our long term affordable housing problem unless we build a lot more affordable housing. And this is a terrific location and I'm pleased that we'll be doing the land banking now and then figuring out how to maximize the use. I'm a big believer that the name of the property should reflect the history.
07_10_2019,homeless,"Those are the kinds of numbers that matter to citizens because they're the only [STREET] we can assess whether or not this is a useful project or not. And, you know... We could come up with a limited number of these projects and say we're doing great things no matter what we do, but how is this impacting the overall number of homeless people that we need?"
07_10_2019,affordable housing,"Furthering what the gentleman in the green just said about the total amount of money for affordable housing, the total amount of money being spent for shelters, the total amount of money being spent for permanent supportive housing, I can tell you right now the shelters are inhumane. I'm in a [ORGANIZATION] shelter on the east side. This has nothing to do with the matter for us."
07_10_2019,affordable housing,"This is the kind of population we're talking about. When you say affordable housing, you're talking about housing people who are going to make money. $15 an hour, who are ambulatory, who are only economically marginalized, who are not disabled, who don't have a-"
07_10_2019,homelessness; affordable housing,Your time's been stopped and I'm speaking now. This is one piece of our overall strategy to address affordable housing and homelessness. It has nothing to do with shelters.
07_10_2019,affordable housing,"Which is, are you for it or against it? And if so, why? Okay, there's not enough affordable housing and there's not enough permanent supportive housing and we need to abolish shelters."
07_10_2019,affordable housing,"So more of the same for affordable housing because when you have these government contractors come in, they hire these temporary workers and then they lay them off over and over again and they can't pay their rent anymore. PERSON0, I'm sorry. I'm going to have to move on."
07_10_2019,affordable housing,"These 75 total units respond to the great need for affordable housing options in [ORGANIZATION] and further our commitment to the [ORGANIZATION] community as well as taking meaningful steps to both prevent and mitigate displacement. Right up front, I want to thank the good folks at [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and the [PERSON] community at large for their excellent participation and collaboration on this project. Director [PERSON]."
07_10_2019,affordable housing,"52 units of affordable housing are being supported by [ORGANIZATION]. 45 of these units will be available to families who make less than 60% of median income. That means a two-person household, for example, who makes approximately $42,000 a year."
07_10_2019,affordable housing,"I certainly wouldn't want us to be supporting the creation of poor floors or poor entrances, to use some really negative terminology. But what are the... complexities you're referring to? So the affordable housing is supported, as you know, by low-income housing tax credits."
07_10_2019,homelessness,"Our mission is to counter the forces that give rise to homelessness and poverty. We do that work primarily in [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], and we've been doing it for [ORGANIZATION]. Thank you."
07_10_2019,affordable housing,"I approach affordable housing a little differently than some because what I have come to appreciate is that they are almost impossible projects to pencil out and to do. People say, why does it take time? Why do you need a girding needling?"
07_10_2019,affordable housing,"And then the complexity of how you do tax credits and we have made the development of affordable housing in this country inordinately complicated. And when you bring tax credits into the equation, a market-based system, you've got to bring lawyers and accountants and all kinds of people. So I operate from the assumption that it is almost impossible to do these projects correctly."
07_10_2019,affordable housing,"So similar to affordable housing where there is some rent that is anticipated to service the financing, we are anticipating some rents coming from the lease process. the leases to repay the financing, but there is a portion that is permanently subsidized and allows us to keep those rents at affordable levels. Because I thank you for that response."
07_10_2019,affordable housing,So I don't have any concerns on this. One of the things I guess that I was kind of wondering here is that this is [ORGANIZATION] financing and I was wondering on these other projects we've kind of seen [ORGANIZATION] is that does the affordable housing bond come into play on any of these projects or they could possibly is that correct?
07_10_2019,affordable housing,"So because I haven't heard anything on the affordable housing bond and the money sitting there to maybe be used on these type of projects. So maybe someone could explain that to me on this because I understand is the [ORGANIZATION] financing. And but other than that, like I say, I really like the project and."
07_10_2019,affordable housing,"I like the idea of having market rate and low income affordable housing units interconnected in a [STREET] that is seamless. And this is going to be one of those great projects. And I'm thrilled to vote aye, even though I wished, again, that we had, like, a lot more."
07_10_2019,houseless,"Is there a role for [ORGANIZATION] to play with [PERSON] as it supports the houseless population which is so heavily targeted by hate? As we expand into policy and campaign work, our training has moved beyond individual skill building and empowerment to institutional policy making. For example, I recently trained ORG2 in interrupting hate in public spaces, not just so staff can feel personally empowered, but so they can establish policies and protocols to empower the collective to deploy someone to center the target, somebody to de-escalate the perpetrator, and then to follow through on whatever happened after the incident takes [STREET]."
07_10_2019,homeless,"We owe it to [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON], active bystanders killed on the [ORGANIZATION]. We owe it to [ORGANIZATION], a DATE0 black homeless trans woman found hanging from a tree [LOCATION]. We owe it to those civil rights activists who were assaulted DATE2 on the streets of [ORGANIZATION]."
07_10_2019,homeless,Item 672. Item 672. amend [ORGANIZATION] with [LOCATION] to authorize [ORGANIZATION] budget allocation to [ORGANIZATION].
07_10_2019,homeless,"Very good. And we have [ORGANIZATION], the [ORGANIZATION] Director, and PERSON1 from ORG1. Good [TIME]."
07_10_2019,homeless,"This is [ORGANIZATION] that we have made an amendment to the [ORGANIZATION], we are making an amendment to reflect and effectuate the budget that council approved in [LOCATION]. So essentially what we're doing is making sure that we can freely flow money between [ORGANIZATION], the city, and [PERSON]. So with that, I would see if [ORGANIZATION] wanted to say anything."
07_10_2019,homeless; homelessness,"I feel that homelessness is... a very, very serious issue. I was homeless for [ORGANIZATION] due to displacement. And so to see advocacy by the city to combat that is very, very much important."
07_10_2019,affordable housing,"This is similarly to the joint office [ORGANIZATION], which you just voted on, an intergovernmental agreement that effectuates the transfer of funds between ORG1 and ORG2. Primarily, we are a recipient from ORG2 of the transfer of funds. of TIF dollars for affordable housing development, and then we also transfer some of our federal dollars, namely CDBG, for workforce development efforts at ORG2."
07_10_2019,affordable housing,"One other point if I just make for my colleagues, the developer does plan to build housing at this site and this will be an inclusionary housing project. So we will be getting some affordable housing in a very important part of our city. PERSON0, do you have anything to add?"
07_10_2019,homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION] has partnered with [ORGANIZATION] to conduct and release this survey DATE0 for [LOCATION] as a service to the community in conjunction with our DATE2 Value of Jobs economic checkup. The clear takeaway from the [ORGANIZATION] survey is that issues impacting our region's livability are far and away the top priority. [PERSON], the cost of housing, and increasing traffic congestion were the only issues that registered in the double digits."
07_10_2019,homelessness,"And while a majority of voters felt that the city and the region were on the right Nearly two-thirds of voters said the region's livability is getting worse. In follow-up questions, nearly all survey respondents cited homelessness, housing, or traffic congestion as the reason they felt livability was declining. The survey of the entire community aligns with the results of surveys we have conducted of [ORGANIZATION]'s approximately 1,900 members."
06_24_2020,affordable housing,"And they have specific objectives and constraints. [ORGANIZATION] is our most flexible source of funding, and you can see [ORGANIZATION] we received over eight million dollars in new funds. The HOME program has the objective to expand the supply of decent, safe, and sanitary affordable housing."
06_24_2020,homelessness,"And as a part of our over $4 million allocation [ORGANIZATION], a portion of that is transferred through a jurisdictional transfer to [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]. And then our emergency solutions grant, over $700,000 [ORGANIZATION], the goal there is to reduce and prevent homelessness. And our [ORGANIZATION] grant for housing opportunities for persons with AIDS, almost $2 million, that's shared with the counties throughout the region."
06_24_2020,homeless,"And the purpose is to provide housing for persons with AIDS, and we do this as a regional partnership. And there's also an agency transfer of the [ORGANIZATION] and the ORG1 funds with ORG2. So as part of the [ORGANIZATION] consolidated planning process, there were three established goals."
06_24_2020,homelessness; affordable housing,"First, to increase and preserve affordable housing choice. Second, to reduce and prevent homelessness. And then third, to improve employment and household economic stability."
06_24_2020,homelessness; affordable housing,"And you'll see in the following slides where those resources, where the priorities were made. Most of it is with affordable housing followed by preventing homelessness and then lastly improving employment for households and improving economic stability. And you can see there a list of the types of programs that we have supported historically."
06_24_2020,homelessness; affordable housing,"And [ORGANIZATION] is specific to housing for persons with AIDS, and then the Emergency Solutions Grant is specific to homelessness prevention. And when we break this down by the funding type, you can see home is [ORGANIZATION] is being spent mostly on new affordable housing. But also we have a significant carryover, about $4.5 million that will be spent on emergency rent assistance."
06_24_2020,homeless,"And then there is an agency transfer to [ORGANIZATION] for the microenterprise, the adult workforce, and the youth workforce development. And as I said earlier, the ORG1 and the ORG2 funds go through an agency transfer to [PERSON]. So the other part of this legislative action is to amend the citizen participation plan."
06_24_2020,homelessness,"While this particular legislation does not contain any CARES Act funding, the supplemental federal funds associated with the CARES Act, namely the CDBG, the [ORGANIZATION], and [ORGANIZATION],  will be used for [ORGANIZATION] rent assistance and business assistance as it pertains to, and homelessness assistance as it pertains to public health types of strategies. So that concludes my presentation. So I want to let you know that the public comment period for all the consortium members is through [ORGANIZATION], and I'll take any questions you may have."
09_12_2018,housing crisis,The second focuses on two programs managed by [ORGANIZATION]  to prevent sewer and storm water from damaging property or ending up in our waterways. And the third is an assessment of the city's regulation of the short-term rental market and its effect on the housing crisis. And we'll begin with the police training follow-up.
09_12_2018,affordable housing,These are also neighborhoods that have experienced historically gentrification and are facing affordable housing shortages. These neighborhoods should be monitored to determine how this market actually affects them. Data also shows that there are hosts with multiple short-term rentals.
09_12_2018,homelessness,"And you need to step up and start doing that because this can get out of control very fast and literally create homelessness. And we can decrease homelessness if we have the proper data provided. Now, issue number two on police training, I want more training on de-escalation."
09_12_2018,affordable housing,"And there will be more senior living next to the park and affordable housing next to the park, which is also going to enliven the community. So thank you all for coming down here. I move approval of the recommendation of the, I move approval of the hearings officer's report."
08_22_2018,homelessness,That the police wouldn't respond to. And you know I've been down here and told you the face of homelessness is a woman with a black eye and a bloody nose. And I'd see it up front.
08_22_2018,homeless,And I wanted you to see it too. But you never did. So you don't know what you're talking about when it comes to homeless.
08_22_2018,homeless; houseless,"Anybody feel free to take over. The evidence is right here with you. Item 878, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel regarding courage of the houseless, homeless community and hashtag abolish [ORGANIZATION], demonstrator protesters and hashtag ORG1 solidarity."
08_22_2018,affordable housing,"But right now, we all know that working families in the city of [ORGANIZATION] are struggling to have affordable housing, to make ends meet. Their health care benefits are under attack, and they're being attacked at the national level when it comes to their rights to collectively bargain and form a union at their job. We're seeing those things erode."
08_22_2018,housing insecurity,88% of our students report that they received free or reduced lunch in high school. And one in four report that they're currently experiencing food insecurity. And one in six report that they're currently experiencing housing insecurity.
08_22_2018,housing insecurity,"These students are also all coming from alternative programs in the greater [ORGANIZATION] area, including [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], et cetera,  as well as students who have been in foster care, have experienced housing insecurity, or have been adjudicated. These students have additional barriers, and I'm very excited to continue supporting them as they begin this incredible college experience. Now I'd like to introduce you to [ORGANIZATION], a ORG2 and ORG3 graduate who is about to begin his studies at [ORGANIZATION] State in [ORGANIZATION]."
08_22_2018,houseless,"These are the people who are supposed to protect and serve us. And they're antagonizing and harming the houseless. These people don't have a voice, and it's not fair for that to continue happening."
08_22_2018,houseless,"No, there are protocols, and I can get those to Ms. [PERSON]. If you can leave your contact information. So there's no legal places for people to sleep, like the houseless?"
08_22_2018,affordable housing,"Next item, 897. Designate and assign the FAC0 property from [ORGANIZATION] to ORG1 for development as affordable housing. Commissioner [PERSON]."
08_22_2018,homeless,"I understand there's homeless everywhere. But there's a drug epidemic, and what my concern is if they sell this land, I want to make sure that it is maintained by [ORGANIZATION] just like it has been [ORGANIZATION], that the grasses will be cut, that there will be security around, and that we can have a little more insight into [ORGANIZATION], which is growing, burgeoning, and on the possibility of being one of the most robust communities around as long as we feed it. I'm here [ORGANIZATION]."
08_22_2018,affordable housing,"However, the decision has been made by the council that it be housing, an affordable housing, and we want to thank [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] on what they've tried to do, and we look forward to cooperating and working with them to make this a,  really model facility development. What we are concerned and we're thankful that we'll have a representation on that. We hope that the council does direct them to make sure that they include us and other members of the community because there are many other members besides just ORG1."
08_22_2018,housing crisis; affordable housing,"This is a really important example of how  we can leverage publicly owned land to concretely address the affordable housing crisis we face in the city. And I think...  This could be a step, I think Commissioner [PERSON] used an important word, that this could actually trigger more transfers just like this. This site in particular is located in the heart of a very vibrant community."
08_22_2018,homelessness; housing crisis,"And I really believe that that's our housing crisis, and it's one of the key factors  contributors to our homelessness crisis, to our hunger crisis, to our equity crisis. [ORGANIZATION] from [ORGANIZATION] built about 110 houses in [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]east [LOCATION]. These homes were sold to households with an average income of 40% of the median income, and over 80% of them were households of color."
08_22_2018,housing crisis,"I mean, [ORGANIZATION]'s not going to live here forever. [ORGANIZATION]'s not going to live forever. But [ORGANIZATION] number one guy should come here and...  all the [ORGANIZATION] all the habitat humanity homes I'm familiar with were standalone single-family housing but it was great to hear that townhomes were mentioned because at the level of housing crisis we have at 60 MFI 40 and zero we also need density we can't just build beautiful suburbs for a very elite screened few of especially qualified income participants we need to think about density on this three acres so that we can have  not just quality of life impact, but get as many people as qualified applicants we can find into this great opportunity."
08_22_2018,affordable housing,"An emergency exists due to the fact that [ORGANIZATION]'s continued population and economic growth have had a significant impact on rental housing, resulting in a more than 30% increase in average rents from [ORGANIZATION] and consistently low vacancy rates between 1.7% and 3.3% from [LOCATION]. So,  Manufactured dwelling parks play a small but important part in providing affordable housing, and the incentives to promote this housing type should be available immediately. My co-sponsors, Commissioners [PERSON] and [PERSON], would like to make a few comments."
08_22_2018,affordable housing,"This is one of the most important forms of naturally occurring affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]. Some of the most vulnerable communities in [ORGANIZATION] live there, and it's important that we respect and provide assistance for vulnerable and underrepresented communities. I believe this change carries forward the [ORGANIZATION]'s intent to provide incentives and options for making the parks financially viable for owners, thus allowing residents to stay there."
08_22_2018,affordable housing,"So it basically creates two transfer markets, one inside the central city and one outside the central city. So there's a wider market where this underutilized density can be transferred to. At the same time, we are creating an affordable housing bonus."
08_22_2018,homelessness,"My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I am here on behalf of [ORGANIZATION], a nonprofit organization that helps Portlanders transition from homelessness to stably housed. [ORGANIZATION] strongly encourages you to adopt ORG1. For [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] has been working to ensure that everyone in our community has a home."
08_22_2018,homelessness; affordable housing,"DATE0 we help 15 to 20 Portlanders exit homelessness for stable housing. Our biggest obstacle remains our city's critical shortage of affordable housing, particularly units that are affordable to people exiting homelessness or vulnerable to falling into homelessness. [PERSON] is a symptom."
08_22_2018,affordable housing,"The underlying illness is our affordable housing shortage. And the only true remedy is to preserve existing affordable housing and create new units, especially for low-income households. That is precisely what [ORGANIZATION] will do."
08_22_2018,homeless; homelessness,"Manufactured homes are among the most affordable, low-barrier units in [ORGANIZATION]'s housing inventory. [ORGANIZATION] has successfully housed formerly homeless clients and manufactured homes, many of whom would still be experiencing homelessness [ORGANIZATION], but for the availability and accessibility of manufactured homes. Manufactured housing parks are the only housing option available for many people who are transitioning out of homelessness."
08_22_2018,homeless; affordable housing,"Manufactured housing parks are also the housing of last resort for people who would end up homeless if the parks are shut down. For many of the 3,000 households, there really may be no other [STREET] to go. We need to create more affordable housing, not eliminate 56 affordable, livable communities."
08_22_2018,homelessness,"DATE0, you have the ability to preserve 3,000 truly affordable, low-barrier housing units in resilient, hardworking communities across our city. Voting yes will ensure that 3,000 households will not be at imminent risk of homelessness. We applaud Mayor [PERSON] and Commissioners [PERSON] and PERSON2 for introducing this measure, all the staff who contributed to the project, and we strongly encourage you to adopt [ORGANIZATION]."
08_22_2018,housing crisis; affordable housing,"And thank you for taking up the proposed new zoning regulation, a designation, pardon me, as part of your continued focus on combating [ORGANIZATION]'s affordable housing crisis. [ORGANIZATION] is an independent, nonprofit organization serving [PERSON]'s five largest utilities.  and helping those customers save energy and generate clean energy. This includes the customers of [ORGANIZATION] General Electric, ORG2, and ORG3 within the city of [ORGANIZATION]."
08_22_2018,affordable housing,"I've submitted written comments into the record, and to each of you, hopefully you've had an opportunity to read those, and I obviously am not going to be able to get through all those points in [TIME], but I do want to touch on a couple things. First of all, I just want to acknowledge the fact that my client and I understand that there's a legitimate purpose, intent behind this and a concern about affordable housing. That's without debate."
08_22_2018,housing crisis,"These communities are unique in many ways. Each is like a family, but we are the poor, the elderly, the mentally ill, and the disabled. You, by passage of this law, have a chance to get ahead of the housing crisis sweeping through our city."
08_22_2018,housing crisis,"If you act boldly [ORGANIZATION] and pass this in the law, it is morally the right thing to do with this housing crisis. They asked for a volunteer to do this. Here I am."
08_22_2018,homeless,And there's a lot of us that would be homeless and by my personal experience I can tell you that it's very difficult and very sad cuando no puedes darle [ORGANIZATION] techo seguro a tu familia when you cannot give your family a safe home. PERSON0. Thank you.
08_22_2018,affordable housing; housing insecurity,"As you all know, housing insecurity is touching everyone in our city and we don't have the rental stock needed. The biggest opportunity for folks who need affordable housing is the opportunity to live within their communities and to preserve their existing homes. We have a vulnerable supply right now in our region and only a small fraction of affordable homes remain for families and communities of color."
08_22_2018,affordable housing,"A study showed that in the largest 100 metro regions, mobile home residents spend on average 40% less on housing costs than those living in non-mobile homes in the same metro area. As residents are hard-pressed to find alternative housing at similar costs, mobile homes provide a solution for our affordable housing shortage, which is why we need this zone change in order to sustain all mobile home parks that will continue to serve future generations. Manufactured housing is an essential, unique part of the affordable housing continuum and must be preserved."
08_22_2018,housing crisis,"They are a platform for success, and the parks provide community gathering for residents. Thank you. [ORGANIZATION] believes that [ORGANIZATION] needs to address all the required tools to solve the housing crisis, and I urge you to advance the proposal on mobile home zoning change."
08_22_2018,affordable housing,"Thank you. most lost access to affordable housing. Only 8% were able to move their homes to a new location at a [ORGANIZATION] cost of $20,000 to $30,000 per home."
08_22_2018,affordable housing,Thank you. building wealth and building empowerment for the residents of those communities. Manufactured housing is the largest supply of affordable housing in the country.
08_22_2018,affordable housing,So...  We really urge you to go ahead and approve this. We applaud you for bringing it up. It is a very important piece of our affordable housing inventory in [ORGANIZATION].
08_22_2018,affordable housing,"Among other things, qualifying to make or show a [ORGANIZATION] 49 claim is more challenging than was described earlier, but nonetheless, this ordinance has built into it ways in which the value of these mobile home parks will increase to the mobile home park landowners through increased densities, transfer development credits, density bonuses for affordable housing, that sort of thing. Thank you. But just as importantly, if a mobile home park landowner was able to establish a grounds for compensation under the [ORGANIZATION] 49 statute, the city has the ability to, quote, authorize the claimant, the landowner, to use the property without application of a land use regulation."
08_22_2018,affordable housing,"And I think if we start putting profits over people, it's not going to end well. You've already had a huge influx from [ORGANIZATION], and you're going to have another, and you're going to have one from [PERSON] and maybe GPE2. This is not affordable housing."
08_22_2018,affordable housing,"And this is democracy in action, so you got to see how we operate. And your presence here was greatly appreciated. We're taking up a proposal [ORGANIZATION] to broaden the incentives for affordable housing."
08_22_2018,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], as you heard, has 57 manufactured dwelling parks citywide, providing affordable housing for nearly 3,000 households. And the vote we're taking here [ORGANIZATION], because I can count the votes, it honors the intent of the comprehensive plan through this action. And it also increases the diversity of affordable housing options that are available in this city."
07_15_2020,homeless,"I believe that we will pull through this crisis as a city by working together. The proposal represents our shared values and these investments will help keep Portlanders housed, [ORGANIZATION], and employed through the worst of the crisis. We're focusing on providing direct relief to those who are the most impacted and most vulnerable to the impacts of the pandemic, prioritizing [ORGANIZATION] communities and individuals that identify as disabled, elderly, or homeless."
07_15_2020,homeless,"These expenses include everything from cleaning supplies, disinfecting supplies, [ORGANIZATION] for our first responders, and staff time redeployed to the emergency coordination center. The allocations for [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] cities assist our jurisdictional partners with mitigating public health response related expenses. The 19.1 to homeless response will fund both city county [PERSON] related homeless services, as well as some city only pilot projects like outdoor shelters and tiny home programs."
07_15_2020,homeless,"About $16.5 million. I'm trying to get to the first time I had an update, somebody said that that decision was made. And I'm trying to figure out who decided that $19.1 million would go to homeless responses."
07_15_2020,homeless,"Okay. Oh yeah, it's part of our city county cost sharing agreement for [ORGANIZATION]. And so they developed a budget, which was, I think, and [ORGANIZATION] is on the line if you want to interject, but they developed a budget as part of our homeless response."
07_15_2020,housing crisis,"Thank you, [ORGANIZATION]. So I just want to acknowledge once again, this will not remotely cover the need. I'm deeply concerned about the coming housing crisis if the state and federal government doesn't take  swift and dramatic action."
07_15_2020,affordable housing,"And this isn't really the time for the conversation, but I think that we need to talk about providing eviction defense moving forward because we are going to see a wave of thousands of evictions without some significant change. And [ORGANIZATION], one more question. I understand you said that  The city cannot use these funds to reimburse ourselves for lost rent revenue, but other affordable housing providers aren't precluded, are they?  Commissioner, this is [ORGANIZATION] again."
07_15_2020,affordable housing,"what we are planning on doing is actually using that allocation of resources for the affordable housing providers that we have regulated agreements with to apply for their tenants on a building-wide scale and we would prioritize those resources for the affordable housing developments that have the highest percentage of [ORGANIZATION] community members. We know  at least in terms of most of our buildings, the race and ethnicity of the heads of household. So we would on a rolling basis, have folks have building owners apply on behalf of their tenants for tenant based rent for those funding for that funds and use those funds until they're exhausted."
07_15_2020,affordable housing,"Well, goodness, I don't know if I know the last sentence I just said. So we have $4.5 million in home funds. And what we will be doing is asking our affordable housing owners to apply for rent assistance on a building-wide basis."
07_15_2020,affordable housing,"And okay, I think I got that. So we're trying to catch folks up on their rent on a whole building-wide basis for affordable housing portfolio. Okay."
07_15_2020,homelessness,"Our public health team has worked tirelessly to expand contact tracing and case investigation,  They've stood up no-cost community testing sites for people experiencing symptoms, and they've provided the public with timely, accurate information to help our community understand this crisis and what is required of all of us to make progress. And they've done it all with a focus on equity, accessibility, and representation. This funding also represents a significant investment in protecting people experiencing homelessness from [ORGANIZATION]."
07_15_2020,homeless; homelessness,"Through the ORG0 ORG1, we will ensure that the people in our shelters who are most vulnerable to this disease will be able to self-isolate, while at the same time continuing to allow for physical distancing at all of our shelters. So far, 18 people who've reported experiencing homelessness in [ORGANIZATION] have tested positive for [PERSON]. That's out of over 3,000 confirmed cases in [ORGANIZATION]."
07_15_2020,homeless; homelessness,"So we have to continue being diligent and protecting the people we serve because when you're homeless, you are that much more at risk of the severe consequences associated with this disease. And that is one of the many reasons why we need to make sure that we are doing all we can to prevent more households from falling into homelessness during this crisis. The eviction moratorium, which we spearheaded together with the mayor's office back in [ORGANIZATION], is now state law, providing vital stability for renters across the state for [LOCATION]."
07_15_2020,homeless,"We really appreciate the advice and the counsel that we've been receiving through the  The health professionals and the folks in [ORGANIZATION] of [ORGANIZATION], that's been critically important to our efforts here. And we're very grateful for the longstanding partnership we have around addressing vulnerable populations, including those who are homeless on our streets. And I want to thank you personally for your leadership."
07_15_2020,houseless,"And I want to also add my thanks to you, [PERSON], and your entire board for being really strong partners, as the Mayor said from the very beginning. My question is about the joint office and whether or not this $19 million will add any additional beds for folks who are houseless. It is my understanding that this $19 million is to protect the folks who are currently in our shelter system who are very very vulnerable to contracting the disease and then being hospitalized hospitalized So by putting them in their own individual spaces"
07_15_2020,houseless,And because we will have a lot more houseless people when this is over. So thank you. I appreciate that.
07_15_2020,houseless,I appreciate the conversation. I would just note that we know that the most cost-effective [STREET] of reducing houselessness is to prevent people from becoming houseless in the first [STREET]. And so we need to make sure that the people who are currently hanging onto their housing by a thread remain in that housing.
07_15_2020,homelessness,"And when we were formed, our goal was really to leverage the political and social capital of those businesses to support the community more broadly in our work on housing and homelessness, transportation policy, and economic development. We, of course, never could have foreseen the situation that we find ourselves in [ORGANIZATION] where we're actually supporting our members directly by advocating for their needs, primarily at the state and federal level. I just want to say how much we appreciate the leadership of [ORGANIZATION] and the mayor and Commissioner [PERSON] in all of the economic recovery calls that we've participated in.  really heartening to participate in those and to see the genuine commitment to equity and the approach that was taken from the very, very beginning of that economic recovery task force."
07_15_2020,homelessness,"While we support the proposed allocation [ORGANIZATION] for rental assistance, we can all agree it's far from enough to prevent the disaster of homelessness for too many families, especially many [ORGANIZATION] families. We need a more systemic intervention than rental assistance. We know we lack the funding to cover the ongoing need in the community arising from the pandemic."
07_15_2020,unhoused,"But as we take the money and we appropriate support.  to our community that the federal government has allotted, it is very, very important that we go back to the baseline of humanity and look at the people that don't even have access to the opportunity like this to speak for themselves. In the act and then the things that the task force have laid out, they do plan to support the unhoused. That's obviously one facet that like  you know, on this kind of call, we're not going to see people that are unhoused speaking up."
07_15_2020,homeless,"Three, [ORGANIZATION] public health and [PERSON] response. And four, housing and household stability and [ORGANIZATION]. We also have two additional asks that you coordinate and track hate crimes."
07_15_2020,affordable housing,"I am a disabled gentleman living in affordable housing within [ORGANIZATION]. And I also serve on the board of directors of [ORGANIZATION], an affordable housing not-for-profit. I testify [ORGANIZATION] as a living example that affordable housing with access to technology does work."
07_15_2020,affordable housing,"Because I had a stroke, which left me partly paralyzed, because of the opportunity and stability of affordable housing with access to technology, I can testify [ORGANIZATION] as a contributing member of society rather than being unsheltered on the streets of [ORGANIZATION]. I testify that when you are living on a low fixed income, technology and the internet is an essential utility. With access to technology, I can research resources, do my work for society, and prevent social isolation, especially during this pandemic."
07_15_2020,affordable housing,"The FAC0 affordable housing development from [ORGANIZATION] is going to be constructed there. And we've done some outreach with ORG1 and they liked this idea of differentiating the ORG2-owned FAC1 bypass from the neighborhood [STREET] that really serves the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood and would be the front door of that building. So in our proposal, both FAC2 and [PERSON], the highway portion, the five-[STREET] portion, would become [PERSON]."
07_27_2016,homeless,"We've had some very attentive park rangers that helped resolve the issue. And I realized that what we're doing, we're criminalizing the homeless and making  I have a friend that lives on the same block as [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION], incredible, beautiful craftsman home. And she said, you know, if I was homeless, I'd be doing drugs too."
07_27_2016,homeless,"These people that are homeless need stability. Okay. More than anything else, they need stability."
07_27_2016,homeless,"I am a public safety policy analyst with [ORGANIZATION]. This [PERSON] would be a contract with ORG2 to remove solid waste at camping sites established by homeless individuals on public property. Since [ORGANIZATION], ORG2 has worked closely with other local government agencies and law enforcement to investigate and remove illegal dumps."
07_27_2016,homeless,"Keep coming back to it, yeah. Okay, go ahead and give us your name, and you have [TIME]. I'm [PERSON], and I disagree with PERSON1 about things and the other homeless person since I was homeless."
07_27_2016,homeless,I think these homeless camps on [ORGANIZATION] need to stop. There's a lot of littering and stuff like that. This isn't about the homeless camps.
07_27_2016,homeless,"Well, I encourage this, and I am going to go over to FAC0 and FAC1 and check out this homeless building that's being made where people can go there instead of sleeping outdoors. Now, here's what I'm saying also. Right near there is –  [ORGANIZATION], there's a bounty now on cans and bottles that keep them from being dumped in the woods."
07_27_2016,homeless,All you have to do is watch the embankments along there and see refuse. And it is an interesting situation where we don't know the source of that litter and trash. And I think homeless people may get scapegoated.
07_27_2016,homeless,"So I hope that as this project goes through and is managed, that we'll learn to be diligent and find out,  What is stuff left by homeless people who have no trash service? I mean, we'd like to – and what is stuff that other people who have homes but aren't willing to pay for their trash service have put in places where we maybe attribute that to the wrong people? Thank you."
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"Item 877. Okay. Authorize an intergovernmental agreement with [ORGANIZATION] to provide $96,999 in grant resources for a feasibility analysis on potential pay-for-success funding models to support the connection between affordable housing interventions and improved health outcomes for low-income households."
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"the division corridor will be a transportation lifeline that will connect this whole southeast area much better with more frequent service with better buses that are longer but not wider on interdivision just the same width that will be able to move more people on each trip that will reduce the number of passed by passengers in close in division and and make the the  speed of the movement through the entire corridor better for [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] residents. And it'll deal with the capacity issues and the need for more transit service in that area. But fundamentally, it's making real progress in areas that the city and the region need to progress toward, toward ensuring that there are places where people can live,  as areas become more prosperous, that the supply of affordable housing and the opportunities to stay in a community rather than be displaced from it are increased as we make strategic public investments."
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"Okay. So, the part of the plan that we're focusing on [ORGANIZATION] is the part related to housing development, affordable housing development, and economic development, community economic development. And the overview of the pieces of the plan or the actions that are included in the plan is shown on this slide, on the housing side of the strategy slide."
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"The overall point is to get more and to get better affordable housing in the corridor. And as [ORGANIZATION] pointed out, when we did the displacement or gentrification risk analysis [ORGANIZATION] as part of the comprehensive plan,  The south side of [ORGANIZATION] and all of [PERSON] popped out as a high-risk area given the characteristic income and the renters and the other characteristics of the households there. So even before there was a high-capacity transit project, we knew that this was a part of the city where we needed to pay attention to that issue."
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"The 300 number is not necessarily reflected of the overall need of affordable housing in the city or in this corridor. However, part of what we needed to do is to  make this in proportion to the size of the transit project and the sense that we have of what the impact would be. We thought that was a more reasonable [STREET] to sort of set this particular goal."
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"So you know the apartment buildings, especially that you see out east in [ORGANIZATION] on some of the lots, and their design need to be improved to benefit the households who live in those units more, and we're moving to evaluate and improve those standards. So overall, great. We hope that the multi-dwelling, the apartment buildings out in [ORGANIZATION] and elsewhere in the city will be better designed and will carry over into the affordable housing units as well, market rate and affordable."
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"This  This corridor includes two of those eight, [ORGANIZATION], which is helpful. But moreover, it is large enough that we think we can find opportunities within this area in [ORGANIZATION] to [STREET] 300 affordable housing units in the area. We don't budget specifically by allocating resources because it is so driven by opportunities."
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"Is your goal to have 300,000  New units of affordable housing, or is preservation part of your strategy? Well, this plan calls for 300 new units. We plan on, in addition, stabilizing the current stock to the greatest extent possible."
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"The site that we've been talking about is particularly a site that will be where the  Bus rapid transit intersects or at least comes in the vicinity of the white rail, so it's a major sort of transfer point, so we think it's an opportune site for affordable housing. You're targeting it. My final question is, does that displace any other affordable housing commitments or priorities that the district had previously put on the table that we're now shifting to this focus?"
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"We can get federal match for the transit component of this project. The federal government is not offering any match for the community mitigation pieces, so it makes it a little tougher for us to come up with the resources, but our commission felt that it was important that we do the mitigation, we commit to do the mitigation. We would also feel better if the affordable housing component of this mitigation plan was stronger than 300 units."
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"We appreciate the effort to get to 300 units, but we think the real impact is probably somewhat larger. And finally, we think that there are additional strategies you'd probably be adding to the toolkit. I think we heard one of them [ORGANIZATION], which is land banking in advance of the transit project, because, of course, as soon as the transit project appears to be certain, the public benefit of that transit project will wind up being reflected in the property values and we'll pay more to get the land for the affordable housing and the other needs that we have."
07_27_2016,affordable housing,So I was –  hardened here that [ORGANIZATION] was talking about acquiring property now before that value is fully baked in. We think that's an important strategy. We also feel like affordable housing retention in the corridor is an important strategy.
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"There's a number of organizations that have been really involved in digging into some of the tough questions that the council has been asking here around community stabilization and, of course, affordable housing production and preservation. Okay. So I think that, you know, overall the action plan, I do want to commend the staff that have been working on it for lifting up a lot of what we put in this toolkit, both from the legal tools that we have available to us and other some ideas that we haven't tried innovating yet."
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"You know, they're really excited about the project because it brings more access to opportunity for [ORGANIZATION] students. Thank you. and finally across the [STREET] on the southwest corner, we have jams for FAC0, a [ORGANIZATION] project and a future site for affordable housing."
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"We're intending to have 48 units of affordable housing there, which would be a great win for the community. That's a microcosm of the impact of this project on our neighbors and residents. You know, kind of going from that [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION] with [ORGANIZATION], our board voted to support the FAC0 project contingent on the funding for the mitigation strategies that were being proposed."
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"There's a whole suite of priorities there that are all great, but for us, really four rise to the top. The first is more affordable housing. 300 units is a great start."
07_27_2016,housing crisis,"I believe that this plan is the result of collaborative work between city [ORGANIZATION], all city [ORGANIZATION], community ORG1, ORG2, and ORG3ORG4ORG5. It provides muchORG4needed community stability actions to a transit project that can jeopardize a tenuous housing crisis in an already vulnerable community. I'm happy to see the business and technical assistance and workforce development tools addressed."
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] found them so beneficial, it has established a threshold by which any public project that meets the criteria automatically triggers a [ORGANIZATION], and I encourage the city of [PERSON] to adopt a similar model. I also wanted to just quickly address to you, Commissioner [PERSON], I love your idea about creating some type of model for mobile home parks as an affordable housing. And I encourage you to visit FAC0 at FAC1 and FAC2."
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"Sorry, I am concerned about the affordable housing because according to the chart on page 28, most of it is in [ORGANIZATION]. It's not along the corridor. There's $500,000 for outside of [ORGANIZATION] and $5.5 million within [ORGANIZATION]."
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"A big part of how we're thinking about [ORGANIZATION] of the affordable housing piece of this is a share of the new resources that are just coming forward now, as well as programs that even since we started this planning project, housing's been able to secure through different sources and been able to identify how they can target someone on the corridor. It's a DATE1 plan. One of the things that we thought was really critical was to give [ORGANIZATION] a sense of  the order of magnitude of cost of lift it is to even attempt to meet some objectives like this, both on the housing and the economic development side, and to fairly represent to city council sort of what we had in hand [PERSON] and then what we need to continue to work on through one means or another to secure to be able to follow through on this scale of effort."
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"PERSON0? Well, thank you to our [ORGANIZATION] and to everybody else who's participated in this [ORGANIZATION] – I'm sorry, [ORGANIZATION] –  I think it's a good plan, good questions about affordable housing, land use, and how we do this with buses quickly. And it's definitely a corridor in need of a lot of attention."
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"Thank you. And granted, 300 units is not enough, but I mean, I think that [ORGANIZATION] we probably would have said, well, maybe we are going to ask [ORGANIZATION] to stop because we don't know how we're going to get money for any significant investment in housing. One thing I want to note is that we also have heard from folks in the community that in addition to investment in affordable housing, they'd like to see stronger tenant protections."
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"We're going to have to think very carefully when we do have the locally preferred alternative, how do we get all of the other jurisdictions to pay their fair share and to make sure that collectively we can fund it? Because that's, as we know with affordable housing, it's a metro-wide project problem and challenge, and yet a lot of the burden falls on [ORGANIZATION]'s taxpayers. So, yeah."
07_25_2018,homeless,"So [ORGANIZATION], I wanted to look in your eyes and see the people intent on murdering me, my family, and the multitude of other homeless and transient people by legislating them into a constant status of prey for your predatory police. All we want is the right to exist without fear of abuse. When the government is the abuser, who is the mandatory reporter?"
07_25_2018,homeless,"If your position of preying on the homeless is just and moral, then you should have no problem killing me right here, right now. I'm here in courage. Are you going to join me or are you going to remain in fear as the coward you are?"
07_25_2018,homeless,"Next item, 802.  amend [ORGANIZATION] with [LOCATION] to authorize [ORGANIZATION] budget allocation to the [ORGANIZATION]. This item was also continued. Please call the roll."
07_25_2018,affordable housing,"Aye. The ordinance is adopted. Item 803.  authorize 11 sub-recipient contracts totaling $4,190,763 for services in support of providing affordable housing."
08_26_2015,homeless,But I signed up to talk on the state of the city so that I could speak about pretty much anything I wanted to. That was after my friend [ORGANIZATION] hosted a sleepover in front of FAC0 because the police were doing more sweeps on the homeless. I'm sure you're familiar with the situation.
08_26_2015,homeless,"All you have to do is change the wording of the statute, but that seems to be rather impossible. Anyway, the city is in peril. The homeless people can't seem to get a break and spend [ORGANIZATION] of action and testifying."
08_26_2015,homeless,"Thank you. 873. Item 873, a request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel regarding homeless issues."
08_26_2015,homeless,"874, a request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding homeless issues. Good morning. Good morning."
08_26_2015,houseless,"I'm [PERSON], for the record. I stay at [ORGANIZATION] myself on FAC0. The line between housing and house, the housed and houseless is very thin."
08_26_2015,affordable housing,How will we provide for those people and if we are not able to provide enough affordable housing for Portlanders DATE0? Although the city has the power to change this story with development happening citywide. [ORGANIZATION] strongly supports all the anti-displacement measures that are added to the comprehensive plan by [ORGANIZATION].
08_26_2015,houseless,"A critical policy was added to the [ORGANIZATION] plan says that the city must adequately involve communities that could be adversely affected by planning and development decisions. This means that the houseless community will have a stronger voice  Guiding how our city grows and develops with equity and inclusion is our ultimate goal. As part of a strong and growing group of 30 [ORGANIZATION] organizations, we are counting on [ORGANIZATION] to keep all these important anti-displacement measures in the final plan."
08_26_2015,houseless,"875, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding houseless issues. PERSON1, you're here. All right, we'll have to give him [ORGANIZATION], and then [LOCATION]."
08_26_2015,homeless,"876, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding homeless issues. Ms. [PERSON], are you here? Is she here?"
08_26_2015,homelessness,"So that's up to us. And I – That's a distinction probably lost on most people in the public where it says we're going to implement the recommendations and they have a budget cast. I mean, I was thinking, as I was thinking about your resolution, of preparing a resolution that accepts a report on homelessness and sets the council directive that we reduce it by 50%."
08_26_2015,homeless,"The result raised to the bottom with no one making a reasonable income in the fallout of our industry to most dedicated drivers. If the drivers are no longer able to earn an income, their option for family survival will be extremely limited. Drivers and their family could quickly become homeless and consequently depend upon welfare."
07_29_2015,affordable housing,"But experience in our sister cities on [ORGANIZATION] shows that the market, as currently shaped and structured, cannot assure the broad supply of housing available to families of modest means and even middle incomes we need. Of course, we should do what we can to build new affordable housing. But even if we are far more successful than we have been in the past, permanently affordable housing will never supply more than 3 or 4 percent of our housing stock."
08_02_2017,homeless,"There's no dispute about the goal here. But I am concerned about us setting expectations. And as you know, coming out of our most recent budget, you know, we're still scrambling to find money to fill potholes, to provide services for homeless people, to do a whole host of things."
08_02_2017,affordable housing,"But at some point, just as we stepped into the housing fray ahead of the state in order to put leverage on the state and in order to take care of the situation in our community,  [ORGANIZATION] quality seems every bit as important to me as affordable housing, and so I'd use exactly the parallel argument we use to pass a relocation ordinance. Well, let me just close by saying that the context for this discussion is –  a shared sense of frustration on this council agreed that on issues we care about we often find ourselves preempted by the state legislature abandoned by the federal government overturned by [ORGANIZATION] and and unclear about how we go forward so this is the context and i i applaud mayor your your um sense of righteous indignation about how we approach this problem  I guess I go back to what I said earlier, which is since we are investigating other regional authorities, since we are talking about a possible regional approach, I think bringing the council along early on in terms of potential frameworks and what this might look like is useful."
08_02_2017,homeless,"The organization has been operating with great success for [ORGANIZATION] out of [ORGANIZATION], and with this new school has now expanded to the east side in [ORGANIZATION], largely in response to the shifting demographics of the region. DATE1 I also worked on a project with [ORGANIZATION], transition projects, [ORGANIZATION], and ORG2. We transformed a building.  warehouse on southeast [PERSON] into [ORGANIZATION] [INSTITUTION]."
08_02_2017,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION], your company, which you're a co-founder of, commits a portion of your proceeds to benefit [PERSON], an organization that we're all very familiar with and very happy with. It's a local organization that mentors homeless and transitional youth. So you seem to have both head and heart."
08_02_2017,homelessness,"Second is how do we bring art and culture into the urban renewal conversation? And, you know, artists and artist affordability and those issues, they are never going to be as important as the acute crisis of homelessness, the affordability challenge generally faced by renters and others. We understand that."
08_02_2017,affordable housing,"I think as you approach the FAC0 blocks, there's a huge opportunity to think about art and makers in those. And the third question, and I guess this is mostly for [ORGANIZATION], we do know that we're going to have fewer resources for affordable housing. Now, [ORGANIZATION] is not the lead anymore."
08_02_2017,homeless,"And I'll be watching you as a watchdog very close. One of my issues or one of my points I wanted to bring up, again, on the housing, the most vulnerable people in our city, the homeless, people that live below the poverty line. I'm hoping that, again, [ORGANIZATION] will begin to look at following what [ORGANIZATION] just did, passing ORG1 [PERSON], to begin a process on looking at the universal basic income for all through [PERSON]."
08_02_2017,homeless,"Nobody to be excluded. And that means universal basic income will be paying [ORGANIZATION] $12,000 to $15,000 a year, as well as that person on the sidewalk. So again...  In my limited time here during public communication, when we're talking about the homeless, the most vulnerable, start focusing on that, at least take a look at it, and start having communication with people about it to have a better understanding."
08_02_2017,homeless,"Thank you. And I can't campaign for you, Mayor [PERSON]. I met you at your opening announcement, and I said my issues were protecting our water, homeless, and no demolition."
08_02_2017,homelessness,The hybrid also made sense if we could save money by slowly converting from the UV to filtration but I'm at the point where filtration makes the most sense to me because it actually will solve problems that are very likely to come in the future and like I said I'm  really concerned about low income rate payers. I am going to be working on stemming the tide of cost burdening and displacement and homelessness the whole time I'm here. So keeping people in their existing housing is very important to me and I think to the whole city.
06_17_2020,affordable housing,"Item 463. I'm in planning and zoning code, the comprehensive plan map, and the zoning map to implement the expanding opportunities for affordable housing project. Well, colleagues, this is the second reading."
06_17_2020,affordable housing,"When I first raised concerns about the project not requiring affordability, it seemed like that ship had sailed and there was nothing we could do about it. So I want to thank everyone who helped us  make the expanding opportunities for affordable housing project actually require affordability. Work isn't done."
06_17_2020,affordable housing,"Congratulations on your retirement at [ORGANIZATION]. You will be missed. And finally, I want to thank my colleagues for your support as we've worked quickly to strengthen this project while avoiding delays for projects that have been waiting to build affordable housing."
06_17_2020,affordable housing,Roots. This is a project that so many people can be proud of. It's a true collective effort by community and safe space organizations to use their property more creatively and flexibly for needed housing and now affordable housing.
06_17_2020,houseless,"And that affects us. tax payments and obedience to laws and whether you have protests, etc. Have them require to show you the pattern and history, for example, of the cop recklessly speeding or tailgating or crowding and show the, show whether the victims within that targeted hate groups like queer, trans, black, indigenous  [ORGANIZATION], houseless, or someone stuck in fear or pain that we call mental illness, and what neighborhoods these seem to repeatedly happen in. Five, the location, and it can have a graph over time, like [ORGANIZATION] is a business that can show you, answer any of your questions, like, are we seeing patterns here we need to address?"
06_17_2020,affordable housing,"And does this amendment apply only to middle housing or is it all new development, including expensive new development? So this change in code allows the type of developments that are anticipated under the [ORGANIZATION] to be developed by paying an LTIC charge. So there are in our administrative rules exemptions and those cover affordable housing developments and ADUs."
06_17_2020,affordable housing,"But essentially, there's not a threshold other than affordable housing for who would get an exemption. Thank you, [ORGANIZATION]. So this is PERSON1 with [ORGANIZATION] Manager for [ORGANIZATION]."
06_17_2020,affordable housing,"And it doesn't differentiate based on the type of housing, so a duplex, triplex, or a luxury single family home, except for as [ORGANIZATION] mentioned, there are waivers for affordable housing projects. Thank you. And then where can the LTIC money be used?"
06_17_2020,affordable housing,"And here's my question. What do you mean when you say affordable housing? Oh yeah, my bad."
06_17_2020,affordable housing,"We need moderately priced and affordable housing and the rational [STREET] improvements that come with the LTIC. We urge you to adopt this amendment. Thank you, [ORGANIZATION]."
06_28_2017,homeless,"Very quickly, there are two ways I could be helpful. The city is making mistakes with homeless people. I have spent...  [TIME] DATE0 for [LOCATION]."
06_28_2017,homeless,Can I go on for... Good. I could be helpful there in telling you how to address the homeless issue.
06_28_2017,affordable housing,I think it would be very odd if the cities in the business of acquiring properties preserve affordable housing than displacing people. So can you give us an update on that? Sure.
09_06_2017,homeless,"I do approve of the appointments and the reappointments of all individuals here. I think your qualifications are very good and essential for [ORGANIZATION]. One of the concerns I have, though, with your organization is that I myself would like to see more of the artists tapped out in the community, in the homeless community."
09_06_2017,homeless,"I want to see more art on the walls created by the homeless, such as, you know, [ORGANIZATION] went into [ORGANIZATION] and painted the doors. This has been very beneficial. It brings...  a light into situations that is very positive."
09_06_2017,homeless,"Art lifts the spirits of people, and I want to see the homeless community involved more to whatever degree, any direction they go, but have that opportunity to look at different things and different ways of doing things and different enjoyment that you can get from art. One of my first art pieces was  that I purchased was from the late Dr. [PERSON] and [PERSON], great friends with the [PERSON] family. And I really enjoyed the artwork."
09_06_2017,homeless,"And those are lasting things that you can purchase through people and remember them. It's essential that you reach out to the homeless community and begin seeing the true inspiration from art that it can bring people. An example, in the past I went to FAC0 and it was a Native American."
09_06_2017,homeless,Reach out to the homeless community and offer more to them. They are in the most need of great art and the ability to make art. Thank you.
09_06_2017,homeless,"and people who have limited English proficiency, low income or underrepresented communities. Our community advisory group represented many groups that are listed here. Many of them were transit riders themselves, but also include [ORGANIZATION], members from [ORGANIZATION], or ORG2, which was included two [ORGANIZATION] students, [PERSON], who serves homeless and transitioning them from the streets to homes,  [ORGANIZATION], ORG6, ORG7, [ORGANIZATION], ORG9, [ORGANIZATION]0, and various neighborhood associations."
09_06_2017,affordable housing,"Colleagues, [ORGANIZATION] administers the city's affordable housing property tax exemption programs. [ORGANIZATION] provides a [ORGANIZATION] limited tax exemption to low- to moderate-income homebuyers, making homeownership more affordable for families in [ORGANIZATION]. The [ORGANIZATION] Housing Bureau approves bidder-builder applications."
06_27_2018,homeless,"And it used to be really, really nice, and you could get by on the sidewalks. But now we have so many homeless people that are actually camping out on our narrow sidewalks that you can't get around them. And you ask them politely to move, and they get belligerent."
06_27_2018,housing crisis,"We're in [ORGANIZATION] of an unprecedented housing crisis. Really wish we were unprecedented, but it's unprecedented. We are coming up on DATE1 of a declared housing state of emergency."
06_27_2018,housing crisis,"ADUs are a promising opportunity. component of addressing our housing shortage and housing crisis. However, there is currently no loan product available for ADUs, which means that average [ORGANIZATION] homeowners, most average [ORGANIZATION] homeowners can't afford to develop them."
06_27_2018,housing crisis,"So this is a very targeted targeted waiver meant to encourage people to develop the housing that we actually need. So we are going to be receiving a  [ORGANIZATION] reports from [ORGANIZATION] on this program, and we will certainly revisit it as the situation we're in evolves, whether we end our housing crisis, which is unlikely to happen anytime soon, or we're able to bring a loan product to the market that makes a  this opportunity to develop ADUs more accessible to more [ORGANIZATION]. So thank you again, and I vote aye."
06_27_2018,affordable housing,"I support creating options that increase the overall supply of affordable housing. I am concerned that there's no expiration on the waiver, and the policy is still experimental on many levels. I'm hopeful that the reports from [ORGANIZATION] will give the council a clearer picture of whether the qualifying accessory dwelling units are actually affordable."
06_27_2018,unhoused,"Recently, I published a case study about past [ORGANIZATION] grants that funded work that included unhoused Portlanders to inspire more cohesive community work for environmental benefits. The second project I would like to highlight is [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION]. This project will provide resources, education, and assistance for low-income residents in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood."
06_27_2018,houseless,"Thank you, Commissioners, and thank you for hearing us out. My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I am one of the [ORGANIZATION] organizers, and I wanted to come before you [ORGANIZATION] to talk about what we do. One of the majority of the things we do is we provide our houseless neighbors with food, hygiene items, clothing, and water."
06_27_2018,houseless,"And on another note, we also talk with our houseless folks and engage them. And one of the things that we ask that they do is when we provide them the trash bags is that they bag their trash. And they do that"
06_27_2018,houseless,"So we come before you [ORGANIZATION] to thank you for hearing us and for hopefully providing us the necessary funds to get a new trailer that will allow us to continue to pick up these large amounts of garbage and remove them from our neighborhoods and continue to build this bridge between our houseless and our housed neighbors. And also what we do is we also educate them on the need to recycle, the need to, if they do have a substance abuse problem, to use our approved containers to put their discarded needles in. And they are receptive to that as well."
06_27_2018,houseless,"He became involved because he became aware that there were some people who were housed, two men in particular on FAC0, who were threatening our houseless neighbors. And so approached them and said, you know, approached the houseless folks and said, we're here to help. Tell us what you might need."
06_27_2018,houseless,"Anything from going around and helping with the loading and meeting with the houseless folks to making peanut butter and jelly sandwiches [ORGANIZATION]. We distribute on average about 160 of those sandwiches [ORGANIZATION]. And basically, we have several desired outcomes that we're looking for, looking to achieve with this program."
06_27_2018,houseless,"The other goals are more directly related to our houseless community as well as our housed neighbors. One is we want the houseless community to have a healthier and a safer environment in which they live. Unsheltered though it may be, we can at least rid them of trash that might attract rodents and other things that are health risks to them."
06_27_2018,houseless,"And then the fourth is equally important. One of the things that we aspire to is that through the interaction of our volunteers who are housed and as they come to know and understand that many of the houseless folks are just like them but for different circumstances, that there will come to be a mutual understanding and respect.  and slowly and organically that this can maybe spread out in our community. Thank you for the opportunity to speak."
07_18_2018,affordable housing,"Appreciate it. 746, please. Authorized purchase of certain real property located at [ADDRESS] at a price and closing costs not to exceed $558,000 to develop new affordable housing."
07_18_2018,affordable housing,"So, colleagues, this is yet another property associated with [ORGANIZATION]. The housing bond promised 1,300 units of permanently affordable housing, and it promised that that would be created within a five- to [DATE] timeframe of passage. In [ORGANIZATION], we have approximately half of the promised units either already purchased or in process in both new developments and acquisitions of existing buildings."
07_18_2018,affordable housing,"This acquisition represents the fourth project identified under the housing bond. [ORGANIZATION] is excited to bring this ordinance before the council DATE0 as another step towards meeting the goals of the housing bond. The acquisition of this property will create 50 to 75 new units of affordable housing in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood, a neighborhood on the front lines of gentrification and displacement."
07_18_2018,homeless,"Future development of this property will create additional family-sized units for households earning 0% to 30% [ORGANIZATION], as well as providing more supportive housing units to the city in coordination with [ORGANIZATION]. And just colloquially, 0% to 30%, that is housing with support services for the people we are seeing on the streets, people who are chronically homeless, people who are in crisis. This not only allows them access to housing that they can afford and be successful in, it will also provide opportunities for services."
07_18_2018,homelessness,"Under the housing bond, we are seeking to create new housing and well as prevent displacement. That's why we're both investing in properties for new development as well as acquiring existing buildings. We are prioritizing communities of color, families and households facing homelessness or displacement."
07_18_2018,homelessness,"It's a wise long-term investment. And we know that it's going to be supporting the folks that are experiencing homelessness and families that are really vulnerable to displacement. So with that, I think it's an excellent investment."
07_18_2018,affordable housing,"And so I thought that was an important connection to make here between folks who are involved in grassroots affordable housing advocacy on the ground who themselves are facing a crisis in their own housing, and this bond has directly supported them in finding permanent, stable, affordable homes. But that does lead me to note that the bond and all of the acquisitions that are being made with it are, as I know you have all noted, are one piece of the affordable housing puzzle in [ORGANIZATION]. And so building on this momentum in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood, we're excited that the manufactured housing park zoning proposal is coming to council very soon, which will –  prevent the displacement of over 3,000 households in this city, which is more than twice as many as will be served by the bond itself."
07_18_2018,affordable housing,"And then...  The last piece that I wanted to mention for the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood is our ongoing work led by [ORGANIZATION] to develop affordable housing on the former FAC0 property that Living [ORGANIZATION] was able to acquire in [ORGANIZATION]. So this bond acquisition is very exciting news for our neighborhood, and we are very eager to work with  and with ORG2 to keep that momentum rolling into the next steps for preserving affordable housing, building new affordable housing, and preventing displacement in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood and across the city. Thank you."
07_18_2018,affordable housing,"Thank you. So it is because of that we do encourage the development of permanently affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION], and we're delighted to learn of this new development that will join the more than 300 units of affordable housing owned by [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], the many more development units that will be developed on the property formerly known as [ORGANIZATION],  the 59 units that's being built by a local developer in conjunction with ORG2 and ORG3 on FAC1. This is very exciting for us and one thing we'd like to make sure of is that these affordable units do benefit people who in [ORGANIZATION] who are at risk of displacement  first and foremost, and we hope that [LOCATION] can find a [STREET] to reach out to folks like the residents of the [ORGANIZATION] apartments who are being displaced by economic forces, and we don't want to lose those folks from our neighborhood."
07_18_2018,affordable housing,"All the active groups in [ORGANIZATION], including [ORGANIZATION], for identifying yet another site to develop affordable housing for our residents. It sounds like a great piece of property, and I'm sure it will be a great thing we put on that property, too. Aye."
07_18_2018,homeless,"Will you sanction a homeless camp? Next individual, please. Next individual, please."
07_18_2018,homeless,We're going to start a homeless camp. Excuse me. This is in violation of council rules.
07_18_2018,homeless,"Obviously, that's the president of the union representing the police when facing facts that  Unfortunately, your administration didn't discover on its own. We had to rely on the Oregonian? We had to rely on the freaking Oregonian to tell us that over half the people processed by [ORGANIZATION] police are homeless."
07_18_2018,homeless,"And as of yet, we know that the independent police review is doing an investigation that will...  go on while probably hundreds of other homeless people are pointlessly processed through the jail. And I hope that when the brilliant leadership that [ORGANIZATION] gives [ORGANIZATION] is fully processed with this investigation, we'll see that  It probably wasn't the best idea to throw another million dollars at them just because Permit [PERSON] is concerned about the 911 response time when she calls to complain about black people having a barbecue. So please, you know, there are people that engage with the community well in [ORGANIZATION]."
07_18_2018,affordable housing,"I have been heavily involved in the design of large scale mixed use projects in downtown [ORGANIZATION] and the project that was mentioned is a potential development of a 35 story tower which has three components, an office component, a hotel component and a mixed use or a residential component. The [STREET] the ordinance is currently written right now, we would actually have to pay for a fee in lieu of almost $29 million to offset just 28 affordable housing units, which would frankly kill the project. I think it's fair to have this payment be attributable only to the residential units."
07_18_2018,homeless,"742, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding homeless issues.  Is Ms. [PERSON] here [ORGANIZATION]? I don't see her. Have any items been pulled from the consent agenda, [ORGANIZATION]?"
08_24_2017,housing crisis; affordable housing,"Thanks for being here [ORGANIZATION]. Next item, please. 9.43, authorize construction and permanent financing in an amount not to exceed $5,766,[ADDRESS] to facilitate the affordable redevelopment project known as [ORGANIZATION].  Colleagues, as a city, we're responding to the urgency of the housing crisis with unprecedented affordable housing production. In [LOCATION], we've worked to triple our pipeline of affordable housing units, now with 2,200 units currently under development."
08_24_2017,affordable housing,"One of these 72 fosters is expected to break ground in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood [ORGANIZATION]. It's an innovative project that leverages the combined strengths of three valued nonprofit partners, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and ORG2, to create culturally responsive affordable housing that will serve a diverse mix of households and help prevent the displacement of minority communities here in [ORGANIZATION]. Conceived as an intergenerational mixed-use development, [ORGANIZATION] will provide more than 100 units for low-income households within the most concentrated Asian American population in the entire state of [ORGANIZATION]."
08_24_2017,affordable housing,"We're developing this, and they're going to be the resident service providers you heard in the building. So again, this is kind of a dream come true for both organizations that we're able to make this happen in the [ORGANIZATION] area. I think it also is worth saying that [ORGANIZATION] has helped us better understand the ways in which cultural communities work.  may sometimes feel shut out of traditional affordable housing, especially if we don't take into account different languages, traditions, or a sense of mistrust that sometimes people have with institutions."
08_24_2017,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] gave the background of how much we'd worked and how long we worked with [ORGANIZATION] on this vision. And in the time of the [ORGANIZATION] election, federal tax credits are the main [STREET] that we finance affordable housing nationwide. And right after the election, this project, as every other project in the nation, faced a budget shortage."
08_24_2017,affordable housing,"So that is all on reach. We take all the risk to do that, to allow the affordable housing financing partners in the project to know that their portion of the project is protected. So that gives us more flexibility to work with our community partners, but also with leasing agents to try to meet that vision that both [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] talked about, to lease it the [STREET] in which we want."
08_24_2017,affordable housing,"But you've got now a resource that's a great community resource. And I think the larger question is, how does [ORGANIZATION], ORG1 going forward in the city, help you be successful in really leveraging that space? Because that space there and another nonprofit affordable housing development throughout the city I think increasingly is going to become a more valuable asset."
08_24_2017,homelessness,"But we do have, like you pointed out, the subsidized units. So it's affordable to people with very low income or zero income potentially. So it will be open and available to potentially people coming out of homelessness."
08_24_2017,affordable housing,"With [ORGANIZATION], this will be the first time that they have been providing resident services in an affordable housing building like this. So it's a new partnership. So the other thing we're going to be doing here is learning."
08_24_2017,homelessness,"And so I think we're also being cautious about how many formal commitments we make on the service side up front. But clearly, they would tell you.  very clearly that homelessness in the Asian communities they serve is often visible. They're not always counted."
08_24_2017,homeless,"They're often staying with people in circumstances that are not being – that aren't visible. And so they see this as a huge opportunity to provide housing and services to people that are extremely vulnerable and homeless. So –  I believe that the partnership we have with them is going to serve the intent of the commitment to permanent supportive housing, even though you don't see that here as a formal agreement per se."
08_24_2017,affordable housing,"I believe, and I may be wrong, but I believe this land was purchased when [ORGANIZATION] was mayor. and it was long before people really thought that foster, this section of foster, was going to be a focal point of our affordable housing strategy. But a little PDC money and a little housing money went, I believe, to purchase the property, which was not in great condition."
08_24_2017,affordable housing,"to getting affordable housing stock into the community. And even with the financial resources ready and available, it still has taken [ORGANIZATION] to get to this point. So it's a good illustration that we have the right players, we have the right funding resources, we have the right visions, but none of this comes easily and none of it comes quickly."
08_24_2017,houseless,"There are no organizations of houseless persons on that list,  or even advocates. Next, the desired effect of the [ORGANIZATION] making informed recommendations will be better served by requiring meetings with members of the bodies now outlined in Deliverable No. 7 as optional. [PERSON], ORG2, [PERSON], [LOCATION], as [ORGANIZATION],  [ORGANIZATION] is required in the new document to meet with ORG6, ORG7, and the new [ORGANIZATION]."
06_22_2017,affordable housing,"We do have duplexes in our neighborhood under the current infill that is allowed on corner lots, and those have worked out well. But moving to higher density, I think, is beyond the scope of our testimony [ORGANIZATION]. Yeah, I know you haven't had that discussion, and as you know, you can't put a duplex on a corner, so since they're creating several corners, that might be a [STREET] to have still single-family homes that are  on their own lot perhaps even, that would be less expensive because we had several of the neighbors concerned about affordable housing and also potentially have less impact on the resource."
08_03_2017,homelessness,"But then immediately seeing the homelessness here, knowing some of those people there are veterans as well. And then also seeing this environment that's related directly to this issue is actually fomenting the circumstances for extremism. and why that can't be resolved, why you can't find a [STREET] to actually meaningfully interact with the community in such a [STREET] that they are actually dictating, not dictating in terms, but setting the agenda for how they can actually protect themselves."
08_03_2017,homeless,"They see all the homeless people on the [STREET], and they wonder, why are the elected officials not listening to the people? Where's the actual governance on behalf of the people? Not just a bunch of public testimony, but where is the true oversight of our city, the governing of our city, according to the will of the people?"
08_03_2017,houseless,"Okay. And [ORGANIZATION]'s rules are very dear to my heart. In [ORGANIZATION] I received a notice on [ORGANIZATION] letterhead and as a tenant I thought that that was an eviction notice because as a tenant, as a renter, I live with that fear every day due to [ORGANIZATION]'s inadequate laws for the houseless population and the renter class, although we have made strides with relocation assistance which I'm really looking forward to talking to the commissioners about [LOCATION]."
08_03_2017,affordable housing,"Affordable housing is the next one at [DATE], and then the [ORGANIZATION] appointments. I've got an idea, and I'll probably not endure myself with my colleagues, but we have precedent for this. Mayor, why don't we schedule this at a time certain on either [ORGANIZATION] or DATE1 at [TIME]?"
09_04_2019,homeless,"Priorities and then general fund resources have been really important contributors to the district livability. priorities for the community and [ORGANIZATION] with [ORGANIZATION] as well as PERSON1 with ORG1 are here and can speak to those priorities a bit further. So, again, just kind of a recap."
09_04_2019,affordable housing,Three out of four units of housing in the area is long-term stabilized affordable housing. And so a mix of income units has long been a desired outcome for the community. We're happy to say we reached 260 of those 500 new moderate income units and some of that was thanks to a pilot SDC deduction that we're actually not asking for as part of this extension because we feel as though both the market as well as inclusionary housing can continue to deliver on that mixed income.
09_04_2019,homeless,"Good morning. Good morning, Mayor and Commissioners. I'm [PERSON] and I'm the Director of [ORGANIZATION]."
09_04_2019,homeless,"I'll probably touch on a number of points that [ORGANIZATION] just also spoke to in terms of the task force. But it will give you a little more historic context for some of the recommendations that we made and that I think are also advanced through the extension or the proposed extension of the [ORGANIZATION] plan. So for [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] supported the work of a task force that started out as just [ORGANIZATION], but later expanded to include [PERSON]."
09_04_2019,homelessness,"The task force, as [ORGANIZATION] said, first came together in response to the plan to site a new shelter for people experiencing homelessness on FAC0. From the beginning, the charge of the task force was more than just planning for the new shelter. The city and the county through the joint office committed as part of the discussion about the shelter to work with local community stakeholders."
09_04_2019,homelessness; affordable housing,"With input from a wide range of stakeholders, including businesses and homeowners, affordable housing tenants, social service providers, people with lived experience, and a variety of government entities from the city and county, [ORGANIZATION] first developed a good neighbor agreement for the navigation center, which as you likely know, opened and welcomed its first guests [ORGANIZATION]. It will ultimately have 100 people staying at it at any given time working on transitioning out of homelessness and back into housing. Once that good neighbor agreement was complete, we developed a set of recommendations to improve social service delivery in the neighborhoods."
09_04_2019,homelessness,We then used a similar process of convening practitioners and stakeholders to develop a comprehensive list of some 25 recommendations related to improving the sense of safety for everyone in the neighborhoods. These recommendations included everything from foot patrols to activating public spaces to improving training for private security to improving the responsiveness of law enforcement to the safety needs of people experiencing homelessness. And to expanding criminal justice diversion programs.
09_04_2019,homeless,"And, of course, the homeless services is all general fund. It's 100% at this point. Well, which is, again, my concern of us making commitments of general fund resources so early on."
09_04_2019,homeless,"The city aroused people that camped there. I have to say this, and I don't want to turn on homeless people, but I do not believe people should be able to, or should camp out or camp at the [INSTITUTION], anywhere near the [INSTITUTION]. Okay?"
09_04_2019,homeless,"And I could be accused of turning on homeless people if you're going to camp. Nowhere else but that [STREET]. If you want to keep it look like a Swiss [INSTITUTION], you've got to solve that problem."
09_04_2019,homeless,"And I may turn on homeless people camped out at the [ORGANIZATION] [INSTITUTION] because they're going to get rousted [ORGANIZATION] anyway. So, which makes me look at it elitist, like I'm living in [ORGANIZATION], I'm over [LOCATION], I'm under [PERSON], I'm on food stamps, like I'm an honored [ORGANIZATION] citizen. But that's the [STREET] it is."
09_04_2019,affordable housing,"It's not as they say to me as they pat my head, it's really middle class housing or medium income housing or middle income housing or one of the five to ten terms used to really not address who is it that you're putting that sign out. Who is included in not being able to participate in market rate housing in this attachment, of the matter is in [ORGANIZATION] they've done great work at bringing affordable housing and market rate housing into balance and now they're going to kick it all the [STREET] out and so there's pie charts"
09_04_2019,houseless,But I think I'm comfortable in knowing that there's a vision that's working very cooperatively with the neighborhood. I do have some concerns about... what clean and safe will look like in this new extension how are we decriminalizing a lot of transient houseless people who live in that area and how we can be less reliant on law enforcement responses to people who quite frankly are ill or have nowhere else to go. It is heartbreaking to see the people that hang out in [ORGANIZATION] [DATE] with no access to resources and so I hope this helps to build or revitalize businesses in [ORGANIZATION] as well as take a humane approach to the people who are trying to survive on the streets outside of [ORGANIZATION] as well.
09_04_2019,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION], who is here to give a presentation on the homeless services. Many, many people came together from [ORGANIZATION] to help shape this extension. It's comprehensive, it focuses on neighborhood investment."
09_04_2019,affordable housing,"So the garage is co-owned between [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], and there will be a third, we own the air rights [ORGANIZATION], there could be a third-party ownership for the air rights. And to the question about why not include residential, is it zoning, is it um it's actually we've prioritized it around office given the access to access to transit and that [ORGANIZATION] district is a really important job center and that tends to be how we kind of promote our properties first and foremost for jobs And as was mentioned, I think ORG2 doesn't have a significant amount of remaining resources. And so most often when we're partnering on housing projects, we're partnering with ORG3 around mixed income and or affordable housing."
09_04_2019,affordable housing,"I don't think housing would be a top priority, but I agree that if you're selling the air rights, And if you're going to sell the air rights, then it should be up to the person doing the development, unless we have clear criteria for who should be invited to apply, especially if they're making sure that we have permanently affordable housing for small business space for small businesses. we are not investing in small businesses at all in a [STREET] that's going to help them thrive over the long haul and so I'm just concerned we keep making the advantages for the big ones but the small ones are still suffering. I want to make sure that we are also selling the design products so we could certainly list it as the air rights for kind of any use and then the air rights plus the design product for office use."
09_04_2019,affordable housing,"But we had testimony about the affordable housing development on FAC0. Again, in [ORGANIZATION] when that property was in the portfolio of [ORGANIZATION], it was slated to be a luxury hotel. Yes."
09_04_2019,affordable housing,"And when it transferred to the new [ORGANIZATION] and then was subject to the guidelines of affordable housing, we ended up with the vision that we currently have, which is affordable housing there on a fantastic location. So I couldn't be prouder of that. So thank you very much."
09_04_2019,homeless; affordable housing,"I think it's worth highlighting, though, because it does look bad to the public when we're spending $1.5 million on something that seems relatively frivolous compared to some of the more urgent issues we're facing. But what they often don't know is that these... are earmarked for very specific things. And for instance, we absolutely could not take this $1.5 million and spend it on affordable housing or homeless services."
06_30_2016,affordable housing,"So with that, please read the item and we'll turn to my colleague, Commissioner [PERSON]. Refer a measure to the city voters for the [ORGANIZATION] general election authorizing the issuance of general obligation bonds in the amount of $258,400,000 to provide funding for affordable housing. Commissioner [PERSON]."
06_30_2016,affordable housing,"Thank you, Mayor and colleagues. People who have grown up in [ORGANIZATION] and want to raise their families here are not able to because of escalating rents and low vacancies. Seniors who have lived here and who have contributed to our city over their entire lives are no longer able to find safe, affordable housing here."
06_30_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"Workers who contribute day in and day out to our city's economic vibrancy cannot afford to live in the city in which they work. As I've said before, the lack of affordable housing is the greatest crisis now facing our city. It's a crisis with a very human toll, and it will take all of us working together together  to make a real dent in solving this crisis the council over [ORGANIZATION] first looked to our existing resources and as mayor [ORGANIZATION] has said we dug deep we in we increased the urban renewal funds dedicated to affordable housing by 50 we dedicated short-term rental talk rental tax revenues to the effort and we committed 10 million dollars DATE1 which starts DATE2  to help more folks find move from homelessness into housing next we looked at a means to ensure that the new growth that new growth would pay for its effect on the need for affordable housing and [ORGANIZATION] i'm proud to say this council unanimously established a commercial excise tax on new development and it dedicated 100 of that excise tax to creating more affordable housing"
06_30_2016,affordable housing,"so we dug deep in the city's budget we've asked development to pay  for its impact on the need for affordable housing, and now we're asking [ORGANIZATION] voters to step up to the plate by supporting a bond for affordable housing. This bond is specifically targeted toward achieving deeply affordable housing for households making less than 30% of median family income. Those are seniors on fixed incomes, families with a disabled parent, and workers who earn minimum wage."
06_30_2016,homelessness,and then we have uh two invited panels okay great good [TIME] mayor [ORGANIZATION] members of [ORGANIZATION] uh with me is [PERSON] who's going to be writing a powerpoint so i don't get distracted from from my uh verbal remarks  This is the last major fiscal building block in [ORGANIZATION]'s response to the state of emergency for homelessness and housing.
06_30_2016,homeless,You previously took steps to increase the general fund allocation. including money for [ORGANIZATION] for voucher utilization and for the full funding of ORG1. You previously took action to allocate and appropriate additional monies for the tax increment financing lift.  which will have profound effects throughout the city and the open urban renewal areas.
06_30_2016,homeless,"And then last, but certainly not least, we'll be working diligently with [ORGANIZATION] to implement [PERSON], this being [ORGANIZATION] that our office is responsible. DATE1, of course, the staff will migrate to [ORGANIZATION] office. So we'll be very busy over DATE2."
06_30_2016,affordable housing,You've given us the tools we need to succeed. And I'd like [ORGANIZATION] to be known as [ORGANIZATION] of hope as we deal with the problems that we have throughout the city to work with renters who are in desperate need of assistance and to try to backfill voids in our housing delivery system with permanently affordable housing. What you do [ORGANIZATION] will have lasting benefits for [ORGANIZATION].
06_30_2016,homeless,"On the far left, the shelter budget you see is serving some 5,000 people.  about $15 million a year with homeless prevention, keeping people in their homes through short-term rental assistance and other interventions, serving about 5,800 people, housing placement and retention,  some $15 million of general fund and federal funds, serving some 4,300 people. Supportive housing and services at [TIME] on the dial is serving some 3,000 households with about $9 million of general fund and federal funds. And then we have the capital cost, if you will, of regulated affordable rental housing, showing the interplay of the construction excise tax monies that you approved [ORGANIZATION], the bond that you have before you [PERSON], and, of course, the baseline of tax increment."
06_30_2016,affordable housing,"affordable housing in outlying jurisdictions, and some of them might be the places where the jobs are too. So if we were able to build in [ORGANIZATION], I'd like you to look into that possibility. And then my final question is, do we have a partnership agreement with the county so that there'll be some help in operating these units and providing services, especially in the [ORGANIZATION] range?"
06_30_2016,affordable housing,"And you have done a lot, but we're not done yet. We still have thousands of people in our community who don't earn enough to pay the exorbitant amounts that new apartments cost. And since our existing stock is full and rents are rising a double digit, that means if we want to help people move off the streets and into housing, if we want to help seniors who are living on fixed incomes, and we want to help families who are working but still struggling,  We need this bond because we need to build more affordable housing."
06_30_2016,homeless,"DATE0, we were homeless, and we ended up nowhere to go. We slept in the car. My wife, [ORGANIZATION], she's not here right now."
06_30_2016,homeless,"Then I met [ORGANIZATION], which helped us get out of our state. The reason why we were homeless is because basically our landlord had failed to tell us that his house was foreclosed on. And it was just a big shock."
06_30_2016,affordable housing,Good luck to you. [ORGANIZATION] welcome thank you mayor [PERSON] commissioners my name is [ORGANIZATION] bonacore i'm the executive director of [ORGANIZATION] we administer the housing choice voucher program and a portfolio of public and affordable housing throughout [PERSON] the majority of our funding comes from [ORGANIZATION]
06_30_2016,homelessness,"And a crazy thing happened along the [STREET]. As [ORGANIZATION]'s budget declined, mass homelessness emerged in this country. It hadn't existed before as we know it [ORGANIZATION]."
06_30_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"Abundant affordable housing was the prevention for homelessness, and affordable housing remains the solution. Shelter gets people inside, and we need to get people inside. And it is not the answer to their homelessness."
06_30_2016,homelessness,"Housing is. Thank you. In [ORGANIZATION] or so, I think I've heard each of you acknowledge that the federal government needs to play their part in ending homelessness."
06_30_2016,homeless,And you're right. And we proved you're right when we worked together to house homeless veterans. We coordinated our efforts.
06_30_2016,homelessness,The country prevented mass homelessness in [ORGANIZATION] and prior. We just demonstrated with vets we can do it again. Homelessness is solvable.
06_30_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"Together, we will deliver what's being promised to the voters, and we'll take another critical step in doing everything in our power to address this crisis. We must, because affordable housing is the solution to homelessness, and homelessness is a choice that this country does not have to continue to make. Homelessness is solvable."
06_30_2016,homelessness,"I am a housing case manager for a local nonprofit here. The purpose for me being here is to kind of give you a little bit of my backstory as well. I, too, just as this gentleman shared, had experienced homelessness DATE0."
06_30_2016,homeless,"I've worked through a lot of the struggles that a lot of the homeless folks here have. continue to see [ORGANIZATION] I am right there on the front lines to walk them through to hopefully get them to safety once again as they once were it took a lot of dedication a lot of hope a lot of [STREET] and people a lot of support helped me to get me through to where I am [PERSON] and I continue to look for those people to support me as well  I'm not afraid to ask for assistance any longer where before pride gotten away, it's been difficult, but I know that we, as a city, I've, I've made [ORGANIZATION] my home."
06_30_2016,homelessness,"And, um,  One thing that I started to notice when I came here was that there was an epidemic of homelessness. Before I'd even been here for [ORGANIZATION] yet, I'd seen it, people sleeping under bridges. And I remember riding the ORG0 train, and I said, that's never going to be me."
06_30_2016,homelessness,"That doesn't count for families. I had a no-cause eviction back in [ORGANIZATION], and I thought that my homelessness was over. And to continue to work with those individuals and tell them that everything is going to be okay when in the same thought, you're suffering too.  or bound to suffer and get through that same thing."
06_30_2016,homeless,"I luckily was able to find a landlord that looked beyond some of my faults. I now am rent burdened, but I'd rather be rent burdened than homeless. We pay $2,700 a month for a three-bedroom home where there's eight people in it."
06_30_2016,homelessness,"It's a little tight fit, but we're happy.  because I know that there's worse situations. And I told them before I even, all of this, I said if this is what's making this whole issue difficult is me, then I will go back to homelessness before I allow my family. Luckily, that didn't happen."
06_30_2016,affordable housing,"I continue to go into work with a smile, and I love what I do. But I know that affordable housing is a huge need. I house veterans and civilians."
06_30_2016,homelessness,"And I take my hat off to the people that do it [ORGANIZATION] to try to reach out. They're not – some of those people aren't here [LOCATION]. to voice that, and I feel that I am that voice, a proud father, a very new social worker, but very determined in homelessness, one step at a time, whatever that looks like."
06_30_2016,affordable housing,My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I'm with [ORGANIZATION]. We really urge you [ORGANIZATION] to support the affordable housing general obligation bond that will be sent to voters in [LOCATION].
06_30_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,"we also thank the leadership of the city [ORGANIZATION] and their their supporters for really prioritizing solutions to address our housing crisis we also commend the city on their ongoing efforts around inclusionary housing implementation and the construction excise tax however we all know  Not one of these solutions will be enough on their own, and we need to continue working diligently to find solutions so that we can really create a truly equitable, inclusive, affordable, and livable city here. So like the city leads the country on sustainability and planning, we can, too, lead the city on affordable housing, a fundamental right. So again, the coalition, we're an alliance of 19 culturally specific community-based organizations from six communities of color, African, African-American, Latino, Native American, and Slavic."
06_30_2016,homelessness,"And our Native American average household can only afford to rent a studio in one. And again, there's not a single neighborhood in the city that is affordable for a one-bedroom or more to the average African American or Native American household. And again, our families disproportionately bear the burden of homelessness."
06_30_2016,homeless; homelessness,"While we saw pretty much a steady homeless population from the count in time from [ORGANIZATION] to [LOCATION] alone,  It increased for communities of color. There's a greater percentage and number of people of color on the streets or couch surfing or living in vehicles or doubled up. So we know that helping homelessness is a difficult challenge."
06_30_2016,affordable housing,"As we've heard, the failure of the private market to develop affordable housing is deplorable. And the failure of all levels of government to provide public housing also serves to fail our low-income residents and households. One cannot even get onto a waiting list for public housing [ORGANIZATION]."
06_30_2016,housing crisis,"And I just have to reiterate, for our communities, for all communities, the impacts of the housing crisis and disparities for our communities go far beyond wealth creation. Home ownership and housing stability also affect education attainment, community and public health, access to jobs and transit, business, and overall quality of life. Portlanders are actually already paying for the housing crisis right now."
06_30_2016,affordable housing,"We're seeing it in costs for policing, in costs for health care and direct service costs, lost economic development and worker productivity. So no matter your passion, environment, public parks, business, economic development, public health, it's all connected to this fundamental issue of providing affordable housing. So [ORGANIZATION]..."
06_30_2016,affordable housing,"We have the opportunity to approve a historic investment in affordable housing for the [ORGANIZATION] ballot, and we ask for your support. The bond could help fill [ORGANIZATION]'s 24,000-unit gap with at least 1,300 high-quality affordable housing units, which would help house 2,900 [ORGANIZATION]ers. [ORGANIZATION] referring this affordable housing bond measure to the voters is a critical step."
06_30_2016,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] is a grassroots advocacy committee with more than 50 active members, primarily made up of low-income people. And we are fighting together to have more opportunity for affordable housing in our neighborhood of [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] is a member of [ORGANIZATION]."
06_30_2016,affordable housing,"And that will be far away from the clinic. But with an affordable housing, an affordable home, we would be able to have stability that comes with a set rent. Podemos tener una [LOCATION] y una oportunidad para una vida mejor."
06_30_2016,affordable housing,"I have a little different view on this. Your increases in sewer and water rates, increases in electric rates, garbage service rates, and especially property taxes all have an impact on increasing the cost of housing. Although finding more money to help pay for more affordable housing is a laudable goal, your [ORGANIZATION] approach to increasing taxes on existing [ORGANIZATION] households is going in the wrong direction."
06_30_2016,affordable housing,I don't need to tell you that affordable housing works. You know that too. It changes lives.
06_30_2016,affordable housing,"It builds back our community, health, hope. Affordable housing is making us all better. We know that."
06_30_2016,housing crisis,"Well, yes, yes, indeed it does. In fact, people across this entire country are suffering under [ORGANIZATION] of divestment at the federal level, and it's only worsening in this extended housing crisis. Yes, we need solutions at every level of government in every local city across the region in [ORGANIZATION] and back to [PERSON],  We're not the only city chasing this dream of affordable homes, though."
06_30_2016,affordable housing,"Our neighbors to the north in [ORGANIZATION] are also bringing housing to voters. The county of [PERSON], where [ORGANIZATION] is, will be voting on a $500 million bond in [ORGANIZATION], along with us, and 10 other cities up and down [ORGANIZATION] on [ORGANIZATION] 8th. In fact, I spoke with leaders in [PERSON] who tell me that they are studying the [ORGANIZATION], the construction exercise tax that you passed DATE2, because they want to figure out how they can start to address affordable housing in their community."
06_30_2016,homeless,"I assure you for the 3,000 Portlanders who are going to live in these homes, for the families who will grow up, get off to school, learn to play an instrument, celebrate their birthdays, make it through their first heartbreaks, set off for college, for these kids, for these families, these homes are everything. And that's just the beginning, because over the life of these buildings, tens of thousands of Portlanders will have their lives changed by calling them home. About 4,400 Portlanders are homeless [ORGANIZATION]."
06_30_2016,homelessness,I'm the Executive Director at [ORGANIZATION]. I'm also co-chair for [ORGANIZATION] and a steering committee member for ORG2. I wanted to come and thank you for your leadership in addressing housing and homelessness in our community.
06_30_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"Not only what I hope is unanimous approval of [ORGANIZATION]'s resolution, but also the recent passage of the [ORGANIZATION] and dedicating those funds to affordable housing. The work to craft an inclusionary zoning policy for our community, and the financial investment the city has made in the ORG0 effort and our work to end people's homelessness. Without affordable homes, homelessness will only grow."
06_30_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"We meet people like [ORGANIZATION], who struggles with a mental illness and now sleeps in our parking lot after losing his apartment of [ORGANIZATION] due to a no-cause eviction, and he can't find another apartment that he can afford. The common thread through all of these stories is people who are exposed to the trauma of homelessness because we, as a community, lack enough affordable housing to support all of those who need them. Our neighbors, sisters, brothers, mothers, fathers, children, and grandparents.  are sleeping on the streets of [ORGANIZATION] because they are too poor to afford rent."
06_30_2016,housing crisis,"Increasingly, the quality and stability of our housing is determined not only by our economic circumstances, but by our race, ethnicity, immigration status. The current housing crisis impacts all Oregonians, but due to the systematic barriers, some communities are impacted more than others. For immigrants and refugees and people of color, additional challenges include discriminatory rental practices, linguistic and cultural barriers, high mobility, lower level of trust in public agencies, and underreporting for poor housing conditions."
06_30_2016,affordable housing,"Have sufficient supplies of decent, safe, and affordable units to protect against overcrowding and inadequate living conditions. Community development plans that are affordable housing to be improved in  Employees subsidized transportation solutions and job training placement programs should be included on this proposal. Finally, we need this pilot initiative to be moving forward."
06_30_2016,homeless,"And in conclusion, I want to share with you this specific conversation that I had with my [ORGANIZATION] son. [DATE] we were driving, and he saw homeless tenants, folks who are under the bridge. He asked me as I was driving, why, Daddy, what are they doing there?"
06_30_2016,homeless,"I explained to him what's going on, and I told him they're homeless. His response was very simple as a child. Every person should have a home."
06_30_2016,homeless,"And we work specifically with homeless and at-risk low-income seniors. And [ORGANIZATION], who was supposed to speak earlier, is having some transportation issues, and he's actually my client, so I'm going to briefly tell his story. PERSON1 came to me [ORGANIZATION] as a result of being homeless."
06_30_2016,homeless,"So it's pretty expensive for him for the size of the unit he's paying for. And the reality is with the rent increases that are occurring in [ORGANIZATION] and at [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]'s housing will very soon become unaffordable for him. Rent increases are actually the very reason [ORGANIZATION] became homeless to begin with."
06_30_2016,homeless,"Thank you. There are many other people who are on the cusp of losing their housing, and I talk to them [ORGANIZATION]. Homeless housing agencies can't keep up with the demand because the problem isn't a lack of services."
06_30_2016,affordable housing,"It's a lack of affordable housing, plain and simple. [ORGANIZATION] is lacking about 24,000 affordable homes, and this problem isn't going away on its own. It's only getting worse."
06_30_2016,affordable housing,"I've been pretty involved in affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION]. In [LOCATION], I served as a director of then [ORGANIZATION], and [ORGANIZATION] moved over to ORG1, then the Housing Authority of [ORGANIZATION], and served as [ORGANIZATION] there for [ORGANIZATION]. As Mayor [PERSON] might remember, when I go back into [DATE], the city had three housing challenges at that time."
06_30_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"And third was the issue of affordability. We were concerned about homelessness and the increasing number of low-income households who could not find affordable housing. At that point, concerted efforts were made and continue to be made and enhanced, particularly in [ORGANIZATION], of a variety of local financial and regulatory tools that the council has put in [STREET], whether it be funding like an increase in [ORGANIZATION] or foregone revenue."
06_30_2016,affordable housing,"We have graduated to the big leak, [ORGANIZATION] cities, which means highly desirable and highly unaffordable. We had the highest percentage of rent and home ownership increases in the nation in the last several times. There was a chronic lack of affordable housing magnified by the numbers of people without a home."
06_30_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"For the first time, affordable housing and homelessness are top-tier issues with the electorate. One thing that I think we've all realized is the power of the marketplace and that private capital actually makes public capital pale in comparison. And basically the public sector can work on the margins of those markets [STREET]."
06_30_2016,affordable housing,"Everybody needs to be part of the solution. Affordable housing, indeed, local public housing, is important to be a permanent piece of our community infrastructure. Thank you."
06_30_2016,homeless,"I do support this measure, but I do have some concerns. Okay. One of the concerns I have is that I wanted to see if, as you know, [ORGANIZATION] is trying to develop that homeless campus, if some of the funding from this could be utilized to purchase the land and also some of the cost."
06_30_2016,homeless,"If you don't take that report seriously, I think this bond will fail. So understand when the public is making suggestions on where they might want to see things happen, to have that homeless campus amendment in this bond  could possibly pass this if not i think it'll fail because the public has spoken on this dhm data now pertaining to [ORGANIZATION] in buying used apartments with this money i absolutely disagree with you knowing [ORGANIZATION] i know most of his rents are going to be market rate rents And what you're going to end up doing is removing a tremendous amount of people out of those units, and you're going to put a lot of stress on them by doing that."
06_30_2016,homeless; homelessness,"I think you need to focus on developing new, making more inventory out in the marketplace, comparing  Stop competing with the private sector and driving up the rents. Stop doing that. We need more inventory, and if you focus on that homeless campus and the additional units you can build new, I think you're going to be in great position pertaining to the homelessness situation."
06_30_2016,homelessness,Our organization is 100% behind this. This is a great prevention effort. This is obviously not an end to homelessness.
06_30_2016,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] appreciates the efforts that [PERSON] is considering to fund the building and maintenance of affordable housing, including the new excise tax on development expected to raise $8 million DATE0 and this proposed general obligation bond for over $250 million. We support this. this bond and hope that you will move it to the ballot in [LOCATION]."
06_30_2016,affordable housing,"There's a [STREET] to reduce the fees and interest, thereby reducing the amount of taxes to be paid, and that is by forming a municipal public bank for [ORGANIZATION] using the financial resources we already have for a public purpose. Cities across the nation are looking at the opportunity municipal banking can offer to end city debt, finance worthy public projects such as affordable housing, building and maintaining infrastructure, and or creating job opportunities for city residents. Cities currently investigating public housing opportunities include [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], GPE6, GPE7, and others."
06_30_2016,homelessness,"We are a local furniture bank here in [ORGANIZATION], and we serve the greater [ORGANIZATION] metro area. And we have the privilege of working with over 200 social service and safety net agencies in the [ORGANIZATION] area who are helping people transition out of homelessness. And we feel very lucky because we get to see people who have secured housing."
06_30_2016,affordable housing,My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I'm an organizer with [ORGANIZATION]. I'm here to voice my strong and unequivocal support for referring [ORGANIZATION] bond measure to the [ORGANIZATION] ballot.
06_30_2016,homelessness,"Where is your leadership on overturning the ban on rent control? Thank you. DATE0 I hear about another family or senior citizen being displaced into homelessness due to rent increases or a no-cause eviction, and they have nowhere to go."
06_30_2016,homeless,"We know that a huge proportion of our homeless population are recently homeless. Many of them have jobs and had housing until they were forced out of it. The 1,300 units that this bond will create or preserve over [ORGANIZATION] is of zero consolation or comfort for these families."
06_30_2016,homeless,"It literally means nothing to them right now as they are homeless. Thank you. especially if they happen to earn 61% or more of median income, a woefully inadequate amount of money considering the skyrocketing cost of living in [ORGANIZATION]."
06_30_2016,affordable housing,Yes to referring this bond measure to the ballot Yes to more affordable housing Yes to this being counted as a victory But don't think for a moment that anyone who is currently paying rent in [ORGANIZATION] will sleep any easier after [ORGANIZATION]'s vote Thank you all. Okay next please.
06_30_2016,homelessness; housing crisis,"When we are successful in passing this bond measure, we will not end homelessness, we are not going to solve the housing crisis, and our work is not finished. But thousands and thousands of people in our community are going to live better lives, more safe, more secure. Children are going to do better in school."
06_30_2016,affordable housing,"well uh we as portlanders take a lot of pride in our city and we do a lot of things right but one thing that has clearly gotten out of whack is uh our ability to house uh our residents and this bond measure is about setting off about  Continuing the track record this council has established over [ORGANIZATION] in solid progress in increasing the funding for affordable housing, and this is the step. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we've dug deep in our own pockets with city resources."
06_30_2016,affordable housing,"We've just enacted a fee [ORGANIZATION] on development so that growth pays for growth, and now we're asking our voters to step up  to the plate and contribute to help us establish uh six 1300 units of affordable housing over 600 or 600 of those affordable to very low income residents of our city and i think that it's it's certainly a challenge it's always a challenge to ask taxpayers to pay more taxes and it's never easy"
06_30_2016,affordable housing,"I was pleased that [ORGANIZATION] pointed out that the federal government used to seriously invest in affordable housing. And then under [PERSON], they stopped and they haven't started again. I wish that wasn't the case."
06_30_2016,affordable housing,A real estate transfer tax that just applied to houses that sell for over half a million dollars could raise millions of dollars a year for affordable housing. The voters of [ORGANIZATION] voted for a ballot measure which outlaws real estate transfer taxes in the state of [ORGANIZATION]. I wish we could apply a property tax only to houses worth more than half a million dollars.
06_30_2016,affordable housing,"To me, it doesn't make any sense, and we shouldn't be locating all of the housing that will be purchased with this bond measure should the voters choose to subsidize it  Those should not be going in the already low-income areas of our city. We should not be putting all of the affordable housing in areas that already have affordable housing. We should be looking where else can we put it so that it puts people nearer to their jobs."
06_30_2016,housing crisis,"Those of us in this room are immersed in this issue, but not everyone is. And they would want to know, well, first of all, okay, you say there's a housing crisis. Who should act?"
06_30_2016,homeless,"We've opened new shelter beds. We've gotten private sector and nonprofit folks to step up and open new shelter beds. And speaking of experimentation, I was very pleased on behalf of the city of [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] to accept a $300,000 gift from [ORGANIZATION] for them to build tiny houses with formerly homeless people here in [ORGANIZATION]."
07_13_2017,affordable housing,"So these are people who live in the neighborhood specifically surrounding streetcar. They're using streetcar to access [ORGANIZATION] shopping, work, school, specific for their [ORGANIZATION] needs. One of the other important facts is that one-third of all affordable housing within [ORGANIZATION] is located within the catchment area of streetcar lines."
07_13_2017,housing crisis,Maybe they don't feel safe walking home because of these unsafe streets. So I don't think we can underestimate how the housing crisis is impacting people. congestion.
07_13_2017,affordable housing,"For transit-dependent residents, increased transit times, travel times, and reduced reliability are significant. The transit dependent often have jobs in which casually flexing a schedule is not possible. Transit availability and reliability have impacts on our ability to transport our kids to and from school, to go to work, to look for work, to find or take advantage of affordable housing, and to pursue education."
07_13_2017,affordable housing,PERSON0 I'm one of the people that's been referred to throughout this presentation. I am a low-income elderly woman living in affordable housing on the streetcar line.
07_13_2017,homelessness,"The city is changing and growing rapidly. City drivers must still operate large vehicles on narrow streets, now shared with many other [STREET] users. The affordability of shelter has resulted in a crisis in homelessness."
07_08_2015,homelessness,"Thank you all.  [ORGANIZATION] accept report on the work of ORG1 and the interfaith statement on housing justice Thank you want to call up [ORGANIZATION] and maybe others from his partnership and team to report back to the council on How this unique partnership between the city and the faith community is working to address homelessness. Good morning and welcome. I  Good morning, [PERSON]."
07_08_2015,homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION] is  grassroots project of the faith community to address the challenge of family homelessness in our region. Through [ORGANIZATION], teams of volunteers are trained and matched with families that are making the transition out of homelessness and work with them during [ORGANIZATION] on critical tasks like budgeting, goal setting, employment acquisition, getting kids enrolled in school, and generally just helping the families through this very  but also often challenging transitional time. We know that family homelessness is a growing problem in our region."
07_08_2015,homeless,"In the last point in time count, the  the overall homeless population was stable, the unsheltered population declined, but the unsheltered family population grew by 24%. And we know that the utilization of services, especially the emergency shelter for families, has been unprecedented over [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON], this city council was very, very gracious and wonderful to support a resolution."
07_08_2015,homelessness,"Despite the good efforts of many, poverty, homelessness, and hunger are on the rise in the metropolitan area, especially among the most vulnerable families with children, women, and youth [ORGANIZATION]. Low-income families and individuals are being displaced from their homes, neighborhoods, schools, and houses of worship. Our region is increasingly characterized by economic and de facto racial segregation."
07_08_2015,homelessness,"The areas in which the poorest and the most vulnerable among us are compelled to live frequently have fewer public amenities such as parks, sidewalks, community centers and libraries, lower levels of teacher experience in schools, less employment and economic opportunity, and higher rates of crime and violence. All this tends to reinforce the cycle of poverty and homelessness. We therefore stand firmly behind the central proposition of [ORGANIZATION] to end homelessness in [ORGANIZATION]."
07_08_2015,homelessness,"That everyone deserves a safe and secure [STREET] to call home. We support and affirm the goals of the plan, which include prioritizing the most vulnerable, promoting racial justice and equity, and creating robust mechanisms of transparency and accountability to ensure that resources are used in the most effective and impactful [STREET] possible. We also call upon our elected leaders and public officials to take bold steps to address the crisis of homelessness in our region."
07_08_2015,homelessness,"Most especially, we call for robust measures to end child and family homelessness. To this end, we are asking our elected leaders to, one, take whatever steps necessary to ensure that at least 30 percent of all new subsidized units are set aside for people earning less than 30 percent of median family income.  and to use all means at their disposal to incentivize and leverage private developers to create more dedicated low-income units. Number two, to create one or more new permanent and [ORGANIZATION]-round shelters for families experiencing homelessness with sufficient capacity such that no family is turned away."
07_08_2015,homelessness,"Number three, in view of rising rental costs, significantly expand funding for rent support and eviction prevention for families at risk of homelessness and ensure that robust wraparound services are available to these families to assist them in attaining lasting stability and self-sufficiency. And number four, make significant investments in public amenities, public schools and public safety in neighborhoods with high concentrations of low-income families, especially in [ORGANIZATION]. We pledge our support for these efforts and reaffirm our commitment to continue and where possible to amplify our efforts to create a more just and compassionate community where everyone has a [STREET] to call home."
07_08_2015,affordable housing,"They told me that in the past, it was a vibrant community. It was a vibrant community with a lot of things for our church, but because of not affordable housing, a lot of our members have been pushed out, and so we are truly in  standing in agreement with the statement that we are urging our elected officials and to make sure that they're affordable housing for those people that are low-income because most of our congregation members are on a fixed income low income and so they would love to live and work in the community in which they worship and  Thank you. I've asked [PERSON] to say a few concluding words, but before we do that, I wanted to just see if there were any questions from the [ORGANIZATION]."
07_08_2015,affordable housing,"Nor does moving whole families to affordable housing [STREET] out somewhere in [ORGANIZATION] out of sight suffice. So the allocation of dollars is wonderful, but it's going to be essential  that the city ensure that the amenities to families in hitherto neglected areas, all of those support services, the green spaces, better staffing in schools in those areas. Which have not had the same level of staffing and enhanced programming that maybe some of the schools downtown have gotten."
07_08_2015,homeless,"Public safety means building trust, and for our homeless families, we really need [ORGANIZATION]-round shelter, a [STREET] that stays open and allows a father and a mother to put their kids' stuff down, to anchor them, a temporary base,  from which to transition to independent living. So there's a lot, really, to be happy about in the projections for spending. But we all need to work together to wisely make all of the inhabitants of our city feel like neighbors, like they belong."
07_08_2015,homeless,"And then, once they're separated from their partner or their children, they're lesser people. They're left to sleep, as [ORGANIZATION] noted, in the doorways of buildings and be hustled around by police from here to there, wasting gobs of police overtime to accomplish nothing. It's not an accomplishment when a homeless person moves their belongings from FAC0 to FAC1."
07_08_2015,homeless,"We need to find ways for individual congregations to be empowered to do more for people regardless of whether it's a family or an individual. We need to find ways to reward congregations like FAC0 and all the archangels in [ORGANIZATION], like [ORGANIZATION], that have direct hands-on programs where actual homeless people are actually assisted or even given long-term shelter. So I look forward to the mayor and the rest of you commissioners finding ways to incentivize real solutions, people getting a hand up."
07_08_2015,homeless,"There is that one iota of people getting their stuff back because they can't prove it. Even when the [STREET] ordered you to store it, they sell it. You have contractors stealing from the homeless."
07_08_2015,homeless,"and I know each of the commissioners here has represented homeless folks in a variety of ways. I know you're not frauds and I know you aren't either, Mayor [PERSON]."
07_08_2015,homeless,"But a question hangs there. Are you representing homeless folks, the poor, enough because they haven't got the representation in this city if you don't champion their cause? I want to tell you a story."
07_08_2015,affordable housing,"And I knew with our black kids, if they're from inter-northeast, they had a home beyond their immediate home. More is being lost than actual individual housing if inter-northeast isn't supported with affordable housing. Thank you so much."
07_08_2015,homeless,"One is [ORGANIZATION], which keeps many people in housing who are on the verge of losing it and knowing their rights, as well as ORG1 that does that as well. What I came to say [ORGANIZATION] is those who are either on the edge of being homeless or who are homeless are members of our congregations as well as members of our cities.  or city, and we constantly work within that context to get people back into housing, to keep them in housing. But I can tell you in just one congregation, the number of people on the edge of losing, that is high."
07_08_2015,affordable housing,"And the need to move farther out for the most affordable housing they can find. So I'd echo Reverend [ORGANIZATION]'s words as well. The key for this is for all of us not only to feel shame, but also to collectively put our efforts together and to accept that what is [ORGANIZATION] does not have to be what will be"
07_08_2015,homelessness,"And I think we're all sitting here [ORGANIZATION] with that initiative and feeling. But we know we've addressed homelessness for [LOCATION] in this city, but it continues to grow. So what I'm going to say about [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] is, it's a systematic approach that works."
07_08_2015,homeless,"The other thing I'd ask you to look at, though, as you move forward, are look at those things in this city that are not big –  in necessarily but really keep people from getting housing you're a deal with [ORGANIZATION] which is huge we're thankful for that but just look at the cost to apply for apartment we felt one family individuals or time but they pay a fee again and again and again and never get it back uh... so unified application would be helpful so people are losing that and everything is um... small things if you're homeless you often get cited for things and you have the least  opportunity to cover that so it can build. So I've had people in the congregation who get one infraction and that builds. So how can we look at forgiving and moving forward and helping people get back on their feet?"
07_08_2015,homeless; homelessness; affordable housing,"Roll call please. Well, I want to thank [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] for living up to the expectations that Mayor [PERSON] and I placed in you [ORGANIZATION] to really partner with us in our efforts because it takes a partnership to deal with the issues of homelessness and the quest for more affordable housing. Certainly many of the values that were spoken to in your resolution are values that we have embraced on ORG2  providing housing not just in [ORGANIZATION], as you were saying, but right now we have underway projects to house homeless families or formerly homeless families in [LOCATION]."
07_08_2015,affordable housing,"So these are all things that we take very much to heart, but we also know, we also recognize our limits. And [DATE] we'll be bringing an initiative to [ORGANIZATION] to leverage the private sector's additional help in exchange for privileges we grant to developers. We are going to ask in return that they include affordable housing in their developments."
07_08_2015,affordable housing,"Thank you. or they pay into a housing investment fund for us to create that affordable housing. So these are all things that we're undertaking, but working with the faith community is really essential because we can't do it all, and the faith community has so much more resources in terms of people committed to these ideals, and the ideal of taking a family and helping a family, one family at a time, is really important."
07_08_2015,homelessness,"So thank you. Hi.  Thank you very much, everybody, for taking the time to come [ORGANIZATION], but more importantly, taking the time to work within your faith communities to wrap around services for individuals and families. It is one person at a time in this challenge to help people prevent homelessness and get out of houselessness."
07_08_2015,homelessness,"I first met [ORGANIZATION] through [PERSON] a number of [DATE] when [ORGANIZATION] had this idea of organizing the faith community to address homelessness. The truth was the faith community has always been in the front lines of addressing homelessness, but the idea was to coordinate and to leverage the great strengths of the faith community. So [ORGANIZATION], thank you for all your work and your service, and thanks to all of our faith leaders who are joining us [ORGANIZATION]."
07_08_2015,homelessness,"And I want to just acknowledge that I think what [ORGANIZATION] said [TIME] was one of the most eloquent statements anyone has said on this body about homelessness and about our convictions. And I thank [PERSON] for being a champion. In [ORGANIZATION], for people of faith, there have been some developments that are encouraging."
07_08_2015,affordable housing,"That is one of our lifelines to build affordable housing in our community. And to eliminate the home program because we can't afford to invest in people, but we can afford to invest in things like military hardware. Did someone say the word shame earlier?"
07_08_2015,housing crisis,"Collectively, we need to say that the federal government must support a national housing crisis. That means that anyone running for office at the federal level has to say they will commit to using federal resources, our tax dollars, to invest in housing because, after all, in a mobile society, it is a federal concern. We cannot possibly solve a national crisis locally any more than we can solve any other national crisis locally without a strong federal partner."
07_08_2015,affordable housing,"There is now clear studies that have come out in [ORGANIZATION] making the case that families in high-opportunity areas with low-income kids do better than families that are marginalized. Well, who is against opportunity? But the fact is Commissioner [PERSON] gets criticized for building affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION] because people say, well, the dirt's more expensive there."
07_08_2015,affordable housing,"But unless we have a strong federal partner, unless we continue to successfully fight the good fight about who we serve and where we [STREET] people, where they live, unless we build more housing and preserve current affordable housing,  And unless we make a community-wide commitment to address addiction and mental health at a much higher level, we will not solve the problem. And it's no solace to know that we're doing a better job than [ORGANIZATION] and some other cities. There's no solace in that."
07_08_2015,homeless,"and we should be ashamed that we have not made more progress than we have, but we'll make it through this kind of partnership and this kind of shared commitment. One I want to mention in particular, and actually a [STREET] I believe that your initiative can help us, is one of the things that we've committed to in this ORG0 effort, which [ORGANIZATION], who's here, we stole him away from direct service to homeless people at [ORGANIZATION] and asked him to be the staff person for the city and the county and ORG2 and the city of [ORGANIZATION] working together to try to be helpful. coherent among all those multiple governments in what we do in housing."
07_08_2015,homeless,"And we've said we're going to take on one thing that, in addition to the rest of the commitments that we've made, where we can move the ball down the field just a little bit, and that is we're going to try to get all of our homeless veterans inside [ORGANIZATION]. It's a manageable number of people. We need to house [DATE]."
07_08_2015,homeless,"And I'm going to depart just a little bit to say that it's too bad when we were talking about  profit and responsible investing and the homeless situation that we didn't have more engagement from [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and ORG1 right here. Thank you. Thank you."
07_08_2015,affordable housing,"and I know that they've been distributed further beyond that original distribution as well. The three proposed amendments that you asked to be considered at this session, one was not discussed [ORGANIZATION]. This was an amendment that Commissioner [PERSON] recommended asking that we amend the section for the internal notification process to allow for bureaus to express an interest even if they don't have funding in hand right at that moment so that the commissioners in charge  reasonably agree to extend the period of time so that a bureau could propose something in [LOCATION] for consideration so that bureaus can express interest even if they don't have the money right there available at the moment  The second amendment is one that Commissioner [PERSON] raised [ORGANIZATION], which was amended slightly after discussion amongst the council offices, and this is to the external notification process to recommend...  Or to require that the city real property coordinator contact the neighborhood coalition office to let them know that their neighborhood association Affiliated with a property that has been deemed excess has not responded to the initial inquiry to try to prompt that neighborhood association to provide an official response to the notice of the property being available and  The third amendment, which is on the second page, is in response to Commissioner [PERSON]'s request to add language to say that whenever practicable, the [ORGANIZATION] and the Commissioner in charge shall consider proposing conditions for disposition of the real property for affordable housing, community, or open space use."
07_08_2015,affordable housing,"I'm not saying use properties that can be used for affordable housing, used for parks, used for uses that are very important to certain groups. I'm saying the infrastructure of this city has been neglected in the past. We have to make up that difference somehow, some [STREET], and I think the possibility to look in this direction is there, and I hope the council will consider that."
07_08_2015,affordable housing,"And thanks to Commissioner [PERSON] also for spearheading this effort as well. I'm pleased that we've clarified that there will be a subscription notification system for interested members of the public. And I also believe the amendment language [ORGANIZATION] regarding the consideration of disposition of properties for affordable housing, open space, and community use will allow the council to have the information it needs when it makes these decisions when property is declared surplus."
07_08_2015,affordable housing,"IF ANY OF THOSE BODIES FIND THIS IS NOT TRUE, [ORGANIZATION]. YOU STILL HAVE A MASTER PLAN OPTION DOWN THE [STREET]. Colleagues, I remind you that when we adopted the amendment to the urban renewal area, we had a pretty intensive discussion about affordable housing at this site."
07_08_2015,affordable housing,"And since we're trying to simplify things [ORGANIZATION], I just want to make sure I understand one of the points that you raise about affordable housing at [ORGANIZATION]. Now, [ORGANIZATION], would you correct me if I'm wrong, but...  part of that packet that parcel is a fire bureau property correct and i believe you've already either stated your intention or or we've taken some action to put a covenant on that property so that it will in fact be developed as affordable housing and then would therefore be subject to the set aside is that correct correct  I just want to make sure that we're clear on that."
07_08_2015,affordable housing,"And that's not the entire triangle, but it's at least been decided as to the [ORGANIZATION] portion of the triangle that, in fact, it will be prioritized for affordable housing. And I think I've said that in my – I didn't say that earlier, but I said that in my notes that the [ORGANIZATION] urban renewal area has an 18 percent as a –  opposed to the otherwise 30% set-aside, and this is a good [STREET] to spend that money. PERSON0, we like to say it's a floor, not a ceiling."
07_08_2015,affordable housing,"I think it could be a combination of public and private funding. We've got a lot of examples around the city where public sector and private sector come together around things that we value, and the city affordable housing being one of them. So I think we just apply some of the similar tools, but to industrial land."
07_08_2015,affordable housing,"And it has some special magical power, apparently. But the Fourth Amendment that has not been yet put on the table but we're debating does, in the amended language—  suggest that if there's a clear vision, you mentioned a moment ago that affordable housing could be a portion of it, but if we dispense with the requirement of a master plan in the event there's a clear vision that's been embraced and comes to us for approval, do you have a sense of what that vision could be?"
07_08_2015,affordable housing,"I think the simpler pieces to say, you know, listing in order would be affordable housing, number one. commercial and some residential in that order the property itself we own the small triangle that's jammed up against FAC0 and the railroad and the city owns the beautiful piece of property on the on the frontage roads there there's utilities in the [STREET] there's not good access at FAC0 and FAC1 i mean there's just a lot of issues to decide before anybody can really come together with a cohesive plan everybody keeps asking us for a plan"
08_31_2016,homelessness,"Yes. All right. Despite what has been said on previous occasions in [ORGANIZATION], we have a homelessness crisis in the city of [ORGANIZATION]."
08_31_2016,homeless; homelessness,"Too often we respond to this as if it were a problem caused by the homeless. Too often we respond only to the needs of business owners afraid of a loss of customers, of neighborhood groups concerned with reduction of property values. [ORGANIZATION] has a reputation for handling homelessness better than other places in this country, and we have every reason to be proud of this, but we have even more important reasons to not become complacent."
08_31_2016,homeless; homelessness,"We fail to respond effectively again and again because we see the homeless first as a category of people or even an abstract problem rather than as individual citizens sharing the condition of homelessness. For this reason, we invent only institutional solutions, like homeless shelters, group homes, and in our better moments, clinics and soup kitchens. We treat homelessness as something that must be treated with a universal approach."
08_31_2016,homeless,"In doing so, we fail to see that the needs of any given homeless person differ as widely from the needs of any other homeless person, as do the needs of any given citizen with a home from those from any other such citizen. We must acknowledge that any person can face financial ruin. Any child can be born into a home full of fear and abuse and thus seek to escape."
08_31_2016,homeless,"It is time that we, likewise, stop assuming that we know the category of the homeless and what they need and that we can provide exclusively with large-scale institutions and shelters instead of how we look to deliver the needed infrastructure, assistance, and public service to those who have no common qualities except for the lack of a reliable home. I have a question. Can you ask a question?"
08_31_2016,affordable housing,"You're incorrect. And it requires a lengthy explanation because it's affordable housing with funding sources that preclude doing that. But if you'd like a longer answer, we could probably get it for you from [ORGANIZATION]."
08_31_2016,affordable housing,"Okay, but my understanding from what I read in the agreement, it does state that [ORGANIZATION] reserves the right to ask for rent increases on the property. But it's a federally funded program through [ORGANIZATION], and they cannot take an affordable housing project funded with federal dollars and move it above the federal income guidelines. Within the federal guidelines, okay."
08_31_2016,homelessness,"Here. Okay, so we are could you please read item 989? Extend the emergency housing declared by ordinance 187 371 to address increased homelessness identify council powers, specify [ORGANIZATION] duration and waive portions of the zoning code."
08_31_2016,homelessness,"um we're here of course because there is a housing and homelessness crisis it's a national crisis it's particularly acute on [ORGANIZATION] and it's particularly acute in our city it's a crisis of families being priced out of their apartments forced to be sleeping in their cars of children getting ready for school living in a tent of people working full-time and still unable to afford their rent  [ORGANIZATION] we had the highest increase in housing costs in the nation, a list no one wants to be first on. We went up 11% from [LOCATION] in our average cost of housing in the city of [ORGANIZATION]. And yet we still have 1,000 people a month moving to our city and part driving that demand for housing."
08_31_2016,homelessness,"Our DATE0 point-in-time count found, in terms of homelessness, that we have 1,800 Portlanders unsheltered, sleeping in their cars or in tents or on the [STREET]. And so for all those reasons, [LOCATION] we unanimously declared a state of emergency in housing and homelessness, recognizing that this is an urgent crisis and that we need to respond. What does that state of emergency mean in practice?"
08_31_2016,homelessness,"We've launched some successful pilot projects, like opening [ORGANIZATION] storage units for people to store their belongings during the [ORGANIZATION], so they can job hunt or go to medical appointments. And third, it's meant real money. This city council has committed unprecedented levels of funding towards housing and homelessness."
08_31_2016,homeless,"And with my colleagues from [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], and [PERSON], we asked for more resources to address this emergency, and Secretary [PERSON] has advised us on how to get it done. Because of our state of emergency, our [ORGANIZATION] was able to tell the [PERSON] legislature that our housing situation is serious, and they lifted the preemption on inclusionary zoning, thanks in no small part, Commissioner [PERSON], to your advocacy down there in [PERSON]. And with the state of emergency, [PERSON] is fast-tracking incorporating inclusionary zoning into our city code, and we can also fast-track code changes to allow homeless shelters to be more easily sighted."
08_31_2016,homelessness,"Because of our state of emergency, local partners have come together in an unprecedented [STREET]. The historic partnership between the city and the county with [ORGANIZATION] launched in [ORGANIZATION]. Just recently started running ORG1 for 200 people."
08_31_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"Two, there are some changes to the directives that reflect work that's currently happening underneath the current state of emergency, specifically around streamlining the review process for affordable housing, that's Directive E, and proposing code amendments that will be coming to [ORGANIZATION]. Okay. Additionally, in there, there is a reporting requirement for the Director of [ORGANIZATION] as well as the ORG2 Director to come to [ORGANIZATION] and give a report out on the work that's being done and give ORG3 the opportunity to evaluate whether or not an emergency is still needed."
08_31_2016,homeless; homelessness; affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] and regional partners have taken extraordinary steps and made unprecedented progress in addressing livability issues associated with homelessness, including dedicating $356.35 million to affordable housing, rent assistance, homelessness outreach, and related programs. The tools provided within the state of emergency in housing and homelessness remain necessary to address [ORGANIZATION]'s crisis. Under a state of emergency in housing and homelessness, [ORGANIZATION] has established regional partnerships, $20 million investment in the creation of city-county regional partnerships such as ORG1 and ORG2."
08_31_2016,affordable housing,"We've created new tenant protections, new regulations requiring landlords to provide tenants with [ORGANIZATION] notices for no-cause evictions and [ORGANIZATION] notices for potential rent increases of 5% or more. We've dedicated over half a billion dollars toward permanent affordable housing, $67 million from increased urban renewal tax increment financing set aside to 45%, resulting in $284 million to affordable housing over [LOCATION].  $1.2 million in lodging taxes from short-term rentals dedicated to affordable housing. $48.4 million additional [ORGANIZATION] funding in the [ORGANIZATION] budget."
08_31_2016,affordable housing,$8 million from 1% construction excise tax on residential and commercial construction. Referred to an affordable housing bond to the [ORGANIZATION] ballot for voters to decide whether to raise an additional $258 million for affordable housing. Some of the actions when it comes to shelters.
08_31_2016,homeless,"So that's not on top of the 13. The 25 replaced the 13 and then added 12 more. In [ORGANIZATION], we set out a goal to house 695 homeless veterans, and we achieved that by [LOCATION]."
08_31_2016,homelessness,"Also during [ORGANIZATION], we've, as the mayor pointed out, we've been engaging in a lot of intentional experimentation. We've created new innovative pilot programs, such as [ORGANIZATION]. This is an online resource for Portlanders to receive information and updates on homelessness policies, services, and future programming."
08_31_2016,homelessness,"We started the One Point of Contact program. This is a reporting tool to streamline public reporting of livability issues related to homelessness camping,  regardless of jurisdiction. There have been on average 280 reports per week and 6,000 to date."
08_31_2016,homeless; homelessness,"And I want to briefly talk about the work that the city and the county are doing together to expand shelter, streamline homeless services, and to get thousands of people into permanent housing. But I think the most important voices that we are going to hear from [ORGANIZATION] will be those people who are experiencing homelessness or those who have overcome it. Because it is the trauma of that experience, I believe, that causes us to recognize that as long as we have men, women, and children in our community sleeping on our streets, we need to recognize that we have an emergency and do everything within our power to help them."
08_31_2016,homeless,"But I'm also proud of the collaboration in creating [ORGANIZATION]. For [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] was responsible for homeless individuals, and the county was responsible for homeless families. And I'm sure like many of you, that division didn't make any sense to me."
08_31_2016,homeless,"If a single mother was trying to find a warm, dry [STREET] for her child to sleep, she doesn't care which government is responsible for helping her. She just needs the help. So now we have [ORGANIZATION] housed at [ORGANIZATION]."
08_31_2016,homelessness,"Clarifying our roles as public servants is important, is as important as our deep partnership. While [ORGANIZATION] focuses on the housing placement and wraparound services that people need to get off the streets, that work cannot succeed without the city's work to increase the number of affordable units in our community. Together, we've been able to advance our plan to address homelessness through [ORGANIZATION], our countywide coalition of people who have experienced homelessness, nonprofit agencies, business and faith leaders,  The emergency on our streets is not over, but the action that you are taking [ORGANIZATION] will help us respond with care, compassion, and speed."
08_31_2016,housing crisis,"And at budget time, you've come forward and others and laid out the plan and the framework for addressing the housing crisis. And we've made budget decisions based on that. And in some instances, you've even challenged us to make commitments above our resources."
08_31_2016,homeless,"so uh next we'll bring up uh housing director [PERSON] director [PERSON] and [PERSON] who is uh the director of the joint office for homeless services as well as the home for everyone coordinating committee executive director  Let me start with you, PERSON2. Okay. Good [TIME], Mayor and members of [ORGANIZATION]."
08_31_2016,homeless; homelessness,"My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I'm with [ORGANIZATION], and I am the director of the recently formed [ORGANIZATION]. DATE0, when you declared a state of emergency in housing and homelessness, you recognized the crisis that tens of thousands of people in our community are facing [LOCATION]."
08_31_2016,homelessness,"You recognized that our local economy, which has improved circumstances for many, has created serious hardship for others. Unprecedented demand for rental housing and lagging supply have caused [ORGANIZATION] double-digit increases in rents at the same time that the real value of wages for the lowest-income households in our community has stagnated. This combination has pushed thousands of families to the brink of homelessness, and many are going over the edge.  finding themselves living in dangerously doubled up situations in shelters and parks and in vehicles all around the city."
08_31_2016,homeless; homelessness; affordable housing,"The declaration of the state of emergency galvanized our community to respond to the crisis in a [STREET] that is unprecedented in my experience. As [ORGANIZATION] laid out in greater detail, the declaration was the foundation for a series of new and accelerated strategies designed to address the emergency on multiple fronts.  to accelerate the creation of affordable housing, to expand financial and legal protections for tenants to prevent them from losing their housing, to expand the safe spaces, shelter spaces, for people who become homeless, and to significantly expand programs to help people who are experiencing homelessness get back into housing and keep that housing. Many of these are long-term strategies already laid out in the Action Plan for Home for Everyone, our unified community plan to end homelessness."
08_31_2016,homeless,"and among the nation's lowest vacancy rates. [ORGANIZATION] reported in [ORGANIZATION] that [ORGANIZATION] saw a 14% increase in the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment to over $1,300 a month, the highest percentage increase of any city in the country. These increases far outpace any gains in income for low-wage households and leave people on fixed incomes, like ORG1 disability, unable to maintain the housing they have, and if they are already homeless, unable to find a [STREET] they can afford."
08_31_2016,homeless; affordable housing,"These trends, along with the continued lack of prioritization at the federal level of affordable housing development, income supports, and services for vulnerable populations, explain why [ORGANIZATION], our community's information referral line, reports that they have taken more than 21,000 calls for shelter and housing-related services since the beginning of the state of emergency, including an average of 1,300 calls a month from people who self-identify as homeless. Calls for housing and shelter services to [ORGANIZATION] have gone from 35% of their call volume to 50% of their call volume in just [ORGANIZATION]. It's also why [LOCATION] and [ORGANIZATION], the average number of [DATE] residents at our ORG2 increased from 116 people per night to 146 people per night, an increase of almost 30% over [LOCATION]."
08_31_2016,homeless; housing crisis,"As these statistics indicate, there is no question that for tens of thousands of Portlanders who are homeless or in housing crisis [ORGANIZATION], the emergency is real and ongoing. Your decision to extend the state of emergency will help sustain the critical momentum we have,  to implement policies and expand program capacity to help them through this crisis. On the shelter front, as you've heard, we committed to achieving the [ORGANIZATION] goal to increase shelter options by at least 650 beds, more than doubling the publicly supported shelter capacity in our community."
08_31_2016,homeless,"by [ORGANIZATION]. With the flexibility and new resources allocated during [LOCATION] under the state of emergency, we're on track to achieve this goal, but there is a lot of continued effort, investment, and code reform needed to finish the job and sustain our progress. As important as shelter is, as one part of our response to this emergency, we will only truly address the crisis if we significantly decrease the number of people who are losing their housing and becoming homeless, and if we dramatically increase our capacity to help people move out of shelter and back into permanent housing."
08_31_2016,homeless; homelessness; affordable housing,"With the declaration of the state of emergency, we committed to achieving the ambitious [ORGANIZATION] goals of having programs in [STREET] by [ORGANIZATION] to prevent at least 5,000 people a year from becoming homeless,  and helping at least 4,350 people a year move off the streets and back into permanent housing. We've begun to build that program capacity and scale up resources to achieve these outcomes, but we've only begun.  And beyond expanded homeless prevention and housing placement services, we need to continue the focus that the state of emergency has brought to rapidly increasing the supply of affordable housing units. Our ending homelessness strategies depend on significantly increasing the supply of deeply affordable and permanent supportive housing, and Director [PERSON] will speak to these efforts."
08_31_2016,housing crisis,"We see DATE0 in the faces of the people in our shelters, on our streets, and in our eviction courtrooms the human toll of this housing crisis. Under the state of emergency, we are moving critical long-term strategies and investments forward at an unprecedented rate. In doing so, we are helping tens of thousands of people a year, and we are also setting an example for our state and federal partners, without whom we will not be able to truly resolve this crisis."
08_31_2016,homeless,"Can I ask a question? Yeah, a question. PERSON0, I talk to people periodically who just don't believe that people are homeless because housing prices are rising."
08_31_2016,homeless,"They understand housing prices are rising. They understand people are homeless, but they just refuse to believe that there's much of a connection. And I think there is a connection, but I'd love to have more statistics to give them to say, for example, here's what percentage of people who are homeless now are people who had a home [ORGANIZATION], but their rents went up and they couldn't find another [STREET]."
08_31_2016,homeless; homelessness,"So in the [STREET] count that we'll do in [ORGANIZATION], in part because you've asked this question, we'll be incorporating the kind of primary causality questions. I think we know from our providers, we know for example from our family shelter providers that a significant majority of the families they're seeing are reporting that they're homeless for the first time, that the cause of their homelessness was very much an economic crisis. We know from our providers that are trying to help people find housing that if someone is on less than $800 a month in long-term disability and rents for one-bedroom apartments are $1,300, that that financial piece is an essential barrier to their ability to get back into housing."
08_31_2016,homelessness,"I really appreciate getting more of a breakdown in [ORGANIZATION]. I should also note that the [ORGANIZATION] did a poll on housing affordability and homelessness [PERSON] and I think that their data with people in the metro area also showed that a lot of people think the primary reason for homelessness is unemployment or unemployment  mental health issues, and not very many of them was simply the rising cost of housing. So it's not just anecdotal."
08_31_2016,homelessness,"If you take 1,000 units out of the housing ecosystem in [ORGANIZATION], that's a value of about $380 million. It would cost that much to replace 1,000 units. So what you're seeing through this,  homelessness on the streets is some of these ripples, if you will, in the market rate housing, which cram people into the affordable market."
08_31_2016,affordable housing,"That's what I said. I mean, that's really striking because I think that one of the quandaries we've had in enforcing the rules we have on short-term rentals is that enforcement takes bodies to go out and do inspections, and it costs money. But if you're talking about that kind of return in terms of affordable housing, then spending a significant amount in enforcement might be well worth it."
08_31_2016,homelessness,"The state of emergency over [ORGANIZATION], and I would say the momentum that it's generated, have achieved quite a bit. But those achievements need to be sustained because as we all know and as been said by everyone here [LOCATION], our homelessness crisis remains with us. So with that in mind, I wanted to offer a couple of insights and perhaps make a recommendation or two as you deliberate this issue."
08_31_2016,affordable housing,"And I wanted to focus my remarks particularly on shelter, which has come up a few times. My colleagues here and throughout this hearing will quite rightly emphasize the long-term overriding importance of housing and affordable housing in this issue. And I wholeheartedly concur with them, but wanted to mention a couple of things about our efforts which have drawn quite a bit of attention specifically around shelter."
08_31_2016,homeless,"So the first is that the demand for shelter remains extremely strong. During [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] succeeded in helping over 800 individuals, formerly homeless, to regain their housing. And that represents an all-time high in our agency's [LOCATION] history."
08_31_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"I can't understate, can't overstate how important that is as we look at providing quick, temporary, and immediate forms of support to people living on the [STREET]. If we're going to, I think, continue to move that needle forward in [ORGANIZATION], we're going to need, in this housing market, to make very strong and continue to make strong investments in housing and in the development of not only rental assistance but affordable housing. Finally…  I think the [STREET] forward, the one comment I'd make is that the state of emergency has brought a sprinter sense of urgency to the [STREET] this community has been addressing homelessness."
08_31_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"We're looking at a series of sprints that will have to be sustained in [ORGANIZATION] and supported and really championed by this city council and the city councils that will follow it. So in [ORGANIZATION], I would simply recommend that we continue to focus our attention and dedicate significant resource in three smart investment areas –  shelter, rental assistance, and deeply affordable housing. Deeply because although our community has made strides in directing more resourcing towards affordable housing, we know that if we want to have a positive impact on the most vulnerable in our community, we need to be prioritizing housing that is affordable to those on the [STREET] looking to end their homelessness and regain their housing."
08_31_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"The rate of rent increases, the request for double and sometimes triple deposit for apartments, requiring income that is three times the [DATE] rent in order to rent a unit, in addition to other screening barriers, is not only preventing people from moving inside, but also pushing people into homelessness. I hope the council commits to not only continuing the work to expand safety off the streets options, but also addresses the affordable housing need, as well as the tenant protection issues that have been far too long ignored. Blue in the face about why those reasons are, but I think that we all understand at a very complex level that there is a growing divide between government and the people."
08_31_2016,homeless,I became homeless and found out I was pregnant. Okay. And guess what?
08_31_2016,homeless,"But you know what? When I was out homeless on the [STREET] pregnant, nobody smiled at me. They treated me like crap every day."
08_31_2016,homeless; homelessness,"My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I am a [ORGANIZATION] woman that has always been able to take care of myself, as well as raise a child on my own. I have never seen a state that our nation is in, such as this one here now. with homelessness has always been an issue and yet there's not been anything as far as the government that I can honestly see that is helping to solve the problem the problem just continues to grow and grow and grow I've been actively trying to help the homeless  issue to begin with because I always said I was a stone's throw away."
08_31_2016,homeless,"Well, the stone got thrown and I am now homeless for the first time in my life. And I've worked hard. I raised a good child."
08_31_2016,homeless,"My understanding is that the city is planning to work with a person by the name of [ORGANIZATION], who apparently it's a $100 million investment for the FAC0 site. Now, for the 1,800 people that are homeless, that's about $50,000. The median house price is about $550,000 in the city of [ORGANIZATION]."
08_31_2016,homeless,"You could subsidize the building of triple the amount of houses, right?  based on just materials. It's also worth pointing out the fact that most of the people who are homeless are women, especially women who are trans, GLBT, veterans, and construction workers. I find it extremely sublimely ironic that many of the people who are homeless are the people who know how to build houses."
08_31_2016,homelessness,"It's a notice of homelessness. I'm here [ORGANIZATION] to urge you and extend the declaration and ordinance of [LOCATION] [ORGANIZATION]. But I ask you not only to focus on getting people who are in tents or on the [STREET] into shelters, and even those in shelters, hotels, and couches into housing, but also to consider doing something radical."
08_31_2016,homeless; homelessness,"Acknowledge and act on preventing the homelessness in the first [STREET]. Before moving into this apartment [ORGANIZATION], I was already homeless. I lived in a hotel."
08_31_2016,homeless,"I can't afford to be further from transportation that my family is dependent with. And all eight of the families that occupy this building that got this notice are in the same boat. And the truth is, on [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION] we received the notice, is [LOCATION] we became homeless."
08_31_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"This is happening [ORGANIZATION] all over the city, and we have no [STREET] to go. For people in this city, this rent increase in this magnitude or a no-cause eviction is just a notice of homelessness. And you know that we can't afford, that there isn't enough affordable housing for us."
08_31_2016,affordable housing,You know that we can't wait for affordable housing in the pipeline to be built. You know that the application and screening barriers are too high for people like us to find anything. And [ORGANIZATION] is just [ORGANIZATION] worth of trauma and worry.
08_31_2016,affordable housing,"So the management company is [ORGANIZATION], and they actually blame us. They say that [ORGANIZATION] is...  a victim of its own success. And they blame you guys for not building affordable housing fast enough."
08_31_2016,homeless,"They will not sit down with us. They will not talk to us. And I really believe that you must utilize your power during the housing state of emergency, and you must protect the vulnerable people from becoming homeless."
08_31_2016,homeless,"That we need housing for homeless people, but we also need to keep the people that are already in houses and in homes, we need to keep them housed. We need to keep [ORGANIZATION] housed. And this is a man-made disaster."
08_31_2016,housing crisis,"It's also close to what we hope to build in [ORGANIZATION] with our housing bond. That's rental housing that's been eliminated for over 3,000 renters. The boldest move you could make is to invoke ORS 91.225, Section 5, to temporarily stabilize and protect renters until the legislature gives us back the regulatory tools we need to deal with this housing crisis."
08_31_2016,affordable housing,"And children in the affordable housing FAC0 can't go to FAC1, a school they can see from their sidewalk, and are instead bused to [ORGANIZATION], two miles away. How much is that costing the city? These classist policies echo the overwhelming message that [ORGANIZATION] has continued to send to the public."
08_31_2016,houseless,"If you have money, [ORGANIZATION] represents you. Everyone else can just move. This has been evident with the complete lack of action toward slowing the rapid increase in rent throughout the metro area, the ballooning houseless population who continues to be swept from somewhere to nowhere, and the continued traumatic displacement of families by landlords who care more about their profits than people."
08_31_2016,affordable housing,"It's the families in my son's school at FAC0 who message me or email me and ask if I know where they can find affordable housing because they have no-cause evictions or rent increases they can't afford. It's the family of six, including triplets, who are [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION], who had to move because of a no-cause eviction. They spent DATE2 camping in [ORGANIZATION]'s yard."
08_31_2016,unhoused,"Since you declared the housing state of emergency [ORGANIZATION], the crisis is only getting worse. One thing is clear [LOCATION], it must be that. Tenants are still getting priced out and evicted for no just reason, and our unhoused neighbors are still being forced from [STREET] to [STREET] with no reasonable alternatives."
08_31_2016,affordable housing,"I'm not trying to say that you all haven't made any effort here. Honestly, I'm not. Investment in affordable housing and shelters is important, but what effort you have made, it just isn't enough, and it isn't meeting our most urgent needs."
08_31_2016,unhoused,"But, you know, what I think you all need to recognize is that if a housed person on my block commits a crime, you do not send the police to evict our whole neighborhood. And our unhoused neighbors, our unhoused friends...  They need that level of dignity from you. They need to be treated as the individual human beings."
08_31_2016,homeless,"Since then, the office has refused to answer questions about the move, leaving residents and neighbors uncertain of what comes next. In addition to [ORGANIZATION], camping continues to increase and overlook and to cause problems. This ordinance is big on language about the needs of [PERSON]'s homeless residents, and it should be."
08_31_2016,homeless,"I know that you'd like to do more. I know that you're in the middle, and you have people that hate homeless. You have homeless advocates, and you have all these conflicting emotions."
08_31_2016,homeless,"I believe that the new writing of this homeless emergency or this housing emergency should include tiny houses. We're working together with some churches, some other nonprofits, some organizations to buy land, to build tiny houses. I hate to call them tiny houses, small structures, emergency structures that will be put on the back of flatbeds and moved throughout the city to different churches and different organizations, private property."
08_31_2016,affordable housing,"So I'm glad you brought that up. I'd also like to bring up that you know we can't produce 1,800 units that quick you know we're typically as a [ORGANIZATION] you guys are usually spending about two hundred fifty thousand dollars on an affordable housing unit We can build these we can build these time is up appreciate it. Okay."
08_31_2016,housing crisis,"I'm actually a social studies teacher of one of [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]'s children. And also, I'm an owner-occupied landlord of a duplex. And I could speak from experience that actually I just spent some time writing some curriculum for teaching about the housing crisis."
08_31_2016,houseless,"And as you know, over 50% of renters in [ORGANIZATION] are housing insecure. So even people that are not houseless yet are already insecure. And that includes ourselves."
08_31_2016,affordable housing,"Where do people go? Ultimately, we need permanent housing, affordable housing, really affordable housing, not what's for median family income of over $50,000. So that is something that you can do, and I urge you to do so."
08_31_2016,housing crisis,"I see my friends searching for couches to sleep on or temporary places they can stay to avoid having to sleep outside. Others have no other option. My household has hosted folks struggling to stay housed, and I have seen the trauma and suffering of this housing crisis firsthand."
08_31_2016,homeless,"So you can break away now.  from the state and all these stupid rules and do a little actual progressive solutions, you know? And, you know, you had [ORGANIZATION] up here, who's the housing commissioner of [ORGANIZATION], right? Well, you want to know what?  [ORGANIZATION] let me fall into the streets when I was homeless, and [PERSON] wouldn't even pay for a meth contamination to check my apartment when I was having health issues."
08_31_2016,homeless,"You want to know what? I've actually seen in the [ORGANIZATION] group, this guy over there with the ORG1 beard in the back is the head of, right? And they're talking about throwing needles on the ground to make it look like homeless drug people are using drugs."
08_31_2016,homeless,"right so I've seen that there's screenshots of it you know he  He can come up here and admit to the stuff that goes on and the fact that members of his group are out there harassing homeless women, beating up people, doing all kinds of vigilante actions. You guys don't care if there's serial killers, all kinds of people, you know."
08_31_2016,homeless,"You had a homeless serial killer, [ORGANIZATION], who got released from prison pretty early. Okay, Mr. [PERSON], your time is up. And then he went around and killed homeless people."
08_31_2016,homeless,and a homeless service outreach worker. You guys don't care about anything. You're all about money and bullshit.
08_31_2016,homeless,Mr. [PERSON]. How much money are you going to spend sweeping out homeless people and warring off the mentally ill homeless people  uh women and children [PERSON] everyone okay mr PERSON1 thank you call
08_31_2016,homelessness,"Thank you. Mr. [PERSON]. And it's crisis capitalism in work, and that's why you guys want homelessness to continue."
08_31_2016,affordable housing,"I think we need to focus on that affordable housing bond. It's very important that that gets passed. We're talking possibly 1,300 more units out there."
08_31_2016,homeless,"It's perfect. Perfect. But the reason I'm homeless again, I'm a resident at FAC0."
08_31_2016,homeless,"I've seen more and more homeless camps go up. I have a friend of mine that got housed right after the declaration went in. And [ORGANIZATION], she was kicked out of her housing, and she joined housed her."
08_31_2016,homeless,So they kicked her out to put someone else in. That's not housing more homeless. What that's doing is that's just equaling out what there is.
08_31_2016,homeless,"You guys got a serious problem with the homeless. And I don't know, you guys keep coming up with all kinds of different things and stuff like that. It's not working."
08_31_2016,homeless,"These rich people, I'll go pitch a tent in their front yard. What I've told people is instead of worrying about the corridor, they need to move those homeless people up to the rich areas up here and pitch tents in their yard. Yeah, we can do that."
08_31_2016,homeless,"But I think further than that, I'd  At least the thing that I touch on a lot is talking to our communities. There's a wealth of solutions that our communities could provide, but we have no [STREET] to provide those solutions. It has been funded to have these agencies deal with these established agencies to provide  kind of trickle down and almost this [ORGANIZATION]-esque trickle-down economics of aid to homeless."
08_31_2016,homeless; affordable housing,"Mr. [PERSON].  Girls, just give us your name and you have [TIME]. Yeah, hi, my name is [PERSON], and I'm a homeless advocate. I just want to say in [ORGANIZATION], there was three of us that kept talking about the more need for shelters in 10 cities, which the  the council here and others kept saying, no, affordable housing and programs, that's what we need."
08_31_2016,affordable housing,"We kept telling you guys over and over, it's getting worse, we need this. This is a temporary solution. But no, you guys kept going for housing, affordable housing and also for programs."
08_31_2016,homeless; affordable housing,"So we're in the solution right now, or we're in the problem right now, all these homeless people outside right now. It's not caused, or some of it is caused, I think some of it is caused by your decision-making of affordable housing, not putting people into temporary shelters or like we have 10 cities right now. So that's what we really need right now is,  a temporary spot for homeless individuals."
08_31_2016,homeless; affordable housing,"I think that this should be extended, this state of emergency, but it should be extended until there's enough affordable housing for everybody, not just [ORGANIZATION], not [LOCATION],  but until there is enough affordable housing for everybody. You know, it's crazy to say we're going to only limit it to this time. Okay, so on FAC0, I wrote this poem, and it's called On the Brink of Insanity, Interreactions Between Homeless and [ORGANIZATION]."
08_31_2016,homeless,"One homeless person screws up. All the homeless people have to pay. Three steps forwards, 18 steps backwards."
08_31_2016,homeless,"That's what it's like for homeless people out there right now. And when you're doing the sweeps, that's what happens. These individuals are confused out there."
08_31_2016,affordable housing,"This is what's happening right now. So that's why I say we need to keep it going until we have enough affordable housing for everybody. Thank you, Mr. [PERSON]."
08_31_2016,homelessness,"He is a coal operator. He owns coal mines. He shuffles coal through our cities and towns and causes health issues, which causes homelessness."
08_31_2016,homeless,I'm visiting from [ORGANIZATION]. I'm a student of child psychology and a homeless advocate. I haven't been in this chamber since [ORGANIZATION] and PERSON1 ran the city.
08_31_2016,homeless,"We're going to have proven leadership again in [ORGANIZATION] as the greedy, the [ORGANIZATION], the PERSON1, the [ORGANIZATION] ripoffs, the Ponzi schemes. As we move back to proven leadership. But right now, we need emergency housing for homeless people."
08_31_2016,houseless,"It came from the actual houseless folks on the ground spending what little money they had to build themselves a little bit of shelter. So let me just ask you, why? Why are we still trusting you?"
08_31_2016,affordable housing,"And  We are trying to do what we can with this issue in the city, but we do need help. I mean, the investment we need to have enough affordable housing for everybody is huge. It's the kind of investment that this country made, for example, during the New Deal."
08_31_2016,affordable housing,"Extension of the affordable housing design plan. review process as a type 2X rather than type 3, which just means it can be done faster and has a different level of review. There's a hard deadline for [ORGANIZATION] to make a recommendation, pro or con, on inclusionary housing, requiring action no later than [ORGANIZATION]."
08_31_2016,homeless,"That is, there are people out there, families and struggling veterans and people that are homeless and struggling with addiction and mental illness, and our neighbors, our friends, our family members. We're 30,000 units short. So there's a huge problem in the market."
08_31_2016,homelessness,"I mean, we've all heard and can't help but feel the passionate concern that people have about what's happening to [ORGANIZATION]. We are becoming unaffordable to too many of our friends and neighbors, and it is contributing to homelessness. and we are in a crisis."
08_31_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"I believe every member of this council is committed absolutely to solutions to those for homelessness and for more affordable housing. And just to amplify what Commissioner [PERSON] mentioned with respect to the bond measure that will be on this [ORGANIZATION]'s ballot, this will dedicate almost half the dollars towards providing affordable housing, permanently affordable housing for people on very low incomes. and half of it will also be dedicated to family-size housing, which is another area that the market is not meeting."
08_31_2016,affordable housing,"So half of the units to be built under this bond will be two-bedroom or greater, and there's a screaming need for that as well. So I hope you'll all make sure that you get out and vote and spread the word about the importance of this bond measure in [ORGANIZATION]. I'm also happy to say that [PERSON] I'll be releasing my proposal to implement the inclusionary zoning proposal that will require new developments to provide affordable housing or to pay us into a fund so that we can develop affordable housing."
08_31_2016,housing crisis,"So that is something, thanks to the legislature in [ORGANIZATION], we now have the authority to do. As you can imagine, [PERSON] is the first one out of the gate, the first city out of the gate, and actually implementing it. And we hope that what we implement will provide a model to other cities in the state because this housing crisis is not confined to [PERSON]."
06_14_2018,homelessness,"And I know as a person of color who grew up in [ORGANIZATION], in a town where our main thoroughfare was named after [ORGANIZATION], that [STREET] names matter. They can make us feel welcome or definitely not welcome in a [STREET]. Naming a [STREET] for an LGBTQ hero sends a powerful message to our kids who still face alarming rates of bullying, family rejection, and homelessness that we have their backs."
06_20_2018,homeless; houseless,"So first up, [ORGANIZATION], is communications. Could you please invite the first individual, please? Item 658, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding homeless, houseless issues and solutions."
06_20_2018,homelessness,"It's not a lot of housing. But as anyone has known, drops in a bucket can eventually fill the bucket. It's a complicated issue solving homelessness, but this could be one of the processes to reduce homelessness in [ORGANIZATION]."
06_20_2018,affordable housing,"They have to get as much return on those properties, but they can't dedicate them to affordable housing. Well, I understand that. But I also understand that, I mean, we're trying to solve a problem."
06_20_2018,housing crisis; affordable housing,"And if going to the highest bidder just makes the problem worse, which it will because they'll  they're not going to make low-income housing. I know Commissioner [PERSON] shares your frustration because he has been working on the affordable housing crisis for a very long time, and so I'm sure he'll continue looking into that, and I appreciate your coming to talk to us about it. Okay."
06_20_2018,homelessness,"I'm feeling like a little jilted [ORGANIZATION]. Next individual, please.  661 request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding gather make shelter a citywide collaboration with the population Experiencing homelessness very good. Welcome."
06_20_2018,homelessness,"People are really excited about contributing to this project. Then what I'm going to do is take those ceramic bowls into 10 different social service agencies and teach some drawing and painting skill workshops relative to working on pottery with people who are experiencing homelessness. Those artists who are working through the social service agencies, they're going to be paid to do this project, and that's a really important piece of this project for me."
06_20_2018,homelessness,"Another event that we're going to have, and that's going to be the big public event where we sell the bowls and everybody comes. There's also going to be food there, and it's a cross-pollination of chefs in town working with youth experiencing homelessness to teach them some culinary skills. There's music that's coming on board."
06_20_2018,homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION] is the [STREET] where you can access our fundraising campaign. And...  [ORGANIZATION] at [URL] is where you can arrange a meeting with me, and I'm happy to meet with everybody and their mother and father and sister and brother to talk about this project. Not only are the housed citizens funding this project, the people who are currently experiencing homelessness have given me money for this project."
06_20_2018,homeless; homelessness,I'm speaking with [ORGANIZATION] and people from [ORGANIZATION] about the positive things that are happening in the city relative to people who are working with people experiencing homelessness to make it better. So I just spent [TIME] with them. at a different event talking about progress around homeless services.
06_20_2018,affordable housing,"So outside of the general fund, there are a number of actions described in Exhibit 2 to the ordinance. Most notable is a shift of $15.1 million.  from the [ORGANIZATION] contingency to fund the ORG1 loan to ORG2. It's an interim financing mechanism for affordable housing projects, and that's really the only major one."
06_20_2018,affordable housing,"And furthermore, we desperately need the proceeds  to be applied to the most urgent issue of our time, which is affordable housing. And there's a lot of room for how we can define the different categories of urgency. So respectfully, I vote aye."
06_20_2018,affordable housing,"Aye. Well, I want to encourage my colleagues to actually engage my office on issues around affordable housing, short-term rentals, and tenant protections, since that is the primary reason I'm here and the most urgent issue to me. I want to thank all the people that came out [ORGANIZATION] and gave very insightful and reasonable testimony, especially the very small-time, short-term rental operators who are on the low end of the spectrum and especially those who are offering rooms in their home as a [STREET] to provide  remain in their homes."
06_20_2018,homelessness,"So I want to start by saying I'm hearing and respecting what my colleagues are saying. Second of all, I do want to acknowledge that this has been in the works for [ORGANIZATION], that there were different alternatives that were explored as per the staff testimony when we heard this item the first time. The revenues being raised from this are going both towards housing affordability and homelessness, something that is a priority for this city council."
06_20_2018,houseless,"over at the detention center. They need to be removed regardless of the [ORGANIZATION] property that's in the back or anywhere else that our police in the sanctuary city cannot work with [PERSON] and that we need to abolish [PERSON] from [ORGANIZATION], from [PERSON]. Maybe you could speak to the governor and say [ORGANIZATION] no longer has any use of [PERSON] or for that building, and we could open that building up for [PERSON]  actual houseless people on the streets who need housing, turn it into apartments, and we would have a new building that we could use for a much more humanitarian purpose, including good pipes for good water."
06_20_2018,affordable housing,"I am one of the senior policy advisors in the office of Mayor [PERSON]. Over [ORGANIZATION], the City has mobilized its resources to achieve record levels of affordable housing production. With the recent addition of the housing bond and other revenue sources to support increased affordable housing development, there is every indication that this trend will continue."
06_20_2018,affordable housing,"As we continue this level of investment in creating more affordable housing, who will be able to access the housing is the pressing equity question we still must address. As the Mayor mentioned, nearly one-third of Americans have a criminal record of some sort. These records carry long-term collateral consequences."
06_20_2018,affordable housing,"Choosing to make financial decisions  to make units affordable rather than paying the fee in lieu. Each [PERSON]-application comes before [ORGANIZATION] for approval. In addition to the [ORGANIZATION] tax exemption provided by the [PERSON], this project will receive an exemption of the affordable housing construction excise tax and system development charges that otherwise would have been due on the affordable units."
06_20_2018,homeless,"Only homeless and housing issues scored higher. [ORGANIZATION], however, has been reducing motor vehicle capacity with [STREET] diets and [STREET] design changes that create more congestion, which in turn leads to engines idling and running longer and thereby increasing fuel consumption and emissions. Many of the tools in the ORG1 plan will not fit within already constrained right-of-ways without doing more of the same, and or removing on-[STREET] parking that locally owned small and minority businesses rely on, even adding curb extensions that allow buses to obstruct other traffic and travel lanes when stopping for passengers add congestion."
07_20_2016,homelessness,"Oh, she is here. Okay, all right, so let's take 832, please. Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding homelessness, closing the revolving door, a new approach."
07_20_2016,homeless,Go right ahead. I was homeless. I may not look like that person.
07_20_2016,homelessness,"And the first thing they had on my chart was shortness of breath and homelessness. Well, needless to say, they didn't treat either one. I ended up in isolation at [ORGANIZATION]."
07_20_2016,affordable housing,It could house. There's a little hitch in the giddy-up because affordable housing would have to be at the end. I never was able to hold my head up until I started volunteering.
07_20_2016,homeless,"Instead of news bits about needles and tents because a lot of those homeless people don't have a [STREET] to go. You have people sitting in TPI transition projects literally from [TIME] until 5 until [TIME] shelter opens back up. Bar and any mental, all of them need mental health."
07_20_2016,homelessness,"I'm not, you know, a lot of people equate homelessness with a lack of intelligence. And they're so wrong. And they have all these people you hear on the news [ORGANIZATION]."
07_20_2016,homeless,"You look at any institution, people get out of prison. Some people lucky enough to find mentors. And they basically, my grandson, my oldest grandchild, he wrote this thing about me when I was going through cancer, talking about how he saw me run across a four-[STREET] highway to feed a homeless person."
07_20_2016,homeless,"Because a homeless person don't need food. I mean, don't need money. They need food."
07_20_2016,homeless,"A lot of these...  I don't like the idea of picking on homeless people, saying that they're the ones tracking around or bringing in rats or stuff like that or terrorism. These things basically come out of buildings. They grow outside."
06_10_2015,affordable housing,"We're looking forward to passing a strong ban on the box ordinance, plug, in the city of [ORGANIZATION]. We're looking forward to continue to expand workforce diversity and employment opportunities and affordable housing in the city of [ORGANIZATION]. We're committed to having strong and equitable contracting and procurement policies."
06_10_2015,affordable housing,"I implore the city to prioritize anti-displacement strategies as a primary method to build climate resilience. This means more affordable housing, living wages, job training for the new economy, and a just transportation system for all. I also want to challenge the city to lead the world when it comes to climate change."
06_10_2015,affordable housing,"In [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] sited a solar farm atop an affordable housing complex. And in [PERSON], grid alternatives provide solar panels for little to no upfront cost and trains low-income residents on the skills necessary for solar installation. But that's just one of the many possible ways to build resilience."
06_10_2015,affordable housing,We recently completed our third and final [ORGANIZATION] project out in southwest [ORGANIZATION] called FAC0. I know many of you have toured it. And that sort of moves us into a new era as a developer of affordable housing.
06_10_2015,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] are behind us. And so...  We are now approaching the role with curiosity and an interest in partnership and, of course, a deep commitment to increasing the amount of affordable housing that's available in our community. We are engaging supportively and productively in conversations about how the development of affordable housing can be done more quickly and less expensively."
06_10_2015,homelessness,"And we'll be asking for help in doing it. And then finally, I'll just touch on the obvious importance of our engagement with you in the ORG0 effort to end homelessness in this community, ultimately. And I think we are on a really strong path."
06_10_2015,homelessness; affordable housing,"We really desperately need...  a local permanent revenue stream that will fund affordable housing. Affordable housing is our long-term systemic solution to homelessness. And as much as we are doing with what we have, we need more than that."
06_10_2015,affordable housing,"My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I'd like to start off by thanking Commissioner [PERSON] for nominating me to potentially be with the approval of the council board member for [ORGANIZATION]. The availability of quality, stable, and affordable housing, I think, is very important to social justice in the city and the county. It's one of the leading determinants in both physical and behavioral health, as well as...  educational achievement"
06_10_2015,affordable housing,"and i think is one of the main ways that the city can help in along with the county and home forward to try and break the cycle of poverty that a lot of our citizens a lot of the citizens face so  Hopefully, with the approval of the commission, I'll be able to assist [PERSON] in the valuable work that they do and helping to meet the demand for that good affordable housing. Thank you. Thank you."
06_10_2015,homelessness,"Good morning. Good morning, Commissioners. As you know and was mentioned by the testifiers, we have –  a problem with the lethality of homelessness, of people dying on the streets, and I was very glad to hear that that was acknowledged.  in the testimony."
06_10_2015,homeless,"So I hope that other homeless activists outside of [ORGANIZATION] and within, that these board members will be  agitators who not just look at the complicated issue of funding MFI-capable apartments for 30% MFI and 60% and 0% MFI, but also respect basic human rights so that the people we walk past at [TIME] in the doorways of FAC0  are there by choice instead of saying there's no cots, there's no showers, there's no beds available for them. And I hope you'll also continue to expand programs like R2D2. Thank you."
06_10_2015,affordable housing,"The decision by your board to project-based 500 vouchers is a huge milestone. Your predecessor was a little more parsimonious with those vouchers. And to connect the dots, because of that initiative, Commissioner [PERSON] is going to be able to deliver on the council's commitment to affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]."
06_10_2015,homelessness,"Without those vouchers, it becomes very difficult because obviously the biggest challenge we face is on the service side. The collective efforts that you and the city have done over [ORGANIZATION] to reform the VASH voucher program and to go from an underperforming to an overperforming jurisdiction, which means we're getting more vouchers, which means we're going to likely meet the goal we've set, audacious goal of ending veterans' homelessness, is possible. You haven't just closed out your third FAC0."
06_10_2015,homelessness,"If you take all the housing dollars, which we keep shrinking because of sequestration,  and we bundle them in a block grant, what will happen is over time it will continue to wither, and you will have some very tough choices to make about your long-term survival. But it seems hard to me to imagine in [ORGANIZATION] that we're going to have a home forward if we go down that path. So we're entering into [LOCATION], and I think it's about time that collectively we raised our voices again and said that if we're going to make progress ending homelessness and providing a range of housing choices for Americans, there must be a strong federal role."
06_10_2015,affordable housing,"And [ORGANIZATION], I just wanted to also, and I think [PERSON] more or less alluded to it [TIME], but stepping forward with project-based vouchers for FAC0 or FAC1 affordable housing is really a tremendous opportunity. It's a great opportunity area, and we will have some good mixed-income housing there. And also recently your commitment of project-based vouchers to our [ORGANIZATION] property that we just acquired from [ORGANIZATION]."
06_10_2015,affordable housing,"Well, neither the housing market, which is an inexorable, enormous force, nor the beleaguered citizen like the one we heard from [ORGANIZATION] who's trying to find affordable housing, acknowledges or cares about housing. bureaucratic turf doesn't matter the market cares not whether we have one housing agency 15 housing agencies good coordination or the lack of it and the again the citizen trying to find a foothold here  doesn't care either but what they ought to have a right to expect and what the market might respect a little bit is if the city and the county and [ORGANIZATION] are an effective partnership of public agencies doing coordinated work and i believe we have the structure for that now and i appreciate ORG1 engagement in that and then now having created that um  effective management structure that's incumbent on all of us, the housing commissioner, me, all five of us, and you and your board, to be very innovative and very aggressive in trying things, trying new things, trying to find more ways to address this problem with the resources we have."
06_10_2015,affordable housing,"Thank you, Mayor [PERSON]. We're very excited to bring this project forward for your approval. This will bring 47 new units of affordable housing to inner northeast [ORGANIZATION]."
06_10_2015,homeless,"They're disproportionately representative in terms of people that are homeless and in certainly greater need of housing affordability in general. So this project really, in a lot of ways, addresses those kinds of issues. We chose the project on [ORGANIZATION]."
06_10_2015,affordable housing,"So it's important for the [ORGANIZATION] to support other projects and having cash flow, it does a lot of things. One of the things is it obviously allows for the potential to support other projects in FAC0. And it also, I think, has an appropriate balance between our mission to provide affordable housing as well as our mission to sustain that housing."
06_10_2015,affordable housing,"For the record, it's not unique to this project, this financing methodology that was just described. I want to make that clear for the record. It's commonly used in affordable housing at this point."
06_10_2015,homelessness,"This project, as you know, is very important given all the data that's come out on homelessness and disparities particularly affecting people of color and in particular the African-American community. You know, [ORGANIZATION] provides about 1,600 units of very low-income housing, a fairly robust health care delivery system, alcohol and drug treatment, mental health services, and employment services. Thank you."
06_10_2015,homeless,"It's important for people. We have people who are homeless that come through there. We have people who are now on staff at [ORGANIZATION], came through there that were homeless."
06_10_2015,homelessness,"But it's no different. It's housing retention –  It's permanent housing placement over time. It's recovery, sustainability of recovery, because the addiction issues are so intertwined with the other issues that they're facing, including homelessness and issues around unemployment."
06_10_2015,affordable housing,"So I think we've, through this effort and the work of [ORGANIZATION] and the council, we will now have...  an African-American-based grassroots organization that has not been displaced and that continues to offer services in partnership with a really good partner in [ORGANIZATION]. The other thing I would add is that [ORGANIZATION]'s experience with asset management of affordable housing real estate  will be a great help to the board and [PERSON] as they enter into ownership and potential purchase down the [STREET] of the property. Thank you."
06_10_2015,affordable housing,"So to be clear about our [ORGANIZATION], so we typically get 15, [DATE], [DATE], 18 applications for all funding. So this is specific to FAC0, and one of the interesting things about FAC0 is it's not really a lot of property, so we have the only, really the only site, one of the only sites that was available for affordable housing. And this scored, this came out on top of the scoring?"
06_10_2015,houseless,"While the cohort recognizes that the representative groups  survey is valuable, we need to do an in-depth outreach into communities, especially those with, especially those the household survey may not reach. For example, houseless communities, mental health areas or folks with mental health, outreach to the LGBTQ communities. So we  Now that we have moved the representative survey forward, our communities will be focusing on a focus group plan with a goal of meeting with communities DATE0."
06_10_2015,homelessness,"That many fire hydrants. Okay, 600. A men's subrecipient contract would join to add $65,450 to create a landlord response program for veterans exiting homelessness for a total not to exceed $1,846,191."
06_10_2015,homelessness,"Commissioner [PERSON]. Thank you, Mayor, through the [ORGANIZATION] coordinating body that the city and the county serve on. plan was been created to end veterans homelessness by [ORGANIZATION] ORG1 in [LOCATION] bump authorized funds to create a landlord recruitment program to help bring private landlords to the table to assist in our efforts to house veterans experiencing homelessness through a competitive process join was selected to lead the creation and implementation of this program so this item awards that money to join great  Anyone here want to speak on this item?"
06_10_2015,homelessness,"We did a [ORGANIZATION] outreach meeting in [ORGANIZATION], and the entire joint family was there for a meeting, having pastries and coffee and [ORGANIZATION]. And they're among our very best partners in the work to address homelessness, and this goal of ending homelessness among our veterans should be at the top of the list. And thankfully, we have a president that shares that view."
06_10_2015,homeless,"I'm really excited about this. Thank you, [ORGANIZATION]. Aye. 601? Except three federal grants totaling $700,003,876 from [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and ORG2 supportive housing programs."
06_10_2015,homeless,The acceptance of this grant will support the activities of [ORGANIZATION] and non-profit service providers to provide services to homeless individuals. Great. Anyone want to speak?
06_12_2019,housing crisis,"I've said this before, but it bears repeating the lack of compliance with our short term rental regulations is contributing to our housing crisis. Whether platforms like [ORGANIZATION] want to admit it or not. Because the legal ruling that we are using to create this new enforcement mechanism did not exist when I was a commissioner in charge of ORG1, we were stymied in our attempts to force short-term rental hosts to come into compliance."
06_12_2019,homelessness,"Did you know that [ORGANIZATION] of the youth experiencing homelessness, 40% self-identifies LGBTQ? Did you know, in [LOCATION], our federal government, [ORGANIZATION], published a final rule encouraging hospital officials, staff, and insurance companies to deny care to patients, including transgender patients, based on religious or moral beliefs? Did you know, even as recently as DATE2, [ORGANIZATION] put [ORGANIZATION] ban on transgender service members into effect, putting service members at direct risk of discharge if they come out or are found to be transgender."
06_12_2019,homeless,"I like your comments. I would like to say that [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]. I would like to say that what about women nursing their babies?"
06_12_2019,homeless,"And what about, say you've got a transgender woman using a bathroom who needs to shave her legs and her face and put on her makeup. Is that, are they gonna exclude her for being perverted or something? Or exclude, they're excluding, transgendered and [PERSON] and elderly and homeless people from the bathroom because they're needing to do hygiene-type things, which going to the bathroom is a hygiene thing."
06_12_2019,homeless,"And they're prioritizing locking homeless people out of the bathroom over, say, a pedophile taking a picture of... toddlers running around in a fountain. So where's the rainbow sensitivity and where's the prioritizing children not being objectified by pedophiles and put on the internet? So..."
06_12_2019,homelessness,"I think there was a brief mention of people who might be, their exclusion might be related to mental health. I hope that we can all as a community work together to make sure that the exclusions can also be paired with referrals and connections to services. because when people are just excluded but they're left roaming as a danger to the community not to say a danger but even discomfort even better if we can help those people mainstream thanks very much if I could just add a comment I know that at least in the event of an interaction with someone experiencing homelessness, that the rangers are trained to connect them with services."
06_12_2019,homeless,"And as we know, a lot of our chronically homeless are experiencing mental illness as well. So that is happening, and it's a very reasonable suggestion. All right."
06_12_2019,homeless,"I will tell you, 50 to 1, I hear more about the homeless crisis than anything else ever. in this community. I hear about it as often as [TIME] being outside."
06_12_2019,homeless,"One item for every 50 emails we get on the homeless crisis or various manifestations of it. Yet, weirdly enough, and I see [PERSON] here, we heard very little about it. During the budget process and that sort of surprised me and maybe it's because as a council we all agreed that it was a hype You know the high priority and it was something that was important But it's sort of like we went through the budget process We talked a lot about certain things and then the channel got switched and right now I'm back to issues 1 2 3 [DATE] through 10 being the homeless crisis full stop"
06_12_2019,homeless,"Well, so too, it was Commissioner [PERSON]. I apologize, Commissioner [PERSON]. All of our homeless response is general fund, whether you're talking about, the joint office or a public safety component or a livability component is 100% general fund as well."
06_08_2017,affordable housing,"Authorize an intergovernmental agreement with [ORGANIZATION] for the transfer of $5,020,000 from the [ORGANIZATION] Affordable Housing Development Fund to ORG1. And I want to thank Director [PERSON], who has been waiting [ORGANIZATION] to be able to present this item. Thank you."
06_08_2017,affordable housing,"But this is essentially the county giving the city money for projects that we've already identified. Right. So they're originally, so as Director [PERSON] said, they were originally $5 million that the county made available to us through what they called [ORGANIZATION]."
06_08_2017,affordable housing,"There was an additional $1.7 million that was left, and the county decided that they would like us to administer that $1.7 to something called [ORGANIZATION], which is another ORG1 project, which unfortunately I don't know too much about, but  there is some transitional housing there as well. The other three projects are permanent affordable housing and the mode of our traditional projects. Thank you."
06_08_2017,affordable housing,Aye. I appreciate [ORGANIZATION] working very cooperatively with [PERSON] to provide affordable housing. This is a great example of cooperation.
06_08_2017,homeless,"The only thing I really want to address is I think I remember PERSON0 DATE0 made a comment about it seems unfair that we're providing these resources downtown when there's other parts in the city that have issues. Yes. I'd like to point out that a lot of the reasons that these people are down here, our officers especially, is because we do provide the resources for the homeless downtown."
06_08_2017,homeless,"That's where the majority of the resources are, whether it be the homeless shelters, whether it's the mental health facilities. And so that's why it's critical to have these officers assigned here so they can deal with that. Officers that were assigned to this detail –  Like during the [DATE] snowpocalypse, spent a lot of their time checking on people, making sure they were fine, getting them to the shelters that they need to."
06_08_2017,homeless,"Thank you, sir. And I'd just like to add that we have had a partnership with the city since [ORGANIZATION] to supplement cleaning and security in the downtown core, to ensure that our downtown is vibrant and welcoming to all people. Our signature cleaning program [LOCATION], which involves a partnership with [ORGANIZATION], where formerly homeless individuals are employed,  cleaned up 627 tons of garbage out of downtown, picked up 16,589 needles, and removed over 36,000 graffiti tags."
06_08_2017,homeless,"So there is an increase of $1.4 million in funding for [ORGANIZATION] in this adopted budget. That's funded by three different offsets. $750,000 of that is coming from carryover from the [ORGANIZATION] ORG1 budget."
08_09_2017,homeless,"Good morning. Well, Mr. [PERSON], one thing about coming up here, somebody emailed me about where [PERSON] is doing his next one, so that conversation went out the window. So I'm a homeless kind of like alternative energy advocate, and she actually emailed me because I'm talking, so...  I'll look, I'll email her back."
08_09_2017,homeless,"These things are useful, too, if you're looking for a job and you're homeless or something like that or low income. You need these kind of things. I want to say something."
08_09_2017,homeless,"In this whole process, I believe the worst thing people can do in a bad economy is have a lot of kids. So in the future, as a homeless advocate, I support [ORGANIZATION]. And I support Governor [PERSON]."
08_09_2017,homeless,"And it has general delivery for travelers and the homeless. It has good parking off-[STREET], etc. And  We're asking for a public hearing so that [ORGANIZATION] will testify about what they're thinking about, what their plan's on, and that the public can weigh in."
08_09_2017,affordable housing,"Call 883. Authorize the purchase of certain real property located at [ADDRESS] at a price not to exceed $3,720,000 to develop affordable housing. And do we have somebody from [ORGANIZATION] who would like to discuss 883?"
08_09_2017,homeless; houseless,"One of them is about a homeless veteran who has been living in [ORGANIZATION], a homeless village here in [PERSON].  who came out from the [STREET] and found her community and finally become a community advocate for the homeless, houseless population. One film is about [ORGANIZATION], a young woman who works as a community ambassador. They're trying to, I guess, represent the community in a broader context and community."
08_09_2017,homeless; homelessness,"Colleagues, this is a joint venture between [ORGANIZATION] and FAC1. This would be new construction of a 15-unit multifamily rental property that will house former foster youth who have aged out of the foster care system and may be homeless or facing homelessness, possibly with a dependent. This is a companion project to the successful intergenerational [ORGANIZATION] project nearby."
08_09_2017,homelessness,"We set out too many years ago to find a creative and effective [STREET] to address the tragedy of young people in our community transitioning out of foster care into homelessness. In that time, those challenges have only gotten worse. I know just last night that we, in [ORGANIZATION], we had young people in foster care sleeping in motel rooms because [ORGANIZATION] doesn't have placements for them."
08_09_2017,affordable housing,"And we repeatedly see young people aging out of our system without the skills or community relationships they need and without access to safe, stable, and affordable housing. FAC0 is not only a public-private sector housing development partnership. but it represents the coming together of FAC1 and their multi-generational housing community of elders and adopted families, and FAC2, and our rich array of support services for transition-age youth."
08_09_2017,affordable housing,"The power they'll bring together is amazing. Thank you so much for once again believing in an innovative, affordable housing model to solve a social issue in our city and in our state. The power of our two organizations coming together is a testament to how serious our boards are about helping to be a part of this solution."
08_09_2017,affordable housing,"And we heard the concept a lot about the missing middle housing concept. The housing that's missing for affordable housing in neighborhoods. And this is, FAC0 is, and I know my colleagues Commissioner [PERSON] and Mayor [PERSON] will get their fair share of that middle housing, missing middle housing concept because there's more to come."
08_09_2017,affordable housing,"Okay. Authorize the purchase of certain real property located at [ADDRESS] at a price not to exceed $3,720,000 to develop affordable housing. Colleagues, this property at 3000 Southeast..."
08_09_2017,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] is large and ORG1 anticipates up to 300 units of affordable housing and homeownership opportunities that can be built here. The property has a relatively close-in location. It has good access to transit and it neighbors ORG2, making it ideal for families with students."
08_09_2017,affordable housing,"We're using all the tools available to help us move on addressing housing affordability, in this case funding from hotels and short-term rentals. We could use bond proceeds to develop the property if it meets the final criteria that you will vote on in the not-too-distant future.  stakeholders in [ORGANIZATION] have been working diligently on those criteria. We could also bring other resources to the table for affordable housing."
08_09_2017,homelessness,"The most innovative part of this particular proposal is that while it's being permitted, we can use the space temporarily as shelter space. And I've directed [ORGANIZATION] to pursue this option with [ORGANIZATION] and the county. Ultimately, to address our affordability crisis, we have to use all the tools available, and this is one example of how we can move forward together."
08_09_2017,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] is really quite distinguished amongst cities nationwide, especially on [ORGANIZATION], in that we are harnessing the sharing economy and the value created through the short-term rental platforms and redirecting that money to mitigate the loss of affordable housing. The inevitability of the sharing economy is such that we, frankly, as a city, decided that we weren't going to forestall it. They're active in every country, really."
08_09_2017,affordable housing,"So we began looking [ORGANIZATION] for appropriate properties that were large enough to hold significant property. investment in affordable housing. This particular site has been the location of [ORGANIZATION], one of 54 strip clubs in [ORGANIZATION]."
08_09_2017,affordable housing,"Yes, my name is [ORGANIZATION]. I represent [ORGANIZATION] Super Watchdog X. At first –  I originally thought this was going to be purchased off the affordable housing bond, but I can see that is not the case."
08_09_2017,affordable housing,"Again, I like the numbers that I'm seeing as far as your –  projecting out maybe 100 to 300 affordable housing units. Again, I want to have a clear understanding when these projects are being presented, is one of the main focuses I want to see on these type of projects is how many jobs will be created when we do these projects. Because a lot of times on presentations, I don't hear that."
08_09_2017,affordable housing,"One question I might pose is that on the new development, can that be funded by the affordable housing bond, or do you plan on using financing from other areas? I'm not quite sure on that yet. I'll wait to possibly hear the answer."
08_09_2017,affordable housing,"I guess my only question was why was this not on the regular agenda? Because it's – It should have been on the regular agenda, and that's one of the reasons it's been pulled. Director [PERSON] – and frankly, I want these on the regular agenda because there is a narrative out there in the community that we're blowing off affordable housing."
08_09_2017,homeless,"Is it the intent to use the building itself for the shelter? Yes, it is. We've been working with [ORGANIZATION]."
08_09_2017,affordable housing,"PERSON0? Well, what's not to like about this? It takes lodging tax.  which is paid for by visitors, and I think all Oregonians like the idea of visitors paying us taxes, and we're taking that tax money and investing it in affordable housing and providing for a shelter as an interim use."
08_09_2017,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], with all due respect to [ORGANIZATION] and the impact it will have on your employees, this is something that 300 units of affordable housing with a shelter as an interim use, as we all know, are sorely needed in our city at this time. And I'm very happy to support this project. Aye."
08_09_2017,affordable housing,"You, [PERSON]? Well, I certainly don't relish the idea of the city putting anyone out of business and decreasing jobs. But the reality is we're so far behind on our demand for affordable housing."
08_09_2017,affordable housing,And I'm assuming that this particular lot is really our...  or most economic chance at creating affordable housing in this neighborhood. So I vote aye. PERSON0.
08_09_2017,homeless,"Colleagues, I am very proud of the budget that we passed as a council [ORGANIZATION]. It's no surprise to anybody that [ORGANIZATION] is in the midst of a housing and homeless emergency. We're in need of infrastructure and [STREET] upgrades and replacements, and this budget prioritized addressing these issues with record investments that we collectively made."
08_09_2017,affordable housing,"We made another decision around affordable housing investments over other popular programs within [ORGANIZATION]. We had to shift resources. So...  Really, it's not about not listening."
08_09_2017,affordable housing,"It's been a long time since I've seen it. The second thing, just tell me what affordable housing is. I sure can't figure out what it is."
08_09_2017,affordable housing,"We just can't find the money. Well, leverage some of that money and do a bond, like they just did on affordable housing. You didn't even try to save this program."
07_19_2017,houseless,"They constantly harass houseless, people of color, women, protesters, or anybody who doesn't fall in line with [ORGANIZATION]'s authoritarian rule. So we're going to continue to resist. We're not going to stop."
07_19_2017,affordable housing,"It's an actual insult to the think tanks out there and truly the brainchilds. Mr. [PERSON], Commissioner [PERSON], I give him the respect for the children's levy, the affordable housing bond, because he's earned it. Correct me if I'm wrong, [PERSON] was one of the people that used incorrect funds to fund some of the loos and didn't follow the charter."
07_19_2017,affordable housing,"As you will hear in [ORGANIZATION]'s presentation, parties who cause the contamination or who are responsible for Superfund cleanup are not eligible for these tax incentives. Furthermore, the incentives are designed to reward community benefits, such as affordable housing, redevelopment in high-poverty areas, and equitable contracting. We know that no one tool is going to clean up [ORGANIZATION]'s brownfields, but a property tax incentive properly used will help us move one step closer."
07_19_2017,affordable housing,"Okay. So on this slide, you can see that the general concept is that a property where brownfield contamination is cleaned up, 50% of the cost of eligible cleanup activities could be deducted from future property taxes over a set period of time. Additionally, if a property and a project fit certain priority categories for the city of [ORGANIZATION], for example, affordable housing, equitable contracting,  then additional incentives to the amount of 25% of the cleanup for each of those categories could be added to the incentive, and that would cap out at 100%."
07_19_2017,affordable housing,"But, again, as we've conceptualized here, we're looking at a 50% tax exemption on a market rate development, and then additional percentages, 25% to 50%, can get applied for priorities such as affordable housing, [PERSON] contracting, and location in or near low-income areas, things like that. So, again, we've discussed these throughout the presentation. We have economic, social, and environmental impacts by implementing a program like this."
07_19_2017,affordable housing,"Compounded by gentrification, we know that these same areas exhibit increasingly concentrated poverty. These findings support brownfield cleanup and redevelopment efforts that emphasize community benefits and prioritize areas of health and equity from both a racial justice and health equity perspective. The legislation that my former colleague, Senator [PERSON], championed, and which I was proud to vote for as the state legislature, that the city will make use of, is structured to incentivize cleanup and meaningful development in areas that experience high poverty rates, affordable housing shortages, and disproportionate environmental impacts."
07_19_2017,affordable housing,"So you can choose to require public health and community-based benefits such as affordable housing requirements, [ORGANIZATION] contracting, and clean fuels contracting for cleanup activities, and I would encourage you to do so. Remediation and meaningful development will help bring brownfield sites back into productive use and back on the tax roll. The cleanup of these sites will also remove environmental threats and help improve our built environment, particularly for our most at-risk communities."
07_19_2017,affordable housing,"Next up is [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON] is too modest to mention this, so I will. In a prior life, [PERSON] was the architect of what later became known as the 30% set-aside, which mandates that 30% now more, thanks to some changes we adopted in [ORGANIZATION], but a minimum of 30% of urban renewal funds go to affordable housing."
07_19_2017,housing crisis; affordable housing,"Also a little-known fact is that there was actually some pushback in [ORGANIZATION] when he came and lobbied for that. But he persevered, and we're still in a housing crisis, but I can't imagine where we would be [ORGANIZATION] if we didn't have that tool [LOCATION] to invest in affordable housing. So thank you, [ORGANIZATION], and welcome to [ORGANIZATION]."
07_19_2017,affordable housing,"And, you know,  You know, you often hear me really focused on affordable housing and equitable jobs and jobs for underserved communities. Well, brownfields are a part of that equation because that is –  something that we have left in the hands of lower income communities and we have not taken care of. We have not done our job on cleaning up those brownfields and making those really fabulous places to serve our community."
07_19_2017,affordable housing,So it created its own...  uh set of problems but um there are um there are a lot of places like that scattered throughout the neighborhood and throughout the community and i think i don't know if somebody in the room can answer that question but one of the things that i like about you know the ideas that they're talking about is that there's incentive for doing affordable housing development with these properties and that's you know again we want to we want to incent the good behavior on that so i'm like you you know hopeful that we'll see a lot of good development coming out of this
07_19_2017,affordable housing,"and i did see  The incentives for affordable housing development don't differ between using [ORGANIZATION] and not using because the cap is at 100% of the cost. In that infographic, that's what it looked like. Yeah."
07_19_2017,affordable housing,"So what the infographic showed is that for each category of the five –  you would receive an additional 25%. So if, for example, it was an affordable housing development that also used equitable contracting, that would receive both additional 25%. It's just if you hit more than two categories."
07_19_2017,affordable housing,"So if you use equitable contracting and affordable housing and you're in the high-poverty area, as we end up defining that, you would still cap out at the 100% because the...  The recommendation was that, and the state legislation carried forward, was that no one should receive more than 100% of what they actually spend on the brownfield cleanup. And we'll have a chance as a council to further discuss that when the recommendations come back, correct? Yes."
07_19_2017,affordable housing,"Thank you to everyone who has brought us to this moment, and I'm very proud to vote aye. You DATE0?  Thank you, everyone, for being here and for bearing with me. So excited about this as an advocate for affordable housing because what we hear over and over again from developers is that land is too expensive and there's nowhere to build."
07_19_2017,affordable housing,"And when I mentioned this 900 acres to a certain renowned developer in town, his eyes lit up like it was [ORGANIZATION]. So I'm going to be especially interested in how we can most strongly incentivize affordable housing. And it seems clear to me that the benefit of doing this versus the cost of doing nothing is going to be a huge win.  for the city and for the region."
06_17_2015,homelessness,"I mean, I particularly want to talk to colleagues and other people who have been involved in the [ORGANIZATION] plan to end homelessness and what the implications were of setting such a goal and then what happens to the discussion when, despite great efforts, you can't quite meet it. Commissioner, I'm glad I was going to ask you that question. I had two questions."
06_17_2015,homeless; homelessness,"First, I'll just address that. And I think the [ORGANIZATION] plan is a good example because while I was not involved in the creation of the [ORGANIZATION] plan, the goal was to end homelessness among chronically homeless individuals. Over a [ORGANIZATION] period, we moved 13,000 chronically homeless individuals off the streets into homes."
06_17_2015,homelessness,"And by any measurement, that was an enormous success. And yet at [ORGANIZATION], we  There was a lot of commentary in our community that somehow we had failed because we have not conquered homelessness. And my view of that is that we haven't conquered poverty either."
06_17_2015,affordable housing,And the direction from the council is that we very much focus on achieving our affordable housing goals and preservation goals. But that work hasn't been completed yet. So we're...
06_17_2015,affordable housing,Yes. Mm-hmm. And I've had conversations with Commissioner [PERSON] about the possibility of using our dollars in the affordable housing fund arena.
06_17_2015,affordable housing,"Knowing your passion for affordable housing, you might not even be too upset if we required an additional amount. I think it's great. So I just wanted to add, too, that this is in the central city, so the site is subject to design review, and so the final FAR and height would be evaluated as part of a land use review when the proposal actually comes in."
06_17_2015,affordable housing,Questions? I just wanted to check before you could. Is there any more certainty that you can put into your pledge about the affordable housing fee in lieu?
06_17_2015,affordable housing,"The code provides for an applicant to use an FAR bonus for affordable housing or payment into this affordable housing fund. You pay $21.70 per square foot. And if you did the math for this particular block, it would work out to, in round numbers, $380,000 for one FAR, one additional floor, I think is the easiest [STREET] to look at that."
06_17_2015,homeless,It's excellent. It was opened in [ORGANIZATION] right when I was homeless and now I'm on the ORG0-VASC program. I have locked horns with the ORG1 leader who thinks that this would attract homeless people.
06_17_2015,homeless,I don't agree. You should process homeless people there. I'm going to renew my membership and challenge the guy.
06_17_2015,homeless,"In other words, he's willing to accept that, but not the fact that this facility would conjugate homeless people, right? Right. FAC0 has an excellent array of solar panels on top, passive solar."
06_17_2015,homeless,"It isn't because it's very exclusive. And this is a good thing. My personal view that we should try to remove people, homeless people, from here, [ORGANIZATION], and put them into [LOCATION]."
06_17_2015,homeless,"And to give leeway to people that are smoking the carcinogenic smoke is kind of intellectually dishonest on a medical platform. Also...  This will disproportionately affect poor, homeless folks, people of color, regardless of how you're trying to make it sound good. Because I'll tell you what, you've got everything in [STREET] with this."
08_10_2016,homeless,"Let's take item number 920, please. Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding an exchange between a city worker and an African-American homeless man. Good morning."
08_10_2016,homeless,"And I was there to stand up for a man who could not stand up for himself. I stood five feet from a homeless man that said not one word while describing my discontent of the employee's behavior. Right as I was leaving, the employee said, I'm sorry you and your daughter had to hear that."
08_10_2016,homeless,"What I wanted him to say was, I'm sorry for my behavior. On [ORGANIZATION], I called the number on the truck to report verbal violence and profanity that I witnessed from the city employee to a homeless man who appeared to struggle with a mental disability. I spoke to a man named [ORGANIZATION] and described the behavior and told him I wanted to talk to his employee supervisor."
08_10_2016,homeless,"And when he called me back, he said he did check with the employee about the incident. And he told me that the employee told him that the homeless man had a gun. And that was why he acted the [STREET] he did."
08_10_2016,homeless,You're getting sued over the [STREET] you treat homeless people. It's embarrassing. Thank you.
08_10_2016,affordable housing,"Community land trusts are the backbone of this effort. Community land trusts are the path towards permanent long-term affordable housing. Community land trusts can buy existing single-family homes, build new ADUs on these lots, and preserve them as affordable housing for [ORGANIZATION] to come."
08_10_2016,homeless; affordable housing,"Secondly, we have before us a grant application to [ORGANIZATION] for $100,000 to assist with the pre-development analysis to determine the feasibility of using this site for a homeless service center campus, as well as for transitional and affordable housing. Over [ORGANIZATION], this city council has taken tremendous strides to assist the homeless members of our community. We've strengthened our commitment to homeless services in a new partnership with [ORGANIZATION],  adding $20 million DATE1 to our efforts."
08_10_2016,affordable housing,"This council has also increased its commitment to what we all know is the long-term solution to this crisis, and that is more affordable and supportive housing. We've established a construction excise tax, dedicated transient lodging taxes from short-term rentals to constructing affordable housing. We've increased our urban renewal funds committed to affordable housing,  and we've referred for voter approval an affordable housing bond measure for [ORGANIZATION]."
08_10_2016,homelessness,"When the city and the county originally created [ORGANIZATION], we had aspirations of being able to engage the private sector in a meaningful [STREET] in helping to solve this humanitarian crisis of homelessness in our community. And [ORGANIZATION], we have that opportunity, that promise of commitment from a prominent local developer, Mr. [PERSON]. Thank you."
08_10_2016,homelessness,DATE0 we can take the first step toward achieving what I believe can be an opportunity to truly change the landscape in terms of getting people experiencing homelessness permanently housed by tapping into private sector resources. The use of FAC0 as a privately funded shelter is the start to that relationship. The resolution DATE1 provides the use of the site for a temporary shelter for DATE2 –  utilizing a vacant city-owned property.
08_10_2016,homelessness,"It will allow hundreds of people experiencing homelessness the option to sleep in safety and security, indoors, with access to bathrooms, showers, and facilities. In our work with the county, [ORGANIZATION], through [ORGANIZATION], we have added 475 shelter options, but we still have more than 1,[ADDRESS] by the time the weather changes."
08_10_2016,homeless,"Based on our calculations, the fair market rent for the full FAC0 site is $1.2 million a year. While Commissioner [PERSON]'s resolution does not specify which part of the site [ORGANIZATION] intends to lease, if the proposal is for the warehouse and the fenced asphalt yard, we estimate the fair market [ORGANIZATION] rent at approximately $1 million. But because [PERSON] and I have a significant disagreement about what is an appropriate rent to reimburse our ratepayers for this asset, and because it is illegal for ratepayers to subsidize a [INSTITUTION], I am proposing that ORG1 engage a third-party professional to determine the fair market rent for whatever portion of the site Commissioner [PERSON] or [ORGANIZATION] or whomever proposed to use."
08_10_2016,homeless,"And then I have a question. By the [STREET], I'll second that because Commissioner [PERSON], in your opening remarks, you said this would be a privately funded facility, and I think we should clarify that. I have a clarifying question as to why [ORGANIZATION] is doing this when we very recently said that [PERSON] was going to do all services for homeless people."
08_10_2016,homeless,"So DATE0 [ORGANIZATION] has an opportunity to change the status quo. with respect to safety on the streets for residents, for visitors, and for homeless people. [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION] has an opportunity to work with socially responsible investors to help solve an intractable homeless problem afflicting [ORGANIZATION]."
08_10_2016,homeless,"This may be a moment in time, a singular opportunity. [ORGANIZATION]'s point-in-time count of homeless people in [ORGANIZATION] is over 1,000.  found 1,887 unsheltered people. With some 521 DATE1 shelter beds available, we were able to serve 28% of our need."
08_10_2016,homeless,"In comparison, using the same metrics and data sources, [ORGANIZATION] is serving 74% of the need, [PERSON] serving 47% of the need. The unsheltered homeless of [ORGANIZATION] and the real and persistent needs of over 1,800 people have driven the city and our shelter homeless partners  many of which are legacy partners like [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, and [PERSON], to more than double the supply of permanent supportive housing and increase resources for rapid rehousing, all of which you approved as a council, from about 1,900 in [ORGANIZATION] to over 5,000 in [LOCATION]. Indeed, our sheltered population of vulnerable men, unsheltered population of men,  of vulnerable men, women, and families would have been much greater, at least double over what it has been, had you not made those investments."
08_10_2016,homeless,"The continuing commitment to do a better job of serving the homeless and increasing safety on the streets was the impetus behind the creation of [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON], the regional partnership to guide policy and programming for the homeless and people at risk, has set a goal to reduce the homeless by 50% in [ORGANIZATION]. The proposal before you [PERSON] is a private initiative using largely private resources to help us meet that goal."
08_10_2016,homeless,It can't be solved and you guys should not have to try to solve it all yourself. Our homeless and  It's our problem. It's a community problem.
08_10_2016,houseless,"Thank you for allowing me to speak. For the record, my name is [ORGANIZATION], and I'm here to urge the council to approve without amendment the two proposals put forward by Commissioner [PERSON] on the subject of FAC0 and the use of that land and structure as a pilot shelter  and service center to accommodate 400 houseless persons in [ORGANIZATION]. I've been working with [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION], and dozens of community organizations and leaders over [ORGANIZATION] seeking to develop the facilities necessary to accommodate 400 people of the more than 1,800 unsheltered persons in [ORGANIZATION] [TIME] and into [LOCATION]."
08_10_2016,affordable housing,"I have had the privilege of serving as [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] Director, as Chief Planner, Director of the [ORGANIZATION] Development Commission. I mention this because during [ORGANIZATION] of service, I was witness to the full range of challenges facing our community, as well as opportunities. And I can say without hesitation that the problem of houselessness and the very serious lack of affordable housing and the continuing rise in housing costs is by far significant."
08_10_2016,houseless,"These were people in the private sector who stepped up to challenges.  who raised the money, committed the funds, and did the work necessary to do the great things that were done, have been done in [ORGANIZATION] and laid the groundwork for an incredible [STREET]. When compared to the compelling necessity to house the houseless on a site immediately bordering [ORGANIZATION], people who need our attention, self-enhancement, and the ability to regain empowerment and management of their lives seems to me should be our number one priority in the city. I entreat the council to adopt, in partnership with the county, a point of view which, to coin a phrase, is a city must be judged by the [STREET] it treats its houseless, those without homes, or the means to regain the dignity, health, and shelter that most of us enjoy."
08_10_2016,homeless; homelessness,"They are an opinion offered by [ORGANIZATION], which has an executive committee,  [ORGANIZATION], which we have tasked with actually overseeing our homeless services, and [PERSON], who has been taking the lead in our community on addressing homelessness and whose office ORG2 resides. Do you have or will we [ORGANIZATION] during this presentation get an official position from [PERSON], ORG2, or a home for everyone? I can't speak for the three."
08_10_2016,houseless,"Mr. [PERSON], what's your objection to having a third party established fair market rent? My objection is that we're not looking at the rental market and for-profit valuation terms. We're looking at it in order to provide a facility that would serve 400 houseless people in the short run."
08_10_2016,homelessness,"Yes. First of all, Mr. [PERSON], I really appreciate your increased dedication to helping with the problem of homelessness. I remember DATE0, well, we had a hearing in this chamber proposing to move FAC0 to FAC1, and you and your company gave money so that we could find another [STREET], and I appreciate that."
08_10_2016,housing crisis,"Go ahead, Commissioner. Thank you, Commissioner. Mayor, I take very seriously the charge that in the area of addressing our housing crisis, collectively, our goal is not to get to no, but is to get to yes."
08_10_2016,homeless,"So let's not act like [ORGANIZATION] is [LOCATION] we can address this. To my knowledge, we haven't even undertaken that process. And by the [STREET],  In that process, I would hope that homeless people are at the table guiding the decision-making because I have yet to hear from a single person in the community who has said that they intend to move from outer southeast along a natural area to an unsafe industrial district for purposes of temporary shelter."
08_10_2016,homeless,"And the homeless are going to be all right too. And nobody's going to die of hypothermia [ORGANIZATION]. And no one's going to plant anything in my bag like a corkscrew, [ORGANIZATION]."
08_10_2016,homeless,"and I don't drink. At [TIME], [ORGANIZATION], I don't know about you, but we have asked you to resign and we shall ask it again. All 59 of us resign for the O'Day shooting and resign for the failure of the homeless development racket crisis."
08_10_2016,homeless,Commissioner [PERSON] and [PERSON] have suggested FAC0 as a site for [INSTITUTION]. We appreciate their dedication to finding a solution. But my daughter and I believe a better facility exists in FAC1 at the unused FAC2.
08_10_2016,homeless,"Currently, the new [ORGANIZATION] has yet to offer a coordinated shelter program to screen, treat, employ, and transition the homeless into housing and self-sufficiency. We believe [ORGANIZATION] can be a model for a successful program that is in use currently in [ORGANIZATION], GPE2. A recent editorial in [ORGANIZATION] says, quote, if the city is looking for an unused building that would require very few modifications, it should push GPE3 to free up space in the Mossbald [ORGANIZATION] Jail."
08_10_2016,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] is county-owned and its use would fulfill a public need as defined by the bond measure used to build it. Number two, operating costs. On [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] told neighbors at the FAC0 meeting that [ORGANIZATION] has $31.2 million to serve 1,100 beds for [LOCATION]."
08_10_2016,homeless,"Again, all of [ORGANIZATION] concerns about the use of [ORGANIZATION] have been debunked with facts that are there on your sheet before you. And I would just ask for you to give it serious consideration and do what Commissioner [PERSON] has advocated, which is work together. with multiple governmental agencies to help provide a safe and secure [STREET] for homeless and treat and meet their needs, which are an array of them."
08_10_2016,homeless,"DATE0, we were walking our dogs, and there was a man with a hunting knife walking our front waterfront porch. We've had our doorbells ringing in the middle of the night to find mentally unstable homeless citizens on the front porch. Across the [STREET] recently, there was a camp, a small camp, where they uncovered about three rifles."
08_10_2016,houseless,"Additionally, high concentrations of mentally unstable and houseless citizens is not a proven formula. [ORGANIZATION] or our own backyard here in [ORGANIZATION], we call it the [STREET] of terror in this city. [PERSON], harassment, theft, and criminal, I urge you to please vote no for this inhumane, irresponsible, and unsafe idea for [ORGANIZATION]."
08_10_2016,homeless,Have you determined the legal liability of the city council making a decision to put a [INSTITUTION] on such a site? Why this lot?  There's a lot a half mile away that has less economic value at FAC0. Is there a reason?
08_10_2016,homelessness,"How serious are you about creating jobs to prevent future homelessness if you're willing to disregard a key point behind the comprehensive plan? With bids scheduled to come in [ORGANIZATION], why are we having this discussion now? You do realize that an 8% return on a $12 million investment deferred [ORGANIZATION] could actually pay for 50 units and 100 people would be off the streets DATE2 just from the interest alone."
08_10_2016,homeless,"People's lives are worth you taking the time to manage the implications of the decisions you're making. We realize that you think you're helping, but the homeless and the citizens of [ORGANIZATION] aren't a social experiment to test the hypotheses that hasn't been vetted. If [PERSON] is sincere about helping the homeless and building the equivalent of FAC0, can it happen at a [STREET] that doesn't have the immediate economic potential and environmental complexities of FAC1?  Thank you for your time."
08_10_2016,homeless,"alone would put us in a precarious and disastrous situation. I carefully selected this location for our lives because of the safety and remarkable family-friendly features of this property. When I signed my commitments [ORGANIZATION], there was no suggestion that there would be new neighbors of 500 to potentially 1,700 sex offenders, homeless, drug addicts in our immediate space."
08_10_2016,homelessness,"My child does not understand the complexities of alcohol addiction, drug addiction, mental instability, and homelessness. To her, everyone is a friend. She trusts everyone without prejudice, without discrimination."
08_10_2016,homeless,"Me and my partner are current homeowners in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood. We have approximately two blocks from FAC0 site and have concerns about the physical safety of the area for the homeless persons, particularly those with severe persistent mental illness. I believe the city is assuming significant liability for the safety of the homeless without having done due diligence in investigating the immediate areas surrounding FAC0."
08_10_2016,homeless,"Since moving to our current home [ORGANIZATION], I've witnessed many instances finding myself concerned for the safety of homeless in our area. One such episode was a homeless man's bicycle trailer being run over by an [ORGANIZATION] train. He ignored the barriers, signals indicating the train was coming."
08_10_2016,homeless,"I also watched a mentally ill woman attempt to climb over the railing outside our house with an easy 40-50 foot drop that would have undoubtedly killed her had we not intervened. Our concern is the proximity to the open railroad tracks, which present a clear and apparent danger to any homeless person suffering from substance dependence or severe persistent mental illness.  who either do not perceive physical danger or who, in fact, attempting suicide. These physical dangers are within a half block from the terminal on site."
08_10_2016,homeless,"Additionally, there is a major substation directly across the [STREET] from the site and multiple active construction sites with flimsy fences nearby, which could also pose physical risk to persons with mental illness. The more homeless people that are concentrated in this area, the higher the risk of major accidents, including loss of life, which in this  location is inevitable. The safety risk is made worse by environmental toxins that have been identified in the space."
08_10_2016,homeless,"The  including soil sampling, removal of contaminated soil, and retesting. While [ORGANIZATION] finds itself in a homeless crisis, appropriate protection of the homeless people being sheltered must be considered. This is a process that cannot be rushed without jeopardizing the health of the homeless being warehoused in this space."
08_10_2016,homeless,"We can already feel the pressure of additional traffic and see our walkways being used to get to and from the river. But what happens when our small community doubles, and then doubles again in size? The proposal is suggesting a potential 1,400 homeless be housed at FAC0, more than one for every citizen in our community."
08_10_2016,homeless,"While they're quick to point out anecdotal stories of success, it's important to remember that as an organization, they still need to promote their facility for continued funding. When looking at actual statistics, another story emerges. In [ORGANIZATION] since opening, [ORGANIZATION] has only reduced the unsheltered homeless population of [ORGANIZATION] by 15%."
08_10_2016,homeless; homelessness,"That's 85% of the homeless population still without services, despite the $15 million per year spent operating [ORGANIZATION] and the over $100 million which went into its construction. By concentrating all of their resources in one building, [ORGANIZATION] takes funding away from services already in the communities where these homeless people come from, forcing them all into one central location, effectively institutionalizing homelessness, and magnifying the effects of impacts of a massive [INSTITUTION] in one small residential area. Within DATE0 of the facility opening, calls to police about vice problems such as prostitution and gambling in the surrounding neighborhood went up by 580%."
08_10_2016,homeless,"This was an area that was referred to as [ORGANIZATION] before [ORGANIZATION] went in, and crime still dramatically increased. One of the many reasons some of [ORGANIZATION] homeless have not gone to [ORGANIZATION] is that it's not safe. In [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] responded to [ORGANIZATION] 1,877 times."
08_10_2016,homeless,"""  The idea of a [ORGANIZATION]-type one-stop shop for homeless solutions might sound good in theory, but in practical application, it's shown to be ineffective and dangerous for the residents of the shelter and surrounding community alike. By providing temporary shelter in a massive compound and limiting resources in other areas, we would be segregating the city's most vulnerable and most in need of resources instead of working to integrate them into our community. This is an out-of-sight, out-of-mind solution."
08_10_2016,homeless,DATE0 I'm here representing 850 households created in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood over [LOCATION]. On the former FAC0 site were the adjacent neighbors. I worked in [LOCATION] for DATE2.  and am active in the community of [LOCATION] and volunteer for organizations that work with the homeless and the near homeless.
08_10_2016,homeless,"I understand the homeless problem. These are long-term, complex problems that require long-term, comprehensive solutions. I know I don't have to tell you that, but I had to say it."
08_10_2016,homeless,That's pretty cool. So...  I wanted you guys to not build a homeless building. Okay.
08_10_2016,homeless,"An immediate alternative to the proposed FAC0 mega shelter would be establishing multiple scaled connected equitably distributed shelters throughout the facility. This approach would afford both homeless individuals and service providers easier access to the  easier access to the facilities thereby increasing their reach and effectiveness while also serving to minimize the negative impacts and safety concerns with your inherent one large-scale facility on both the patrons and the surrounding community  While acknowledging that the establishment of multiple scaled facilities throughout the city requires identifying suitable locations, the city has already undertaken this process and investigated over 120 potential sites in [ORGANIZATION], going so far as to identify five sites as ideal candidates and an additional 15 sites as promising candidates. Some of the considerations with the negatively effect of potential sites feasibility include needing costly renovations, safety concerns, and zoning issues, all of which apply to the FAC0 location."
08_10_2016,homeless,"From a more long-term perspective, investigating and potentially instituting a housing first model which seeks to provide permanent housing to the homeless via rental assistance and support services has resulted in housing retention rates between 75 and 98 percent across multiple studies. These programs have also proven to be cost effective, up to $23,000 less per [DATE] than a traditional shelter program according to one study and $31,000 less per consumer over a [ORGANIZATION] period according to another. Lastly, others have already spoken to the [ORGANIZATION] facility, but that seems to be an obvious resource that's not being utilized that could also be deployed toward this crisis facing the city."
08_10_2016,homelessness,"So I ask each of you, looking at the homelessness issue facing the city objectively, how does a FAC0 mega-shelter possibly compare favorably to any of the alternatives? How does it even make sense at all? Thank you."
08_10_2016,houseless,"The economic sector is very important, and so is our social responsibility to the houseless. Thank you. Can I just, recognizing we have lots of people testifying."
08_10_2016,homeless; homelessness,"My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I'm an architect who's designed quite a bit of homeless housing and homeless shelters. I worked with [ORGANIZATION], and I want to thank him for proposing private dollars to help solve homelessness."
08_10_2016,homeless,"I am opposed to T1 for a [INSTITUTION] based on economic, environmental, humanistic, and lack of community involvement. The [ORGANIZATION] lease is going to be permanent. Humanistic, I was out at FAC0 the night before last, [ORGANIZATION] [TIME]."
08_10_2016,homeless,"There was a unanimous no from the homeless community that I talked to. Environmental, FAC0 is an... Absolutely, an excellent industrial site."
08_10_2016,homelessness,"So I commend the private sector folks for stepping up, being willing to invest resources. That's a piece to the solution that we have.  haven't had and we need, and if we can combine that with real collaboration with people who are experiencing homelessness so that they are empowered, they have self-determination, that homelessness is not criminalized, people are treated with dignity. If those two groups can get together, I'm confident that over time they'll see the wisdom that both sides bring to it."
08_10_2016,unhoused,"My name is [ORGANIZATION], and as a member of [ORGANIZATION], I'm here to add our support for concerns raised by unhoused people, advocates, and organizations about [ORGANIZATION]. And there are significant concerns here, including environmental toxicity, minimal public process, and virtually no defined details about the model for service delivery. While we urgently need more resources to address the housing emergency, real and lasting solutions require meaningful collaboration with the people who are affected."
08_10_2016,unhoused,"Unhoused people living on [ORGANIZATION] have expressed to us that mass shelters, like the one that's proposed, are not appropriate for their needs, and the mass eviction of those communities is not going to solve this problem either. Compared to service agencies placing people in permanent housing and community-based solutions like FAC0 and FAC1, this proposed mass shelter is fiscally inefficient and uninformed by the perspectives of unhoused people. Many tenants in [ORGANIZATION] are just a rent hike, a no-cause eviction, a missed paycheck away from joining our unhoused neighbors outside."
08_10_2016,unhoused,"Unhoused people who transition into housing immediately become some of the most vulnerable tenants in town here. Long-term solutions to these challenges are going to be the ones that support stable communities in our city, not temporary mass solutions that don't match the needs of the community they're meant to serve.  another mass shelter is not going to prevent vulnerable tenants from becoming unhoused policies that curtail arbitrary no-cause evictions and massive rent hikes will another mass shelter is not going to support healing and transition into permanent housing for our unhoused neighbors stable transitional communities like [ORGANIZATION] and FAC1 will i urge you to join us in insisting that any plans for new shelters be developed in full partnership with unhoused people with the understanding that warehousing people is entirely unacceptable  Also, in the absence of acceptable alternatives and alternate land for the residents of [ORGANIZATION], we continue to oppose the mass displacement as planned for [ORGANIZATION]. Thank you."
08_10_2016,houseless,"I think not as the city council, but as a city, we live beneath our privilege if we don't help the houseless community. We need to put our differences behind us. but they can't do it."
08_10_2016,houseless,"The neighborhood association, this neighborhood association can't do it because they're prejudiced they're biased, they're cruel and they're fucked up in their mind teaching their children to be prejudiced against them. Children are not prejudiced they don't grow there, I taught that I wouldn't want to move in that area because I'm afraid of those houseless people thank you  Go ahead, please. Welcome."
08_10_2016,homeless,"I'm in seventh grade, and I'm a resident of the [ORGANIZATION] community. The recent proposal to use FAC0 as a [INSTITUTION] has me concerned for the safety of children and families in my neighborhood. Okay."
08_10_2016,homeless,"Right now, I'm able to ride my scooter down the boardwalk, play in common areas with my friends, and wait for the school bus in [TIME]. I worry that if the homeless population in our neighborhood increases dramatically, I won't be able to do these things without an adult to keep me safe. There are kids of all ages where I live, and kids younger than me may not know better than to talk to strangers, which I would imagine would be all around the neighborhood if FAC0 becomes a [INSTITUTION]."
08_10_2016,homeless,"While I understand that it is important to offer our homeless population alternatives to camping on the [STREET], I urge the city to please consider a location that has a lesser impact on established community and on families. There is a children's school with students [ORGANIZATION] less than a [TIME] walk away from FAC0. I looked it up on [ORGANIZATION]."
08_10_2016,homeless,"I used to live in [ORGANIZATION]. I had to move here because with the incredibly... I had to move to [PERSON] because with the incredibly large homeless population there, I was not able to walk outside my condo building on my own."
08_10_2016,homeless,"I'm a resident of [ORGANIZATION]. We are an intentional community for homeless people, and we have been trying to prove that we can be good neighbors, that we can have a good outcome for homeless people, work as we know as [STREET] families. There's so much to discuss."
08_10_2016,homeless,"Thanks, [ORGANIZATION]. I've worked with [PERSON] and FAC0 for some period of time. After I retired I have seen what her program has done for the homeless the proposed plan by the city For the homeless is ill-conceived as we look at it now the homeless need a [STREET] to be safe and get well Not a [STREET] Convenient for city planners because developer has offered a funding the project now being suggested does not have the structure to provide the services needed by the homeless and  The planned location is also inappropriate as it abuts an expanding residential community."
08_10_2016,homeless,We have the resources to create permanent shelter and an appropriate location for care for the homeless that will make our community healthier and safer. This location is not going to be a success for the homeless population. The need to access services that will allow them to ascend to permanent housing.
08_10_2016,homeless,We're concerned about the proposed homeless facility at FAC0 and  The site is an industrial site that lies at the outer fringe of the residential portions of our city. There are no existing facilities. The site has a dilapidated warehouse and a structurally weak pier.
08_10_2016,homeless; affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] options are limited and sidewalks non-existent. The distinction between an internment camp and a successful facility for the homeless depends on resolving these challenges. Our firm has developed over 10,000 units of affordable housing all over the country."
08_10_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"I testified [ORGANIZATION] to council as a [ORGANIZATION] board member in support of an affordable housing multi-grant for the developer of four large apartments in our neighborhood. I'm working with [PERSON] as a major supporter of the upcoming $258 million Yes for [ORGANIZATION] bond measure, but more germane to [ORGANIZATION]'s deliberation. For DATE2, I served on the board, including three as board chair of ORG2, which, as you know, is [ORGANIZATION]'s leading nonprofit addressing youth homelessness at its root causes."
08_10_2016,homelessness,"The idea is the right source of resources, but the wrong use of them. I applaud [ORGANIZATION] leadership in bringing bold ideas forward for a citywide debate about homelessness. It's bold to declare a willingness to raise $60 million to immediately address the need for shelter."
08_10_2016,homelessness,"But as a shelter site, FAC0 is set up for failure. Over [ORGANIZATION], I've spoken to leaders and advocates in the homelessness and housing communities. Many oppose FAC0 as a site, but those that are open to using FAC0 say that anything, including FAC0, is better than sleeping on the [STREET]."
08_10_2016,homeless; homelessness,"Sleeping on the [STREET] is not an intentional act, but placing our most vulnerable community members at [ORGANIZATION] would be an intentional act. An act ignoring the significant contamination issues cited by the [ORGANIZATION], ignoring the lack of basic infrastructure at the site, the lack of safety on a [STREET] with heavy industrial use, missing and damaged sidewalks, and infrequent bus service. Best practices for developing shelter for homeless persons include distributing appropriately scaled shelter where people are,  We know that poverty and homelessness now exist to the east in our community."
08_10_2016,homeless,"This is why the county's efforts opening shelter at FAC0 in [ORGANIZATION] and the 100-bed family shelter on the [ORGANIZATION]-Gresham border are so important. I've reviewed the list of sites the city has developed as possible shelter sites, and it appears that many sites have been excluded for the same criteria that would eliminate FAC1. I ask why?  I appreciate the challenge the city has in working through the multitude of objections virtually any proposed shelter site will encounter, but I encourage council to reexamine the list of your sites and select options which do not expose our vulnerable community members to the significant hazards at FAC1 and deliver safe shelter and services to locations where our homeless already live."
08_10_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"I actually have built permanent supportive housing in partnerships, and we're currently working on a large affordable housing project with [ORGANIZATION]. From our relationships and partnerships with homelessness advocates and service providers, we know that warehousing large numbers of people into one space, apart from the services and support they need, is a poor and ineffective [STREET] to address this challenge. Instead, we should do what we know works, small shelters distributed throughout the community that provide targeted services for people with different needs, an approach already being successfully implemented throughout the region."
08_10_2016,homeless; homelessness; affordable housing,"Together, the city and the county. much thanks to you, has established [ORGANIZATION], intergovernmental agency focused on addressing homelessness, affordable housing, and related services. That collaboration, along with [ORGANIZATION], is producing results."
08_10_2016,homeless,"segment of our homeless population. I know that this is something that cannot be done alone. My colleagues and I at [ORGANIZATION], our company, and other business leaders across the community all have a role to play."
08_10_2016,affordable housing,"We've been involved in several affordable housing projects. I've recently offered the city a building that we have in escrow in downtown called FAC0 on the same block as FAC1 that would be less expensive, safer, and more serviceable than FAC2. I understand FAC2 seems attractive."
08_10_2016,homeless,"And there are two sites where my office is on our block between FAC0, FAC1, and FAC2.  Available on the open market, none of these sites are on the list. None. As a community, we need to pursue solutions that work and continue to support the work of a home for everyone and [ORGANIZATION], identifying sites that offer safe shelter,  accommodate the needs of different populations and provide access to services."
08_10_2016,houseless,"That situation unfortunately did not work out, so I was back out in [ORGANIZATION]. I have been an advocate for houseless people and an advocate for self-organization. If you guys have any connection with modern science, systems theory works."
08_10_2016,houseless,"[PERSON] are wrong, they are traumatic, and do not solve our problem. And I think, again, we have to look at our situation of perception of safety, because I hear it's a really big concern. It's a concern for houseless people as well."
08_10_2016,houseless,"One of the big problems, I think, in [DATE] water corridor is the people who are houseless are concerned about safety and the people in the neighborhood are concerned about safety. But who are the people who are going to help organize people so they are safe? If people are organized, they contain their own safety and their own communication system and start creating community and start creating recovery."
08_10_2016,houseless,And it's a very much bigger concept than who owns what. Because that's also a big problem. Native American people do not have houseless people.
08_10_2016,houseless,"My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I work with [ORGANIZATION] on housing policy, an organizer with [PERSON], and I work with a couple of coalitions in [ORGANIZATION] that do direct outreach and organizing with houseless folks, the [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], both of which are working on looking at identifying and developing village-type models like [PERSON] to house the houseless. I have a lot of concerns about this proposal."
08_10_2016,homeless,"It never works. You're going to spend a lot of money, and it's going to fail because you haven't done due diligence. Listen to what the commissioner is telling you and go back and redo your homework.  and get these people that are activists in the homeless community on board."
08_10_2016,homeless,"You're going to ask the people of this city to come up with $100 million to warehouse the homeless?  when [ORGANIZATION] is blowing their tops. And by the [STREET], [PERSON] is in the same position I am, but they're ugly. What they said [ORGANIZATION] was ugly, and I resent that."
08_10_2016,homeless,"I'd like to hear what he has to say to another prominent developer on how he wants to try to improve the homeless lives throughout this city. He's doing a tremendous amount of development on the riverfront. Now, step up to the table, [ORGANIZATION]."
08_10_2016,houseless,"Get a little closer, please. Hi, my name is [ORGANIZATION], and I want to just commend you for even doing the work. You know, we as a society tend to exclude our houseless separate from us."
08_10_2016,affordable housing,"I do live on affordable housing in the [ORGANIZATION]. So my grandson and I have experienced houselessness in our neighborhood right underneath FAC0. He asked me, [ORGANIZATION], that's what he calls me, why are there people sleeping in tents by the [INSTITUTION]?"
08_10_2016,houseless,"You guys might be less close than I to being houseless, one paycheck away sometimes, but I have help. I have help. I want other people to have help too."
08_10_2016,houseless,I've done work with [ORGANIZATION] being a community ambassador. So I know a lot of the houseless community personally. I see it personally on a [ORGANIZATION]-to-[ORGANIZATION] from my window where I walk or I play.
08_10_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"The reasoning for this was primarily the philosophy that it's better to get people straight into their own housing,  [ORGANIZATION], homelessness has only increased and we don't have infrastructure for them. Furthermore, the goal of maintaining a certain percentage of affordable housing within [ORGANIZATION], to my knowledge, we're very far off that goal. Even what affordable housing we have provided, I would question whether or not it is actually affordable to the 0 to 35 percent MFI range."
08_10_2016,homeless,"He's an alcoholic, but he looked clean. He looked sober. He told me it's keeping me healthy, but 80 beds and [ORGANIZATION] time limits is not enough to serve thousands of homeless people in the [ORGANIZATION] area."
08_10_2016,homeless,"But whether as a [ORGANIZATION] rental, transitional housing, or mass shelter, this form of infrastructure should have been preserved within the [ORGANIZATION] plan. To address neighborhood concerns, statistically, homeless are less violent than those indoors. From my own experience, what violence there is is overwhelmingly amongst themselves, and research has shown that even this violence increases when people need to jump from shelter to shelter, as is the case now in [ORGANIZATION]."
08_10_2016,homeless,We already have homeless people. camped out in front of elementary schools at FAC0. They're already causing problems downtown.
08_10_2016,affordable housing,"This could improve that. And in terms of affordable housing, it improves density and increases the sharing and reusing of resources. Thank you."
08_10_2016,homelessness,"Hi. My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I come to you [ORGANIZATION] as a homed person from [ORGANIZATION] who has experienced homelessness for [ORGANIZATION] life. I care deeply about this issue, and I've been fortunate to emerge from instability and have an amazing existence now."
08_10_2016,homeless,"If it's quite possible that [ORGANIZATION] will come to a census and realize, oh my gosh, homeless people can be hard to work with, I quit. And then there won't be anything to it. Then we can go ahead and sell FAC0 and we can fulfill this crazy idea that's implied between the lines."
08_10_2016,homeless,"We've just said, we can't put homeless people there. Let's grow things there and let's make organic beer there. Okay."
08_10_2016,homeless,That's what we've said. We can't let the homeless people sleep on this contaminated land because we're going to sell it to a greenhouse or we're going to sell it to a brewery. The homeless people need to sleep there [ORGANIZATION].
08_10_2016,homeless,[ORGANIZATION] doesn't want it in their backyard. But each one of those sectors needs something like this. We've got thousands and thousands of homeless people out there that are chronic victims.
08_10_2016,homeless,"My name's [ORGANIZATION]. I'm a [ORGANIZATION] resident, a small business owner, and a candidate for city council. I'm here [ORGANIZATION] as a formerly homeless teen, a currently cost burden renter, and a housing advocate to voice my strong opposition to the lease of FAC0 for the eventual purpose of creating a mass [INSTITUTION]."
08_10_2016,homeless,So what happens when we put all our eggs into this basket? We still have hundreds of people sleeping on the [STREET] and others becoming homeless [ORGANIZATION]. We have a city that's desperate for solutions.
08_10_2016,homeless; homelessness,"None of them can afford the increase, and none of them have anywhere to go. That's 30 more people potentially becoming homeless, including 12 children. Any action we take on homelessness must coincide with meaningful effort to stem the tide of people entering our homeless population due to displacement, through stronger tenant protections, and rent subsidies for cost-burdened households."
08_10_2016,homeless,"Thank you, [ORGANIZATION]. I just wanted to show you, there's FAC0. A lot of people don't know what it is, but you can see there's an awful lot of vacant land around there that could be used for the homeless."
08_10_2016,homelessness,I'm the conservation director for [ORGANIZATION]. And ORG1 supports aggressive prioritization of addressing homelessness and houselessness in this city. We supported that for [ORGANIZATION].
08_10_2016,homeless; houseless,"The environmental implications, the economic implications are tremendous on this, and you just simply haven't looked at that. Furthermore, the site is also contaminated, and the idea of putting homeless and houseless people on a contaminated site is completely inappropriate. These sites take a long time to clean up and to make safe, and the idea that you can do this quickly is not realistic."
08_10_2016,homeless; affordable housing,"Mayor, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], ORG1 Vice Chair. But [ORGANIZATION] I'm here as I'm not speaking for the commission, just as a citizen. And I want to speak to the long-term...  of terminal one um one long term if it is going to become long-term affordable housing or housing for the homeless that's a conditional use relative to the comp plan that is a type three you would need to show available lands relative to the jobs first it transfers from  industrial to housing."
08_10_2016,homeless,"the second part of that is goal 9 as a [ORGANIZATION] we struggled with meeting goal 9 and i know you did too through the comp plan and you raised the the cargo from low to medium in looking at that jobs category  Through the type three, you would need to prove that, again, in looking at how you're going to meet those jobs with an increased deficit. And so while I'm very supportive of doing something for the homeless, and I think that's a top priority, I encourage you to think about the long term."
08_10_2016,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] and Commissioners, I'm [PERSON], a leader with [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]. We want to state strongly on the record that we support this only as a  We also want to express some of our concerns and ask for measures to ensure that this will, in fact, be temporary, transitional, and transparent. We're concerned that homeless people facing impending sweeps have other places in which they may immediately situate themselves."
08_10_2016,homeless; homelessness; affordable housing,"We're concerned that pressure to find good solutions will diminish if the homeless are simply moved out of sight. We're concerned that public money spent on literally warehousing homeless people will not only maintain the status quo for them and for our city, but that money will be diverted from providing true transitional and permanent affordable housing that is healthy, safe, and secure. We're concerned that those most knowledgeable about the problems and solutions of homelessness are opposed to the proposed long-term project."
08_10_2016,homelessness,We also appreciate the distress of neighborhoods. And we can appreciate the pressures that you must fill to address the competing needs in our community. But we must appreciate most the needs of those people actually experiencing homelessness.
08_10_2016,homeless; homelessness,"From their longtime advocates, we understand that the warehousing of homeless people tends only to lock them into warehousing and into continued homelessness. We have not had nearly enough time to meaningfully understand or respond to the full proposed project envisioned by [ORGANIZATION] until the community has had a reasonable time to consider its long-term implications. We ask for council's commitment to ensure that what passes [ORGANIZATION], if it does, is truly temporary."
08_10_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"And if I could just take [TIME] to make two specific requests. Okay. We ask and expect that you'll develop further plans for permanent, sustainable, restorative solutions to our homelessness and affordable housing crises, and that those plans be responsive to public testimony, be accountable, and be transparent in all phases."
08_10_2016,housing crisis,"And we ask that the proposal, if it passes, that the city make a report on T1 to the public and hold a public hearing [DATE].  [ORGANIZATION] prior to any renewal of this temporary use of T1. And we look forward to working with you on solutions to the housing crisis that threatens the neighbors and the city that we love. Thank you."
08_10_2016,unhoused,"I do a lot of work with the unhoused communities. And...  I've been to a lot of city council meetings where we deal with this, and this has to be the most preposterous idea that I've ever heard come out of this council or the previous one. So we have this giant track record of making bad decisions and coming up with projects that don't work, and then we reverse them, and we keep changing our course, and then we do this and we do that."
08_10_2016,unhoused,"We have 96 neighborhood associations, and for easy math, let's say that we have 300 unhoused people. Each neighborhood association identifies one plot of land where we can set up an intentional micro-community, just like [ORGANIZATION]. Self-policed, mostly self-funded."
08_10_2016,homelessness,That's inhumane. That's criminalizing homelessness because... There is a prison.
08_10_2016,homeless,"As public and private sector leaders, we have a responsibility to address these shortages by providing both. There's no need, in our view, to pit a [INSTITUTION] and industrial land against one another. We don't know why it's become quite this level of dispute."
08_10_2016,homeless,"But there is competition within the community in private businesses for washers and dryers. I mean, other people within community apartments or in houses also want to use that spot and they don't like. They're not really comfortable with people less homeless than them.  or excuse me, more homeless than them as they perceive using the washers and dryers."
08_10_2016,homeless,"so that they don't, new shelters don't have the same problem, or create more to the problem with the people on the buses, with dirty laundry. And then someone mentioned porta-potties. I remember in the past, I'm not against housing homeless at all."
08_10_2016,homeless,"I am in homeless camp at least once a week, and I live downtown [ORGANIZATION], and I walk outside my building, and at least once a week I walk out of my building to see a man urinating on the wall right near me. the door of my building. And in the homeless camps down on the corridor, I know personally the rats, and I'm talking about the little critters with the long tail."
08_10_2016,homeless,"That figure is going to run anywhere from, it sounds like, $10,000 to $30,000 a month, however the council decides. We don't expect additional costs over and above that. There will be staff time that is currently [ORGANIZATION] and myself that will likely be working with [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] to further refine the...  program, the service levels to be provided by the operators."
08_10_2016,homelessness,"I was struck by two statements from the public, one sort of at the beginning and one towards the end. PERSON0, or [PERSON], near the beginning said, This problem of homelessness needs a big vision. PERSON2, who I think was our last testifier, said, Humanize the issue."
08_10_2016,homelessness,"We need to humanize the issue. And I absolutely agree. I mean, the problem of homelessness in our community is enormous."
08_10_2016,homelessness,"I'm proud of that and we're going to stay clean on that issue and not spend ratepayer money on housing and homelessness as important as this priority is. So we don't need to pass this amendment in order to hew to that principle, but we do need to do some careful accounting and square up as is needed later on. But I don't see that we need to adopt these amendments in order to do that."
08_10_2016,homeless,"I think it's important to give Mr. [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] a chance to make this happen, a chance to see an expansion of our capacity to help homeless people with private money, and the with private money thing is important. And I also do think there is some urgency because it would be nice if we actually had a facility up and running before the cold weather hits. I've heard a lot of people say, well, there must be a bunch of other sites."
08_10_2016,homeless,"And the [ORGANIZATION], I think, recently published a list of 120 sites that the mayor has looked at over there and [ORGANIZATION] looked at in [ORGANIZATION]. I actually called [ORGANIZATION] over [LOCATION] and I figured he's no longer with the city, he can speak freely, and asked him, are there better sites than FAC0 for homeless shelters that we know were better but we dismissed them for political reasons?"
08_10_2016,homeless,"So if somebody comes to us in [ORGANIZATION] and says,  we have a plan for operating [ORGANIZATION] we've raised the money to do it we've got at least as good a plan for operating [ORGANIZATION] as [ORGANIZATION] has for operating FAC0 and the county has bought into it and since we're really opposed to FAC0 we'll only do [ORGANIZATION] FAC0 doesn't happen i'm would be opening to listening to that argument  I have suggested looking into FAC1, which is an underutilized city asset, as a [INSTITUTION]. It's fairly centrally located, has transit, bathrooms, showers, et cetera. It's my understanding that the city has had discussions with the trailblazers that sort of have the operating rights to that facility about that, and the blazers were willing to listen, but given their contractual obligations to other users, that's not something that could happen soon."
08_10_2016,homeless,"As I said before, I think that the issue of the lease amount is something that needs further discussion. Again, I really, really appreciate everybody's testimony, and I'm not voting yes because I think the arguments against using FAC0 are bad arguments. I'm voting yes because I think that we are not in the position in this state of homeless emergency to look a gift horse in the mouth."
08_10_2016,houseless,"We got a zoning confirmation letter. We know that the property is suitable for the proposed use. And then since we got that decided, we've been working with the community, the houseless community, to see what they want on the property."
08_10_2016,houseless,"Thank you.  to get something like this cited, even if we wanted to just go right ahead and not consult with people in the houseless community. But I think we should. Nothing about us without us."
08_10_2016,homeless; homelessness,"His title is, [PERSON] Isn't a Media Event, It's Real Life. It sucks to be homeless. Some people think it's easy in [ORGANIZATION]."
08_10_2016,homeless,"They are wrong. Nobody is choosing to be homeless because they don't want to go to a shelter. Seriously, would you?"
08_10_2016,homeless,"Good luck. [PERSON] says,  2,000 people didn't just decide to be homeless just to create a media spectacle or piss off the larger community. People are sleeping on our streets are human beings."
08_10_2016,homelessness,"But [ORGANIZATION] I've been inspired by people who get up committed to ending the national disgrace of homelessness and who believe that everyone has a right to a safe and decent [STREET] to call home. And it is the reason I ran for office, and it is the reason I have been proud to partner with my colleagues in [LOCATION] around this emergency to do things that prior councils have not done. But my values tell me a couple of things about how we do this work."
08_10_2016,homelessness,"I don't question my colleagues' motives or their values or their commitment to the fight against homelessness. But [ORGANIZATION], I question their judgment. No."
08_10_2016,homelessness,"It was a serious commitment to a real crisis in both housing affordability for lots of people in our community, and we've heard about that again [ORGANIZATION], and we'll hear about it any time the subject comes up because it is a crisis [ORGANIZATION].  and about homelessness, which our city has been struggling with for a long time, and now [ORGANIZATION] cities in particular are struggling with at a whole new level because of all the reasons that have been mentioned. So this is a real thing. We've committed to it, and the crisis is far from over."
08_10_2016,homelessness,"If there's anything I've learned in working on homelessness, it's that no good deed goes unpunished, but we should keep doing the good deeds and keep trying things. So I want to say let's keep trying to work together as a community here, even if this is a divided vote and even if this is a divided [ORGANIZATION]. Let's do the right thing."
08_10_2016,homeless,"So I wanted to...  Thank you for the whatever behind-the-scenes work had to be done with [ORGANIZATION] and Governor [PERSON]'s office to get these homeowners, who are not the most affluent and politically influential people in [ORGANIZATION], some release and assistance. The gentleman who just testified, of course, alluded to some people almost wish there might be flooding along [ORGANIZATION]. I hope that as you also look at other ways government can work that people,  we can target government action towards the problems like this flood insurance issue and dealing with people using the criminal system the [STREET] it's supposed to be used to deal with people who have a problem where they become criminals who deal with methamphetamine or bicycles, not uniformly acting against some homeless people who are close to having stable micro-community housing in [PERSON]."
08_10_2016,affordable housing,"The key themes that we really heard is that there is support for [ORGANIZATION]. and we heard loud and clear that there's support for affordable housing, but there was support for mixed income that includes affordable housing. And finally, providing flexibility in resources was an important comment that we received as well."
08_10_2016,affordable housing,"Yes. Good question, Commissioner [PERSON]. I can tell you right now the project that's being proposed at the FAC0 and FAC1 site, the [ORGANIZATION] and ORG1 team, we've heard loud and clear from community members that they would like to see a mix of affordable housing and obviously ORG2 would play a role in supporting that up to the 60 percent MFI level."
08_10_2016,affordable housing,"And with this money that's designated to be spent in the FAC0 area, I'm hoping that some of that money that isn't the affordable housing money can be spent to subsidize that so we can get that mix of housing that we desperately need in that area. We need affordable housing, but we also need the other housing as well in order to have a mix. Okay."
08_10_2016,affordable housing,"Great.  excited to have them thank you all right others who would like to speak on this point come on up please welcome hi my name is [ORGANIZATION] and I build apartments in the [ORGANIZATION] area I've been in front of you before and testified the last time was FAC0 on FAC1, and I praised that program because it worked, and it opened up that area for further development. And since then, and one of the things I said is I wanted to develop –  market rate and affordable housing in that area just south of FAC2, [PERSON]."
08_10_2016,affordable housing,"It more than triples my cost. And I think this is a good time to look at an LID for the whole area because... FAC0 will thrive, but it needs affordable housing and other types of housing so that the jobs that get created in that area, people can live close by."
09_02_2015,homeless,"So with those ground rules in [STREET], let's please take Item 903. 903, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding homeless issues. PERSON1 here?"
09_02_2015,homeless,"Item 903, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding homeless issues. Although we will be moving soon. I'm sorry to interrupt you."
09_02_2015,homeless,"Either one is fine, but just get close to it, please. OK. Although we will be moving soon, there will be still homeless people looking for a safe [STREET], warm [STREET] to lay down and rest or a hot meal."
09_02_2015,homeless,"We all need to solve this homeless problem in [ORGANIZATION] instead of pushing all of us into the next state. So there we go.  904 request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel regarding homeless issues reader you here Okay, what will give her another opportunity?"
09_02_2015,homeless,905 please request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel regarding homeless issues. Good morning. Come on up.
09_02_2015,homeless,"DATE0, the homeless percentage has went up 30%. I think in [LOCATION], it's going to be 60% if we don't do something now. I'm seriously really, I would think about putting more right to dreams to the city."
09_02_2015,homelessness,"And you're a smart man, and I know you can do it. This needs to be really addressed quickly. Before we knew it, before we know it, it's going to be [ORGANIZATION] down the line, and it's going to be 75% homelessness."
09_02_2015,homeless,Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding homeless issues. Good morning. Come on up.
09_02_2015,homeless,"Good morning, council. As you know, my name is [ORGANIZATION]. And my perspective and perception of the homeless situation goes like this."
09_02_2015,homeless,"I don't want to just talk about the fact that we have a growing homeless population, not just here but nationwide. I'm going to talk about what I see is the problem with the homeless and where this homeless population is growing, coming from. And I wrote down this real quickly, and I'm a little nervous, but I'm going to get it out as smoothly as possible in [TIME]."
09_02_2015,homeless,"Therefore, adding to the homeless population, which...  doesn't help the fact that FAC0 and places like them are trying to take the homeless people off the [STREET] and try to reinduce them into having housing and being what we call citizens, honorable citizens, where they aren't being harassed by people, places, and things. With that being said, that's what I came here to speak on. Great."
09_02_2015,homeless,"Just pull that microphone down so it's relatively close to you there. Thank you. I was last here to talk about asking the USS Zumwalt to come and head up the Rose Festival.  and talk about Zero Homeless Vets Act, but since Mayor [PERSON] mentioned me by name and my cat not by name, in [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION], I thought you'd be interested in how that, oh, as a successfully housed former homeless vet, I thought you'd be interested in how that success keeps going."
09_02_2015,homeless,"So in that spirit, I've set up and funded [ORGANIZATION], a non-religious nonprofit dedicated to helping house primarily homeless ORG1 vets and their family, and keep them housed. The ORG2 has given us 501c3 status. You can find us at [URL]."
09_07_2017,affordable housing,"$64 million for the gas tax, $250 million for the affordable housing bond. This is seven times the gas tax, twice the affordable housing bond for a project that, again, has no demonstrable benefits that they are ostensibly claiming to be provided. Okay."
09_07_2017,affordable housing,Finding affordable housing close to where people work is more and more of a challenge. Freeway expansion is hugely expensive and proven not to reduce congestion. Mobility is a large component of our livability.
09_07_2017,affordable housing,"Most important is that the maximum building heights in [ORGANIZATION] need to be lowered to 100 feet. The result will be to discourage demolition, encourage rehabilitation and reuse, both of which will help preserve a large number of existing affordable housing units in the district, a top priority [ORGANIZATION]. See examples of affordable housing on pages 2, [DATE], and 5 in my detailed recommendations."
09_07_2017,affordable housing,"By market-priced residences depriving [ORGANIZATION] of an already inadequate supply of low-income housing, would my walks become more perilous through [ORGANIZATION]-like traffic, sunless wind tunnels, and cold concrete and glass storefronts? I don't assume that affordable housing would survive this change. I urge the council to protect affordable housing and the unique livability of [LOCATION] and set 100-foot limits on building height."
09_07_2017,houseless,"But as an innovative vision for [ORGANIZATION]'s future, it can be built with a strong set of core values that define the [ORGANIZATION] we all want to see. So I'm here [ORGANIZATION] to ask that [ORGANIZATION] be built truly for everyone, that it be physically and culturally accessible, that it be developed through extensive community input, especially by those whose voices have historically been muted, that it feels welcoming and safe even for the persecuted, that it feels as if it belonged as much to the resident of the central city as to the resident of the outer neighborhoods, and that everyone, the houseless and the housed, feels a collective ownership of this unifying space in the central city. Thank you."
09_07_2017,homelessness,"I previously testified, he says, about cautionary research into the impacts of tall buildings and the dangers of what I called voodoo urbanism. That is over-concentrating attention on the expensive cause of cities and neglecting the capacities of their many other neighborhoods to grow in a more benign [STREET]. As we see in so many other cities on [ORGANIZATION] and elsewhere, the result too often is even more runaway loss of affordability, livability and heritage, displacement, over-gentrification, homelessness and other serious urban ills."
09_07_2017,homeless,"Most sustainable and affordable is the structure that exists, not the tower that replaces an historic building after it has been demolished. According to [ORGANIZATION] of [ORGANIZATION], a building higher than five stories requires rent some two and a half times the rents from garden apartment developments. A major changeover to residential towers will put more [ORGANIZATION] citizens at a loss for homes and add to our already burgeoning homeless population."
09_07_2017,affordable housing,"In order to curb the raising of historic buildings and affordable housing units and to preserve the character of our neighborhood, please consider limiting [ORGANIZATION] building heights to 100 feet. I also wanted to say that I support the amendments announced by Mayor [PERSON] to preserve site corridors from [LOCATION] and LOC2, as well as Commissioner [PERSON]'s call for changes in height restrictions at the river level. Thank you."
09_07_2017,affordable housing,"The prices in the new construction, the tall glass towers, tended to be much higher, often well over $2,[ADDRESS], there will be tremendous market pressure to demolish these vintage buildings, and we will lose some of the best affordable housing stock in downtown [ORGANIZATION]. This proposal also supports the goal of the draft of preserving housing diversity and no net loss."
09_07_2017,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], you folks have made very impressive efforts recently to address the affordability crisis and I applaud you for that. And this [STREET] we can continue that. The character and historic flavor of the neighborhood will be preserved and affordable housing can be provided."
09_07_2017,affordable housing,"On image number five, you'll see nine historic buildings in [ORGANIZATION] that we're trying to protect. They're either listed on [ORGANIZATION] or on [ORGANIZATION]. Please provide affordable housing and some of the cheapest market rate rents per square foot in our neighborhood."
09_07_2017,affordable housing,"Yes. And we know that –  building affordable housing that's owned by the city, well, they're not going to demolish that building. Well, in this case, we partnered with [ORGANIZATION], I guess."
09_07_2017,affordable housing,"First of all...  What within the – and I'll give – you don't have to write this down. What within FAC0 helps owners acquire the additional FAR needed to ensure the affordable housing and seismic improvements?  are achieved beyond the base zoning requirements? Number two, given the multimodal mixed-use area designation within FAC0 plan, doesn't that address past barriers with [ORGANIZATION] due to additional trip generation?"
09_07_2017,affordable housing,"My sense is that requiring a transfer seems unnecessary and just adds to the uncertainty and the length of time it takes to get projects going. And lastly, what is the problem, if any, of simply allowing a project to build to its allowed height once it meets our affordable housing and seismic upgrade standards for the first three to one FAR? So I'll give you this later."
09_07_2017,affordable housing,"one of the most significant redevelopment sites in [ORGANIZATION]'s central city, consistent with [LOCATION] and the DATE0 Broadway Corridor Framework Plan. This project will bring approximately 700 units of affordable housing, a high-density mix of employment, new city attractions, including expansion of the park blocks,  and signature connections between [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] and between LOC2 and FAC0. I'll now turn it over to [ORGANIZATION] and PERSON1."
07_08_2020,affordable housing,"I consider them to be the experts on these issues and the backstop for what can be built in our historic districts. However, I have a different charge than members of the [ORGANIZATION]. As a city council, we have to weigh issues such as affordable housing and displacement, economic development, and the viability of the business district along with historic preservation considerations."
07_08_2020,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] needs investment and development, both commercial and residential. Little of either has happened despite the considerably higher height allowances in the previous comprehensive plan. We heard from some community members that affordable housing is not needed or wanted in the historic district."
07_08_2020,affordable housing,Affordable housing is needed everywhere in our city. More market and luxury rate housing is decidedly not. We have a shortfall of tens of thousands of affordable units and a surplus of market and luxury rate units in the thousands.
07_08_2020,affordable housing,"To be clear, when we were talking about affordable housing and private development, we were talking about...  units at 60 to 80% of median family income in a city where market rate housing is unaffordable to anyone earning less than 120% of median family income. This is workforce and student housing. This is housing that would be affordable to many of the essential workers who are currently risking their health to serve our community while struggling to afford market rate rents."
07_08_2020,affordable housing,"I share a core value with my colleagues on the [ORGANIZATION] that we are in need of affordable housing options that serve all Portlanders.  particularly those who are low income and at risk of displacement. And I also understand from ORG1 that they also want market rate housing since there's so much low income housing in the district already. As we heard in the testimony in [ORGANIZATION], out-of-proportion development threatens the historic and cultural integrity of the new [ORGANIZATION] district."
07_08_2020,affordable housing,"What this plan does differently is that it sets the stage for a vibrant, equitable, and healthy city core. The plan helps us realize our goals for more affordable housing, yes, but also increased resilience in the face of climate change and economic recession, and better jobs and more of them thinking more broadly.  oddly about who can gain access to those jobs. In other words, we've really broadened the scope of planning in the city through this central city plan."
07_08_2020,affordable housing,"It is my true pleasure to ask for your support to support [ORGANIZATION] on [ORGANIZATION]. PERSON1 currently serves as the Executive Director for [ORGANIZATION], or ORG2, a culturally specific affordable housing developer and service provider serving the Black community, primarily in [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]east [ORGANIZATION]. Ms. [PERSON]'s experience in economic development, local government, and affordable housing blended with her commitment to advancing equitable outcomes for the [ORGANIZATION] community makes her an excellent candidate for the commission, and I am very grateful that she is willing to commit her time and expertise to [LOCATION] and the city through [ORGANIZATION]."
07_08_2020,affordable housing,"and oh my gosh, with your background, it sounds fascinating that you are in affordable housing. How did that happen? When I worked in city government for the city of [ORGANIZATION], we were typically that agency as the redevelopment agency to provide the financing to developers to build affordable housing."
07_08_2020,affordable housing,"And I believe the state of [ORGANIZATION] made a very big mistake when they ended redevelopment throughout the state of [ORGANIZATION] to shore up a $30 billion shortfall that [ORGANIZATION] had back in [ORGANIZATION]. When they did that, it eliminated a lot of the provisions that were available  particularly the tax increment, the housing set aside piece that allowed for redevelopment agencies to pair with developers to get affordable housing built. So that was my experience working for the city of [PERSON] and in housing and it's always been a big interest of mine, particularly providing clean, decent living standards for black people and people of color."
07_08_2020,affordable housing,"This is obviously an important commission. It's our primary forum for the discussion of affordable housing policy, strategy, resources. So the experience that you bring from [ORGANIZATION] as well as your prior experience is critically important."
07_08_2020,affordable housing,"So I vote aye. You PERSON0? Well, if this is the quality we can expect from new construction, it doesn't bode well for the theory that [ORGANIZATION]'s market rate housing will be [ORGANIZATION]'s affordable housing."
07_08_2020,affordable housing,"Authorized 17 subrecipient contracts totaling $5,062,200 for services in support of providing affordable housing to include emergency home repair, home ownership counseling and education, and renter services, including relocation assistance and education and advocacy. Colleagues, [ORGANIZATION] subrecipient contracts leverage city funding sources to help some of [ORGANIZATION]'s most effective nonprofit organizations provide the housing services our community needs the most. The services are provided to [ORGANIZATION]'s low to moderate income residents."
07_08_2020,affordable housing,"Establish code sections to administer the FAR transfer from existing affordable housing and three-bedroom unit FAR density bonus option programs that were approved through [ORGANIZATION]. Colleagues, the council approved [ORGANIZATION] project back in [ORGANIZATION]. The project included bonus programs created to increase the development of housing affordable to low and moderate income home buyers and renters across the city."
07_08_2020,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] is here [ORGANIZATION] with code allowing the ORG1 to effectively administer both the affordable housing bonus transfer program as well as the three-bedroom bonus program that were both approved back in [LOCATION]. And so with that, I believe we have [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] here. I see [ORGANIZATION], are you with us as well [ORGANIZATION]?"
07_08_2020,affordable housing,"So code section 30.01.150 is an addition to the affordable housing code to establish the floor area ratio transfer from existing affordable housing program. For properties with existing housing affordable to households  earning up to 60% of median family income to transfer floor area ratio to another site. That's based on zoning code subsection 33.120210D1A, which went into effect DATE0."
07_08_2020,affordable housing,"And additionally, code section 30.01.160 is the  addition to the affordable housing code to establish the three bedroom unit FAR density bonus option program to encourage more family sized units by providing a 25% FAR bonus for projects with three bedroom units affordable to households earning up to a hundred percent in median family income based on zoning code subsection 33 120 211 3c and  And this went into effect [ORGANIZATION]. So codification of these programs in Title 30 allows [ORGANIZATION] to move forward with rulemaking, ensuring effective administration of the programs, which are already available under the current zoning code. And with that, I'm happy to answer any questions."
07_08_2020,affordable housing,"Starting in [ORGANIZATION], any building adding 20 or more new units is required to contribute to the city's affordable housing inventory through [ORGANIZATION]. Developers must choose from several options in order to fulfill inclusionary housing requirements, providing affordable units in an otherwise market rate building, sending units to another building, or paying into ORG1. And so the multiple unit limited tax exemption or multi program is one of the financial incentives provided to inclusionary housing buildings making units affordable rather than paying a fee in lieu."
07_08_2020,affordable housing,"I actually was concerned about this because I was concerned that the affordable, well, the 60% MFI units  would be something that would be down the [STREET]. So I'm very supportive of those units being built first, because we've had that experience in [ORGANIZATION] where developers run out of money halfway through a project and oops, what didn't get built was the affordable housing unit. So I think this is a good model for us to be moving forward."
07_08_2020,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] provides economic development services, while [ORGANIZATION] provides access to affordable housing. These agencies provide funding oversight to each other to ensure the most effective programs possible. And I believe we have, yes, there she is."
07_08_2020,affordable housing,"Okay, the next proposal is the inclusionary housing extension. So this one's a little different. So the inclusionary housing standards, they set the rate at which affordable housing units must be provided for residential projects with 20 or more units."
07_08_2020,affordable housing,"And so these standards are the rate at which affordable housing must be provided or lower for areas that are outside of the central city and for gateway units. And so to date, since the inclusion of housing was originally passed, these rates have been extended by [ORGANIZATION]. They were set to expire at [LOCATION], and they were expired and set to until DATE2."
07_08_2020,affordable housing,"So and just as you can see here under the current code, the standards in [ORGANIZATION] or [LOCATION], 10% of units for.  for projects that are subject to inclusionary housing, 10% of all units has to meet the 65 or 60% median family income, or 20% of the units have to be at 80% median family income. And outside the central city or gateway,  It's 8% and 15%. And so this project poses to delay that the [ORGANIZATION] increase of the affordable housing rates outside the central city gateway for [LOCATION]."
07_08_2020,affordable housing,"The inclusionary housing program is a key zoning tool for increasing permanent affordable housing. I'm committed to a [ORGANIZATION] study focused on ways to improve the inclusionary housing program and believe [ORGANIZATION] extension provides a reasonable time frame to align with this effort. We can always, of course, extend it if necessary."
07_08_2020,affordable housing,"And I truly appreciate the initial reprogramming of the funds to address the pandemic. You know, that was a tough time and everyone responded quickly and understandably. Now we're at a point where it's important that that [ORGANIZATION] restores that funding and develops a robust scope through the FAC0 study to really look at all the elements of the program So that the inclusionary housing program can really produce the level of affordable housing It was envisioned to create in [ORGANIZATION] since [ORGANIZATION] implemented the inclusionary housing program"
07_08_2020,affordable housing,"We are a developer of affordable housing, including the recently completed [ORGANIZATION]. Thank you, Mayor, for participating in our virtual dedication ceremony [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] has about 1,200 units of affordable housing in the [ORGANIZATION] area."
07_08_2020,affordable housing,"We have about six projects in our pipeline. Company-wide, we have 12 projects under construction in three states and 76 affordable housing projects.  underway. We've been in business [ORGANIZATION] and we're committed deeply to social equity and  and furthering the goals of equity and inclusion through housing."
07_08_2020,affordable housing,"And I asked both the [ORGANIZATION] staff, as well as the city attorney staff to look into this and see if there was any [STREET] for this to be viable within this particular ordinance. Because the project that you represent, I think, is a very worthwhile one, and it represents a significant commitment to affordable housing. So it's something that philosophically I am very much supportive of and want to support."
06_25_2015,homeless,"679 authorize a grant to central city concern in an amount not to exceed 1 million 716 410 for the provision of treatment readiness services transitional housing and follow-up retention support services to chemically dependent homeless adult chronic arrestees so i know there were questions about this chance to get informed folks here if you have further questions  We're all set, Mayor. All set. So thank you for being here as resources."
06_25_2015,homelessness,"You're a great partner, and we depend on great partners for these programs to work. I think what we need to be doing in a number of areas, homelessness, mental health, youth at risk,  is find partnerships that work and do more, take them to scale. So I'm very interested not only in maintaining the service coordination team, but expanding it because it works."
06_25_2015,homelessness,"So I want to hear from the [ORGANIZATION] about that, from the management of the team, from our partners. you know the definition of insanity is to keep doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different result so if we're doing things that are different and working well again in any of these intergovernmental issues that are also dealing with long-term intractable problems like drug addiction and homelessness and youth at risk to name three um  Let's again seize on things that are working and do more of them. So I'm very interested not just in hearing back from you about how the program is working and how our contractors are performing, but what we could do more of with more resources."
06_25_2015,affordable housing,"And I'm going to be interested in seeing what more we can do, not just with the funds that you and I have earmarked in the interstate urban rural area, but elsewhere for trying to give people more home ownership opportunities. We've concentrated a lot in affordable housing, on affordable rental housing, but I think the ability of people to buy homes in the city is another affordability issue that we want to focus on more. So thanks for attending to that as well."
06_25_2015,affordable housing,"Aye. Aye. Okay, 691. Authorized consortium agreement with [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] to participate in [ORGANIZATION] to receive affordable housing funds."
06_25_2015,affordable housing,PERSON0? Aye. PERSON1? Aye. 692. Amend the tax increment financing set aside for affordable housing policy to extend the deadline for [ORGANIZATION] to conduct a thorough review of the policy from [ORGANIZATION] to [LOCATION].
06_25_2015,homelessness; affordable housing,"Then it comes back for second reading [ORGANIZATION], 693. Authorize 20 subrecipient contracts totaling $16,777,246 for services in support of ending homelessness and providing affordable housing. Commissioner [PERSON]."
06_25_2015,homeless; homelessness,"Thank you, Ms. [PERSON]. This will provide over $16 million of a broad continuum of assistance and services for low-income homeowners, renters, homeless individuals, and families. and those at risk at homelessness."
06_25_2015,homelessness,"I know we're not going to vote on this until [ORGANIZATION], but... The Exhibit A that's attached is an honor roll of mission-driven nonprofits that are core partners of the city in advancing our goals towards reducing and ultimately ending homelessness. And we are talking about a mix of funds, including general fund, federal funds, and then funds that are competitive funds."
06_25_2015,homelessness,"And if anyone wants to sort of see the roadmap of how this community on an [ORGANIZATION] basis attempts to tackle this enormous challenge of homelessness, Exhibit A is about as good a document as I've seen that lays out all of our great partners who are working on the front lines of making a difference. Questions? Thanks, Mayor."
06_25_2015,homeless,"And one of the persons that got a copy of that was [ORGANIZATION], who we named the men's shelter in FAC0 after. So I'm going to tell you all right now,  I do know about how heat rises and cold sinks because it is a function of gravity. I do know how people become perpetually chronically homeless in this city."
06_25_2015,homeless; homelessness; affordable housing,"I am one of them. I am housed with a [ORGANIZATION] grant as a person with a disability that meets the definition of chronically homeless. I'm telling you, I became chronically homeless and endured chronic homelessness in this city because the nonprofit affordable housing landlord, no doubt, has FAC0 vacant right now."
06_25_2015,affordable housing,He's still partnering with them. You're still partnering with them. Why are we keeping affordable housing vacant and awarding these types of things?
08_21_2019,homeless,"Hi, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]. I just want to echo [PERSON] and the gentlelady over here for speaking out about drug testing and people carrying weapons or driving a car, which begs the question, what about running a city as commissioners or a county as commissioners and drug testing? Thank you."
08_07_2019,homeless,Thank you. It's whether you're for or against this item once again. I would like to see – Homeless artists engage in this.
08_07_2019,homeless,So that that'll be a big part of it. We're also looking at the what to be what's to be done with the homeless boat situation on the river. That's we want to be involved with that and something needs to be done.
08_07_2019,homeless,"And then one of the things that's pretty big right now, like [ORGANIZATION] had said, was the, and it's not just the derelict boats, it's the homeless living on the side of the river, just, you know, sinking boats, creating some issues that we're trying to kind of get in, learn more about, figure out the best [STREET], best people to contact. Yeah, and it is a complicated issue. It is."
08_07_2019,affordable housing,"Working with [ORGANIZATION], we now include language in affordable housing development solicitations that preferences developers who include creative space in their buildings. And we work closely with the team at [ORGANIZATION] on their affordable commercial space initiative to ensure that the two ideas are complementary. We've had a productive partnership with [ORGANIZATION], especially around the recommendation about short-term leases in buildings that are in queue for development."
08_07_2019,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], an advisor on our arts affordability plan, is deeply dedicated to the arts. We hope that conversations with her and the FAC0 development team will eventually lead to a strong arts component in the built-out FAC0 Yards. Across town, a developer in [ORGANIZATION] faced a challenge programming the commercial space in an affordable housing mixed-use development."
06_14_2017,homeless,Why are you sending a letter to him? He should be sending a letter to you saying what happened. You also are doing some good stuff with the homeless.
06_14_2017,homeless,"[DATE] you actually do something that's significant about the homeless in this city, I will come back and buy you a mocha. Perfect. Deal accepted."
06_14_2017,affordable housing,"Colleagues, item 692 is being, if you could call item 692. Aye. Amend relocation assistance regulations in affordable housing preservation and [ORGANIZATION] renter protections."
06_14_2017,affordable housing,"This is just a piece of a long-planned neighborhood greenway route that would connect all the [STREET] from FAC0 to FAC1, with crossings at major streets, sort of traffic calming, to provide a really nice, calm alternative for people walking and biking. And it's connecting an area of major growth to our biggest job center. There's high concentrations of affordable housing in these areas."
06_14_2017,affordable housing,"wow, what if we could free up that space for more housing? The more housing we have, the lower housing prices. We get more affordable housing."
08_19_2015,homeless,"I'm calling upon you to subcontract with the county to open FAC0 for our homeless, drug rehab and mental health needs. Moving our most vulnerable and their services outside the dangerous downtown area. There are 4,[ADDRESS] now and they are desperate."
08_19_2015,homelessness,"But no more. There are big problems. We want to work with you to resolve homelessness, drug addiction, sex trafficking, drug trafficking, crime, and mental health issues."
08_19_2015,homeless; affordable housing,"And then there are, well, actually there are three. There are people with disabilities  who are homeless, who don't have drug problems, who don't have mental problems. And certainly Commissioner [PERSON] and the mayor are working together to see how we can provide more subsidized housing, how can we create more affordable housing in the city."
08_19_2015,homeless,"It appears to me, though, that [ORGANIZATION]'s revenue does not meet its needs, such as fixing our embarrassing roads, funding our schools, housing our homeless, and addressing climate change. Thank you. For example, I was disappointed to learn that the main source of funds for the [ORGANIZATION] initiative is not a reliable local revenue source, but federal Section 8 funds."
08_19_2015,homeless,Request of Pastor PERSON0 to address council regarding a pilot program to address the garbage left in camps of the homeless. Good morning. Welcome.
08_19_2015,homeless,"Good morning. I'm Pastor PERSON0. Our church, a [STREET] of worship, is a ministry to the homeless and addicts in southeast [ORGANIZATION]."
08_19_2015,homeless,"One is a young lady who spent over [ORGANIZATION] on the [STREET] with a DATE1 meth addiction. She's been clean for DATE2 now, living in her own apartment with her [ORGANIZATION] son and just graduated from [ORGANIZATION] with a [PERSON] degree. I've worked with the homeless for [PERSON], and though that does not make me an expert, it has given me a much better understanding about the homeless and their frame of mind."
08_19_2015,homeless,"We've been discussing these issues with [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, and other homeless organizations. What we are currently doing, once a week we're open for lunch, clothing, and hygiene items, providing garbage bags to return trash back to our location, and working to set up a needle exchange program so they won't be left in parks for the children to find. What we would like to add is to have a dumpster on site,  and in various locations."
08_19_2015,homeless,Being a homeless ministry brings in little income to our offering box. We're all volunteers with no paid positions. Relying on donations from people in our community is our only means of financial support.
08_19_2015,homeless,Now my reason for coming here [ORGANIZATION] is to ask for assistance from the city. Arranging another meeting with city officials to work on the specific issues is my main goal. The problems associated with homeless may never get resolved 100%.
08_19_2015,homeless,The task this city faces is bigger than any one organization can handle. Many of the homeless in our church are ready to help. What our ministry is doing [ORGANIZATION] may not even be noticeable.
08_19_2015,homeless,"Are you involved with any of the other religious communities, the communities of faith within the city? There's a couple other homeless organizations. Anawim.  organizations out in [ORGANIZATION] we've talked with [ORGANIZATION] from the [PERSON] parks there's a collect miss service center that we also are part of and  talking with them about some of the issues and working on the garbage issues and things."
08_19_2015,homelessness,"Okay, 833, please. Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding our professional apartment management companies, the solution for decreasing chronic homelessness. Good morning."
08_19_2015,homeless,"I represent [ORGANIZATION]  One of the things I'd like to see city council possibly do is create a committee comprised of professional apartment management company experts. I'd like to have some strategies created by the professionals in the housing industry on allowing people into properties, on basically how to take care of the most vulnerable people in this city, the chronic homeless, and help them into housing. Again, I'd like to understand from the property management companies, do you need more incentives to possibly motivate you to do that?"
08_19_2015,affordable housing,"Issue number two, Commissioner [PERSON], I think it's time in your legacy – this will be your legacy, in my opinion –  to create a general obligation bond that is going to be used for affordable housing throughout this city. I am asking, in my opinion, I think we should look at anywhere from $50 million to $100 million. As you know, and the mayor knows this, Mayor [PERSON] is somewhere around a $300 million bond right now pertaining to housing."
08_19_2015,homeless,"I proposed this many, many times. Again, we're not asking to have this set up as an institution. We're asking to have this set up as [ORGANIZATION] for the homeless, similar to a shelter."
08_19_2015,homeless,"They can house approximately 300 to 500 people, and they're currently in the building. We need to have [ORGANIZATION], who I commend you on running your ads to benefit the homeless. I want you to look at [ORGANIZATION], which will be FAC0."
08_19_2015,homeless,"Get involved and get community support from the business owners. And let's get this opened up and let's get the homeless in there. Again, I'm asking [ORGANIZATION] to step in, to focus on [ORGANIZATION], because this will be one of the best things that will ever happen to the city of [PERSON], to GPE2."
08_19_2015,homeless,"We can build buildings alongside this facility on the industrial land, possibly large manufactured buildings that can be used as temporary shelters, and also bring in the manufacturers to work with people, provide employment, provide ways that they can also utilize the space to build their products, to build. lift the homeless up and provide housing and shelter. It's a transitioning center to get people into permanent housing with the developers, and this bond will benefit at this time."
08_19_2015,houseless,"And we approve that in the budget, the 90,000 position in [ORGANIZATION]. And so with the remaining from that originally $380,000 that was budgeted, the unknown costs yet are going to be if there's an office build-out or if we have to move them to a different space to get that locking door private office, which is required by [ORGANIZATION]. And the focus groups, which the ORG2 has identified, to really hear from houseless communities, youth communities,  the LGBTQ communities who might not necessarily be reached in the [ORGANIZATION] required mailing survey to home addresses."
08_19_2015,homeless,"If you're going to offer up millions of dollars for simple citizen review boards and different accountability boards, then you might want to give cameras to  a group of citizens or even sponsor some paid cop watch groups that go around and film the police and how they deal with the mentally ill people and homeless people and all kinds of different people in this community that are disproportionately affected by police abuse and corruption and misconduct and [ORGANIZATION]  I can't even believe that you asked that question about why there needs to be certain focus groups to deal with members of the different communities. That really shows that you don't get it and that you are obviously not qualified to hold any position of power in this town if you can't even...  that different people are affected differently by the power structure and the police. I know it's easy for you to just be a rich white man in a [STREET] of power."
08_19_2015,homeless,"You come from a [STREET] of white supremacy and a position of power, and you can't understand how the rest of us are treated. Well, you know, [ORGANIZATION], I remember when you were saying you're going to go sleep with the homeless, you know. I think you should still do that and do it for [ORGANIZATION] with maybe not a G4S security guy to back you up."
08_19_2015,homeless,"You could...  probably find a couple of homeless people that would make sure you're safe or even more safe than your G4S security guys. But I suggest that [ORGANIZATION], that you go out and sleep in the streets too, and every one of you guys, and then you might have some perspective. Go do [ORGANIZATION] in the streets in the dead of [LOCATION]."
09_09_2015,affordable housing,"Yes. okay let's move on then please 921 request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding affordable housing and over building in [ORGANIZATION] [TIME] [PERSON] welcome so I started out with with some  Some things I found when I was going through the papers I had in the boxes of stuff I collected over [DATE], and I found this campaign thing of this guy named [PERSON]."
09_09_2015,affordable housing,People live on the [STREET] because they can't find affordable housing. I went through this myself [ORGANIZATION]. I talked to [ORGANIZATION] office about it.
09_09_2015,affordable housing,"if you'll see the the mayor and the Commissioner [PERSON] at that time he resigned shortly after that promises [ORGANIZATION] of community leaders to find new revenues for affordable housing at 50% or below the medium income guess who promised this you know besides the mayor and the commissioner skin a guy named private developer PERSON1 heard of him  He's still promising, and I saw the leader of [ORGANIZATION] at that time, the minister from [ORGANIZATION]. He said he's still telling us stories. He's still telling us, and we're buying them all the time, what he's going to do for affordable housing."
09_09_2015,affordable housing,"The rent for a single person over there is $1,100. Wow.  that's a hassle project over there which distance is it's nice for you guys you could afford that all of you could afford it an apartment like that but lots of schedule mr. [ORGANIZATION] and mr. [PERSON] didn't tell us the truth back then and the [ORGANIZATION] wrote me a letter PERSON2 wrote me letter saying that eventually we'll get affordable housing in the city eventually the whatever the hell does that mean two more pages will be done here it's that I don't I don't [TIME] is not very long  there's some priorities in this city that you should look at. I don't think that fixing the FAC0 and buying the post office are big priorities."
09_09_2015,homeless,"One of the only other issues I have within the city of [ORGANIZATION] is that we shouldn't deny the most vulnerable people to also have access to the transportation. And I'm not seeing enough passes being given to a lot of the homeless out through the city. And that kind of disturbs me because...  Of all the people that really need access to medical, to jobs, to going different locations, that would be the homeless."
09_09_2015,homeless,"And yet we give money to certain nonprofits that say to you, you need to tell us who you're going to see and we'll call them to verify that. But in my mind, having the people through the city that are the most vulnerable have access to go to different locations is very important to the city community.  from a beneficial of people getting more jobs, people having access to doctors, people being able to go to see their friends, their relatives. And because they are homeless, they're being denied that access because city leaders are not looking at that and saying, we think the students deserve to have these passes, but the most vulnerable people in this city do not."
09_09_2015,homeless,"So I question your decision, Dr.  on denying the homeless access to free passes on the transportation to improve their lives, possibly get a job, possibly get housing, possibly improve their health. So again, I just question your thinking on this, and I hope that you'll look at this a little bit closer and maybe decide to offer that to at least the, quote, 2,000 that we keep throwing that number out,  that are chronically homeless throughout this city. And again, even if you offered transportation [ORGANIZATION] [DATE] to this group, the benefits to them to be able to improve their lives would be enormous."
08_23_2017,homeless,"You know what? [LOCATION] homeless problems out here, we have problems. And you know what?"
08_23_2017,houseless,"I oppose this project simply because, number one, I don't understand how [ORGANIZATION] has the funding to make improvements that a neighborhood clearly does not want and nor can they afford, but they can't put in a crosswalk. And number two, I oppose it because every single time  you give the go-ahead for anybody in this city to develop or improve anything, the houseless get shuffled around, arrested, swept. Just on the [STREET] here [ORGANIZATION], we were watching cops harass houseless under the bridge on FAC0."
08_23_2017,housing crisis; houseless,"What?  I mean, it's ridiculous. So, I mean, where is [ORGANIZATION]'s plan when they come in and do this so that the impact isn't so traumatizing on the houseless in that area when they get shuffled around and moved again for an unnecessary improvement? Where is [ORGANIZATION]'s plan to reduce the impact on this neighborhood and whether or not they can afford these improvements, especially when we're sitting in the middle of a housing crisis?"
08_23_2017,houseless,"Right. Or is just everything in this city about money? Oh wait, it's not because we're still waiting on that $50 million for the houseless."
08_23_2017,houseless,"We know how the city works. And the city doesn't work for the people. The city works for builders, contractors, different forms of employment, taking away people's homes, all kinds of things that are egregious when the houseless aren't even getting the money that you aren't dealing with, Mr. [PERSON], until [ORGANIZATION], which was supposed to be started, I think, in [LOCATION] from the budget."
08_23_2017,houseless,"We don't want people drinking dirty water. But the [STREET] that we describe houseless people are as dirty, not myself. I don't describe them this [STREET]."
08_23_2017,houseless,"But the common language is they're filthy, they're broken, they're mentally ill, all kinds of things, meaning all...  all of which are similar to how we describe what's going on with sewer pipes. So I'm just saying, maybe we could look at the fact that we're so easy giving money for fixing sewer pipes, which we should be, but apply that to the ease of...  of giving money to fix the houseless problem so that people can have clean water, be clean, have a sense of cleanliness for themselves, be less broken so that they can get fixed through the systems that are here that also need fixing, but at least they're somewhat in [STREET] for people to get the therapies that they need, the addiction treatment that they need to avoid jail, to avoid issues of maybe having their dogs killed because they're living outside and they're not okay, and And I just want you guys to think about it."
08_23_2017,houseless,"You know, the similarity of how we talk about things and applying money to things and giving contractors money to fix things. I'm asking you to fix the houseless problem. I'm asking you to come up with the fix."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"Okay. All right, 698, please. Establish a construction excise tax to fund affordable housing initiatives from an inclusionary housing fund."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"Commissioner [PERSON]. Thank you, Mayor. As all of my colleagues know,  The lack of affordable housing is the greatest crisis facing our city right now, and the current market conditions are increasing the crisis."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"We have thousands of people literally living on our streets. We have unprecedented rent increases, more than 15% on average [ORGANIZATION] over [ORGANIZATION], the highest in the nation. The rising rents, coupled with extremely low vacancy rates, have made affordable housing options scarce for low- and middle-income Portlanders."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"And quite frankly, new development, both residential and commercial, is continuing to put more stressors on the need for affordable housing. We have worked hard in this city to ensure that jobs are located close to where people live. And I think that was one of our cornerstones of the comprehensive plan that we adopted [ORGANIZATION], is people need to be able to live near where they work."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"We have a documented need right now for 24,000 units of affordable housing, and that need is growing as the city continues to grow. In the comprehensive plan that we adopted [ORGANIZATION],  we acknowledge the need for an additional 10,000 units of affordable housing on top of that 24,000 units of need right now over [LOCATION]. New commercial and residential developments in the city must pay their freight towards supporting affordable housing, both commercial and residential development."
06_16_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,"And that's what we're presenting [ORGANIZATION] to you is a proposal to do exactly that,  we are proposing to establish a 1% commercial excise tax on residential construction and on commercial construction. This is not the solution to our housing crisis, but it is an important cornerstone of funding new affordable housing in the city of [ORGANIZATION]. Some of the other things this council has done is [PERSON] we increased the amount of urban renewal money dedicated to housing projects.  by nearly $67 million for affordable housing."
06_16_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,"DATE0, the council will consider an inclusionary zoning program for adoption, which will include some increases for developers, incentives for developers, excuse me, which this construction excise tax will provide some funding for. And I will be bringing to council a referral to the voters in [LOCATION] to ask them to help solve this affordable housing crisis even more.  by supporting a general obligation bond for affordable housing development. Our city's workers, our families"
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"And although [ORGANIZATION] is on leave, [PERSON], I know, worked [TIME] a day on this because I got calls from her after [TIME] and on [ORGANIZATION]. But specifically, Senator [PERSON] was the prime sponsor of [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], chair of ORG1 [ORGANIZATION].  ORG2 and Speaker PERSON4 were all directly involved in the details of this bill and the creation of the construction excise tax option for all cities and all counties in the state of [ORGANIZATION]. The underlying purpose was to tap the hydraulics of the private sector to deliver a wider spectrum of affordable housing than we could do with direct public financing."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"To summarize, the [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] provides for mandatory inclusionary zoning above 80% of the median family income, and it allows for and recognizes that the use of voluntary inclusionary zoning below 80% of MFI is statutorily permitted. At the same time, they lifted a preemption on the levying of local construction excise taxes for affordable housing. This authorized all cities and counties except for [ORGANIZATION], who had previously enacted a construction excise tax prior to the preemption."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"And the remaining 35% would be made available for affordable housing for households under 60% of the MFI. The commercial tax revenue, we are recommending that 100% be allocated to housing for households under 60% of the MFI. Just to clarify on that previous slide, for the residential, those percentages are set in state law?"
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"And so we're very confident with that legislative interpretation. With respect to exemptions, the first category are required state exemptions. Affordable housing at or below 80% of the median family income."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"As a council, you're providing incentives to contractors to provide affordable housing. It's the [ORGANIZATION] program. We think that this should work in concert with the [ORGANIZATION] program and recommend that households that are affordable for sale be exempt from the excise tax."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"Of that, 15% would be provided to [ORGANIZATION]. 50% would be made available for inclusionary zoning incentives, and 35% remaining for other affordable housing programs. And as you can see, of the commercial revenue, 100% would be allocated to affordable housing programs."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"So that's about $8 million per annum, and I think it's important to focus on per annum because some of the press have taken this slide to mean that it means $8 million over [ORGANIZATION], which is incorrect here. To put this in context, in the [ORGANIZATION]'s budget of $150 million, this would constitute about 7% of the total budget going forward. The other thing I'd like to say is that with the [ORGANIZATION]'s prior action having to do with short-term rentals, [ORGANIZATION], ORG2, which is taxing tourists for affordable housing, your efforts to harness the budget,  tax increment financing for affordable housing."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"The short-term rental funds, thanks to your approval of our [ORGANIZATION] budget, we're going forward with the securitization of that revenue with a revenue bond with the finance office [LOCATION]. That would generate, over DATE2, about $18 million. With respect to the residential inclusionary zoning incentives, using the trend analysis that [ORGANIZATION] prepared and that we've just summarized, we would generate between $47 and $57 million as offsets and an additional $31 to $41 million in affordable housing revenue for residential only."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,And then the commercial sector would be contributing between $45 and $55 million. So...  Each of these are important parts of the solution to affordable housing. The mandatory inclusionary zoning was contemplated in the [ORGANIZATION] comprehensive plan.
06_16_2016,affordable housing,The impact statement that accompanies the ordinance says –  The purpose of this legislation is to authorize a construction excise tax on residential and commercial development to fund the production and preservation of affordable housing at or below 60% MFI. I want to see if we can avoid confusion here because the ordinance talks [DATE] and below. The impact statement makes clear we're talking about 60 and below.
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"I don't want there to be a future council that gets confused. And for the record, [ORGANIZATION] at [ORGANIZATION], what I would –  offer on the first recital is that for the revenue that is sourced that the [ORGANIZATION] would be able to use for affordable housing production and preservation, the intent would be to be 60 and below, but the incentive fund associated with the mandatory inclusionary zoning program would be at both the 80 percent and below 80 percent levels. So, [PERSON], maybe at some later point, could you see if there is a friendly amendment to be acceptable to the sponsor that takes the very clear statement in the impact statement about the purpose of the legislation and just incorporates it into the ordinance?"
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"And we spent a lot of time, probably [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION] on this very point because we're not underwriting their projects. Therefore there's not a dollar for our dollar offset but there is a good faith effort in  In addition, in order to provide for affordability at or below 60% of median income, we can provide optional additional services, including density adjustments, expedited service for local permit processing, modification of height, floor, or other site-specific requirements, and  additional financial incentives, which would either allow us to increase the number of affordable housing units over and above the base of 20 percent, which the statute allows for, decrease the sale or rental price of affordable housing within the units, or  or build affordable housing units that are equal to or lower than 80% of [ORGANIZATION]."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"And then on the 35% that goes to affordable housing under the residential improvements and the 100% of the commercial improvements, Commissioner [PERSON] will be coming back with a recommendation of how those are allocated. Final question, there's a proposal that's been floated to create one or more exemptions for otherwise laudable purposes. The one that caught my attention is brownfields."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"I want to go back to the issue of classifying commercial, multifamily as either commercial or residential. And I want to start out by saying that unless somebody has some reason for not dedicating 100% of the commercial to affordable housing, that's where I start from because I do believe that tax is worth less when there's a nexus between the purpose of the tax and what you use it for and what's taxed. So given that...  Given that, and I haven't heard anybody else on the council saying that we shouldn't have 100% of the commercial going to affordable housing, although I think we have some discussion about what purposes that might be."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"Well, I think we should have some more discussion about that right now because –  We know that at least last time I checked, 40% of [ORGANIZATION]'s property taxes never come back to the [ORGANIZATION] area. And I'm, for one, I'm not happy about three-quarters of a million dollars a year going to do affordable housing in other parts of the state. If there's a possibility that by classifying multifamily as residential, that means that if we can keep it as commercial, that means all the money stays in [ORGANIZATION] and all that money can be used for affordable housing."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"The other concern I have is that the ordinance says that it's for production and preservation of affordable housing, the 50% of the commercial that's not dedicated specifically by the statute. And I'm wondering if there's an interest from the community and on the council for including operations as a potential use, operations of affordable housing. If we pass the general obligation bond to build a lot of publicly owned homes."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"affordable housing, we're going to need money to operate it from. And so I'd be interested in allowing future councils to decide how to use that money for affordable housing and broadening it just slightly. I understand the point."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"And so I would argue that we save the operations argument maybe for [ORGANIZATION] and focus on new affordable housing production 100%. Okay. Presumably, since this is a dedicated fund, [ORGANIZATION] of [ORGANIZATION] will be making a recommendation to future councils as to the allocation of the money."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"And even in a perfect world, the new affordable housing that might be funded by the bond that we haven't passed yet wouldn't be online for [ORGANIZATION], right? Right. i think i would like us to consider that at least okay more questions for [ORGANIZATION] if any all right"
06_16_2016,affordable housing,The key thing for me is that 96% of this commercial excise tax revenue be devoted to the production of affordable housing. The city did a great job. They worked hard with the state legislature to get inclusionary zoning done.
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"And I hope it all goes to where I think it should go, and that's to affordable housing. I think we're all agreed on that. I'm just trying to get more to go to affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"It's been described as being [ORGANIZATION]. In [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION] initiated a process to really analyze a broad range of housing and land use tools to ensure both an adequate supply and equitable distribution of affordable housing across the region. At that time, they had identified inclusionary zoning as one of those potential tools."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"So with SB [DATE], passed recently by the [ORGAN[ORGANIZATION]ATION] legislature, we've cracked open both inclusionary zoning and the construction excise tax. And I believe the intent all along by legislatures was that the [ORGAN[ORGANIZATION]ATION] be used towards affordable housing. I want to acknowledge, however, that with all this hard work, we are still far short of where we should be and where most other places are with [ORGANIZATION]."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"Many essential systems that serve the public are supported through impact fees by the [STREET] of SDCs, such as transportation and parks, but affordable housing doesn't have one. Collecting a construction excise tax in the midst of a booming housing market and reinvesting in our community's greatest needs is the right step to ensuring that our communities are accessible by the [STREET] of affordable homes. As a member of [ORGAN[ORGAN[ORGANIZATION]ATION]ATION] working to provide input on the city's development process for [ORGAN[ORGANIZATION]ATION], it's good to see that the city is moving quickly on the [ORGAN[ORGANIZATION]ATION], half of which is dedicated towards the incentive funds needed for when a mandatory [ORGAN[ORGANIZATION]ATION] policy is adopted in the future."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"It's good that we are maximizing the residential side of the tax as allowed under the state statute, and we are supportive of the city's efforts to move quickly to implement this revenue source for new affordable housing production and preservation. On the commercial side, however, while I can understand why it's also being capped at 1%, despite having no such limitation in state statute, I remain unconvinced that we're truly maximizing this revenue source. I look forward to the findings in the upcoming nexus study and financial feasibility study in the inclusionary zoning process to see if there's a basis for a higher tax rate."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"Many of [ORGANIZATION]'s members are the low-wage workers who will labor inside these new commercial buildings, yet are forced to live far from their jobs because of the lack of affordable housing. The impact of these developments in a hot housing market needs to be captured and maximized in every instance and quickly. Thank you, Commissioner [PERSON] and the team you've assembled to work on housing issues."
06_16_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"I recognize these conversations have moved quickly, and we appreciate your leadership during a crisis time and when inaction on housing policy results in real-life consequences for individuals and families. Overall, I'd like to impress upon [ORGANIZATION] that we need a comprehensive strategy to address housing affordability. We need a variety of policy tools working in concert to address the full spectrum of housing needs, from ending homelessness with investments in affordable housing infrastructure to ensuring that fair housing laws are upheld so that housing discrimination ends now, in our lifetimes, and isn't passed on to future generations."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"It really is [ORGANIZATION] to be able to talk to you about this first impact fee for affordable housing, essentially. Usually – so I'm [PERSON] with [ORGANIZATION]. We are a coalition of over 140 organizations [LOCATION]."
06_16_2016,homeless; housing crisis; affordable housing,"We're all the usual suspects, like the frontline workers in homeless services and the developers of affordable housing –  but we're also neighborhood associations and healthcare workers and educators and small businesses, because as you know, our housing crisis is impacting all of us. And at [ORGANIZATION], we're working to address the historic affordable housing crisis that has been before us. with our community members with the lowest incomes."
06_16_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,"And in order to address this part of the housing crisis, we know that the only solution to getting rents down to $200 and $300 and $400 a month, which is what is affordable to a senior on [ORGANIZATION] or a mom raising a couple of kids on a minimum wage job, the only [STREET] we can get rents at this level of affordability is by investing money. in the public infrastructure of affordable housing. and so that's what's very exciting about [ORGANIZATION] is we're for the first time saying affordable housing is part of our public infrastructure and like the infrastructure systems of parks and schools and roads we are going to make affordable we're going to add affordable housing to that list and give affordable housing its impact fee because we value it as part of the infrastructure that makes our community great for everyone and that's how we need to start building our city"
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"and i believe this is the right step So we at [ORGANIZATION] are calling for you to keep it 100 with the construction excise tax, and that means dedicating all 100% of this revenue to affordable housing. We're glad to hear that support."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"And I would just add that it doesn't all trickle down. We're not, the market is not building deeply affordable housing, and we can't leave it up to the market to stand aside and let the market or expect the market to be able to build these $200 and $300 and $400 apartments. We have to find the resources to invest in this public infrastructure, and this is one of them."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"Thank you. [ORGANIZATION] worked diligently on this legislation in [ORGANIZATION], and we are very excited to be here supporting the outcome of that legislation, including the construction excise tax, and we look forward to the proposal on inclusionary zoning. Affordable housing for our members who sit right in that middle income range between the 50% to 80% of MFI is absolutely critical."
06_16_2016,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], I spent some time with her recently. She works at [ORGANIZATION]. And she was homeless for [ORGANIZATION] because her landlord evicted her so that he could increase her rent."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"For the record, my name is [ORGANIZATION]. I'm Policy Director at [ORGANIZATION]. We're a statewide association of over 150 affordable housing and community development nonprofits, along with public housing authorities and lots of partners and advocates."
06_16_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,"And we're all working towards equitable, affordable communities across the entire state. So I really want to commend this entire council for the bold steps you've already taken to address the housing crisis here in the city of [ORGANIZATION]. And we're here to ask you to continue that by supporting this proposed construction excise tax and by committing to dedicating 100% of the funds to affordable housing."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"As the crisis continues to worsen, that those folks who can will pay into a new funding source for affordable housing. We know that strong and equitable communities have to begin with a staunch commitment to providing affordable housing opportunities. So we're here [ORGANIZATION] remembering the people who couldn't be here because they're leaving one job and heading out to another one just so they can continue to barely make ends meet."
06_16_2016,homeless,"Some of these housing services include our mobile housing program, where the team works with other agencies to try and house those who are currently homeless. We also have a school-based housing assistance program at [ORGANIZATION]. And also, lastly, we have a rental assistance program where we help families pay for their rent and help them achieve stability through different means."
06_16_2016,homeless; affordable housing,"And we have seen a huge need for affordable housing from our staff's interaction with thousands of community members in the immigrant refugee communities. We appreciate the efforts by the city and the county through [ORGANIZATION] initiative to house the homeless and adding hundreds of emergency beds in [ORGANIZATION] so that people have a safe [STREET] to sleep at [TIME]. Still, what we continue to see and hear [LOCATION] is families doubling up and couch surfing because they can't find affordable housing."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,Families have to move far away to find affordable housing. That causes them to be far away from their established support networks and causes their kids to have to constantly change schools. What they need is a permanent [STREET] to call home.
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"And what we need right now is a more permanent solution, a systemic long-term strategy to create more affordable housing through the construction excise tax and dedicating 100% of it to affordable housing. so that our vulnerable immigrant and refugee communities can find a [STREET] to call home and do not have to be displaced and removed from their communities again and again, so that as [ORGANIZATION] becomes a thriving city, our immigrant and refugee communities can thrive together with the city. So thank you for your support in keeping it 100."
06_16_2016,homeless,"We're insulting someone because they're homeless. You know, it's a sad thing. Mayor, just one other point."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"Members of the [ORGANIZATION], thank you for the opportunity to speak here [ORGANIZATION]. My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I'm co-chair of ORG1 with ORG2."
06_16_2016,housing crisis,"Good turnout. Good turnout. our members hail from all across [ORGANIZATION] they're as diverse as our city but the one thing that we've heard again and again as you have cutting across geographic and social boundaries is that the cost of housing in [ORGANIZATION] is too high you know this as well as anyone you've declared a state of emergency and we thank you for the commitment you've shown in taking concrete steps to ease our housing crisis but despite the gains made in [ORGANIZATION] both locally with the increase in tiff funding which we thank you for your support on  And at the state level, with the loosening of the inclusionary zoning restrictions, the housing situation here in [PERSON] continues to worsen."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"In [ORGANIZATION], that need is clear, and so we strongly support Commissioner [PERSON]'s proposal to allocate 100% of the construction excise tax money to housing. The money generated by the [ORGANIZATION] can't make up the difference, as you've noted, but it can help fill in gaps in our affordable housing infrastructure. Many [ORGANIZATION]ers cannot afford the workforce housing that inclusionary zoning is designed to provide, and most [ORGANIZATION]ers do not live in an urban renewal area eligible for [ORGANIZATION] funding."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"Now, how am I supposed to do that when I have, how am I supposed to keep my insulin refrigerated and keep my leg up when I'm sleeping out on the streets?  [ORGANIZATION] is really special, dear, and unique to me, but in a [STREET] I also have many patients like [ORGANIZATION], whose life circumstances preclude them from living happy and healthy lives. And these circumstances are so entangled with what we do in medicine, we call them the social determinants of health, that a colleague at [ORGANIZATION] and I started an initiative to organize patients and community partners to better identify and address these social determinants. In organizing meetings with over 60 patients [ORGANIZATION], we quickly found that the most prevalent and significant influence in the health and lives of our patients is lack of secure and affordable housing."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"And in a truly just society, we can all pursue health, wellness, and happiness. So here I sit in front of you asking you to help us, help [ORGANIZATION], help [ORGANIZATION].  by maximizing the funds for affordable housing. Thank you."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"Thank you. PERSON0, welcome. Mayor [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION], thank you for what you've done and what you will do to promote affordable housing here in [ORGANIZATION]."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"At our [ORGANIZATION] meeting [ORGANIZATION], we voted to support 100% of the construction excise tax going to affordable housing. And I hope you'll pass that [LOCATION]. resources for affordable housing are an important part of [ORGANIZATION] anti-displacement strategy."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] is doing a project called Baby Booster now to support pregnant women and families with young children because that helps them in their lifelong health. And when we talk to parents in the neighborhood, what they tell us is we need more affordable housing. That's what we can do to promote healthy babies."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"If you need another reason to vote for this, I'm just reading a book called [ORGANIZATION], and it's just a horror story of what happens when we don't have affordable housing in our city. So I hope you'll vote [ORGANIZATION] to adopt [ORGANIZATION] and devote 100% of that to affordable housing. Thanks very much."
06_16_2016,homeless,"Absolutely. Now, another commitment I hope that Mr. [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] will stand by is their proposal on the $100 million homeless campus. I hope that the city will also understand that they need to step forward on that FAC0 property."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I'm a leader with [ORGANIZATION]. Thank you. ORG1 leaders and others have testified about our position on the issues before you [ORGANIZATION] and some of the reasons why we believe 100% of the commercial construction excise tax should be devoted to affordable housing."
06_16_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,"For [ORGANIZATION], a ban on inclusionary zoning prevented construction of affordable housing on any meaningful scale in any city in our state. That ban has a large share of responsibility for the housing crisis that we stagger under DATE1. It was put in [STREET] in the interests of industry lobbies at the expense of our communities."
06_16_2016,housing crisis,"DATE0, our legislature considered a bill to finally lift the ban on [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON] testified in support of that bill, as did the city of [ORGANIZATION] and every other jurisdiction in [PERSON] who testified, along with a broad spectrum of other community nonprofits, all of whom feel the crushing effects of the housing crisis on the people and communities we serve. It's important here to recognize that some developers, we heard from one, responsible developers also went out of their [STREET] to testify in support of lifting that ban, the bill in its original form."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"So we were distressed to see a decent bill loaded up with amendments, weakened and constrained from accomplishing the good that was intended originally, and  The final legislation seemed, according to testimony in those hearings and questioning from [ORGAN[ORGAN[ORGANIZATION]ATION]ATION] members, the bill seemed to have, in its final form, seemed to have been shaped largely, again, in the interests of industry lobbies, in strong-arm deals without the presence of virtually any community voice. [ORGAN[ORGAN[ORGANIZATION]ATION]ATION] like ours were forced to hold our noses and urge passage of the legislation anyway, in favor of getting the chance for a little more affordable housing rather than no improvement at all. The bright spot, though, in the [ORGAN[ORGANIZATION]ATION] compromises was the ability to institute a construction excise tax and have some [STREET] to pay for affordable units for people earning below 80% of median family income, for which the final [ORGAN[ORGANIZATION]ATION] legislation made no provision at all."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"We urge you to ensure that here in [ORGANIZATION], no powerful industry interests will bring the [ORGANIZATION] rates to any level below 1%. The home builders and realtors lobbies already have their [STREET] with the state legislation, hampering our ability to begin closing the gap of dire need for more affordable housing. We hope you'll draw a line for [ORGANIZATION]ers and provide courage to other communities.  by establishing both residential and commercial [ORGANIZATION] rates at the maximum possible and with no additional exemptions."
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"I think there's other benefits and amenities to developing and locating in [ORGANIZATION] that make it beneficial for people who want to do that. I think ultimately when you're looking at these issues, they were very complicated. The property tax bond, the inclusionary zoning, the construction excise tax, demand management fees.  changes to far bonus systems changes in heights and different things like that that were contained in the comprehensive plan are complicated and they and they come together when somebody's looking at a potential development and wanting to just fully understand that is really was really our objective in our comments not that we have any fundamental opposition to a Support for affordable housing, which we agree is a tremendous need in the city."
06_08_2016,homeless,"to chemically dependent homeless adult chronic arrestees. PERSON0, we've already had a hearing on this, correct? Yes, so there's several items that we had to pull over from [ORGANIZATION] because they were emergencies we didn't have before."
06_08_2016,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] fritz thank you for being here and thank you for entertaining the amendment [PERSON] matter passes uh we're now going to proceed to [ORGANIZATION] item six four five amend contract with [ORGANIZATION] to add one hundred thousand dollars for the provision of permanent supportive housing for homeless veterans commissioner [ORGANIZATION]  I don't have any talking points on this, but this is something we have worked with ORG2, and they're doing a great job providing services for veterans, homeless veterans. I would urge adoption. Any questions from colleagues?"
06_08_2016,homeless,"Mr. [PERSON], welcome. Mr. [PERSON], come up forward. Shedrick [PERSON], and I don't know what this is about, but I was a homeless veteran when"
06_08_2016,homelessness,"Good morning, Commissioners. I'm pleased that given the scope of our homelessness crisis, we think that this $100,000 for [ORGANIZATION] will be sufficient. If you have a moment to – I guess it would be Mr. [PERSON]'s portfolio."
06_08_2016,homelessness,"So I do. On [ORGANIZATION], I had a meeting with [ORGANIZATION], who is here [LOCATION]. PERSON1 and I discussed lots of things, including homelessness, the state of design in the city, and other issues."
08_29_2018,homelessness,"Yet my family [ORGANIZATION], because city leaders seem more interested in partisanship and pet projects, is less safe [ORGANIZATION]. Respecting citizens includes trying to protect them from undocumented rapists and criminals, needles left in family yards and parks, and not inhibiting citizens and workers from moving about safely due to occupations and rampant homelessness. Thank you."
08_29_2018,homeless,"Aren't our taxes already paying for this frickin' crap? How is it that...  a certain percentage of the federal budget goes in to [ORGANIZATION], which runs a [ORGANIZATION], automated fingerprint identification system, should be fully funded by the federal government because God knows us they're not giving enough money to house homeless people. So why is it that we need a regional network, [ORGANIZATION], to gouge us for $20,000 a year  to get fingerprint records that should already be fully funded by the [PERSON], [PERSON], and [ORGANIZATION]."
08_29_2018,homeless,"The fact that they go around and create, or other agencies, interstate agencies, have said, here's an opportunity for us to get $20,000 a year from [ORGANIZATION] on a [ORGANIZATION] contract so that we can do something a little different with biometrics, but only fingerprints, according to the 14-page contract [ORGANIZATION]. So I really think that as police commissioner and as a bean counter police commissioner, it's very reasonable for you to look into why aren't [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] and PERSON2 delivering [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] that doesn't need for each municipality to cough up a little bit of extra money to get ABIS Plus or whatever this is that we're buying, right? It just doesn't make sense, especially from a federal government that says, oh, [ORGANIZATION], you have 10,000 homeless people?"
08_29_2018,homeless,"Good morning. My name is [ORGANIZATION], and my concern here is where the money goes. As far as I'm concerned, why don't you take that money, tell all the homeless people, here's this spot, and here's all the wood and all the material you need to make a little tiny house."
08_29_2018,homelessness,"So my concern is where the city money goes. And we're nationally known for our homelessness. I mean, it's all over the [STREET] about how bad [ORGANIZATION] is."
08_29_2018,homeless; houseless,"You know, when we talk about [ORGANIZATION], we should recognize it goes all the [STREET] out practically to FAC1 and that there are probably hundreds of our houseless neighbors sleeping there. So I think we all need to take a look and see what's in the city joint office of homeless, the city's budget and the joint office of homeless to make sure that those people are getting the assistance at removing their trash and maintaining the best quality of life you can when there's no homes for you. Thank you.  Very good."
06_05_2019,homelessness,The 14th request of [ORGANIZATION] to this council regarding homelessness. Is Mr. [PERSON] here [ORGANIZATION]? I do not see him.
06_05_2019,homeless,"So we tend to think we've been here a while. We lived in FAC0 for DATE0, and as of [LOCATION], we kept asking city council to help us out with the homeless problem, the drug addicts that were peeing our yards, pooping our yards, stealing our things, camping in our driveways, and with no response, no help at all. Basically, the last communication was Either they go or we do."
06_05_2019,affordable housing,I remember [PERSON] when there wasn't one bit of trash on the ground. I own property at [ADDRESS]. And I bought the property to build affordable housing.
06_05_2019,affordable housing,"After the zone change was made, I've been in here several times asking, can you please give me back what I bought? Because I bought this for a specific reason to build affordable housing. I don't do industrial."
06_05_2019,affordable housing,approval pipeline. That means that there is now a minimum of 398 units of affordable housing in otherwise what would be market rate housing. And so I just want to note this for my colleagues that we are starting to see considerable movement in the inclusionary housing pipeline and this would be just one more example.
06_05_2019,housing crisis,"We know beyond a doubt that short-term rental platforms are contributing to a global housing crisis, including our housing crisis right here in [ORGANIZATION]. The city implemented some common-sense regulations to try to mitigate those impacts on our rental markets as well as protect consumers and neighborhoods, but given that... Thousands of houses, rooms, and ADUs that were formerly rented out long-term are now on the short-term rental market."
06_05_2019,housing crisis,"There is, again, no denying that it is impacting and accelerating our housing crisis. And the denial of these platforms, in particular [ORGANIZATION], which is the only group that I have met with, would be laughable if it weren't so offensive. So I'm going to support... aggressive regulation and enforcements because we need to take care of our residents and our neighborhoods."
06_05_2019,housing crisis,"We're concerned about privacy considering the bad behavior that can result from making the registry public, including transactional data. But we've been assured by the revenue division and the mayor's office that at least the financial information will be kept completely confidential. Overall, we support the ordinance because it seems to be a path towards removing unpermitted listings, especially unpermitted whole house listings that would affect the housing crisis."
06_05_2019,housing crisis,"We wonder why the city would allow this type of conversion, or at least why it might be done easily or quietly in the midst of this housing crisis. And if there's not a formal, transparent policy governing these conversions, we recommend that one be developed. And now I'd like to ask [ORGANIZATION] to personalize the story."
06_05_2019,homelessness,"Our organization is growing and we are continuing to engage our hosts with best practices, community engagement, and [ORGANIZATION] meetups. DATE1, we have a planned panel on homelessness and engaging stakeholders to bring holistic perspective to the sensitive and complicated concern facing our city. We are also committed to highlighting a local experience for our guests, and we are launching a local guidebook that shares the best of the best in our city beyond the 15 neighborhoods commonly marketed to."
06_05_2019,affordable housing,"And that's where our families are, communities of color are, It's where affordable housing in low and moderate income households live in that housing. But we also, in doing so, [STREET] vulnerable populations on our busiest streets. And so those are the streets where the pedestrian crashes are the highest and most likely to occur in injury and death for the pedestrians or bicyclists in those areas."
06_05_2019,affordable housing,"If it does not involve careful planning and strong and empowered community engagement like you did in the development process, New investment in infrastructure, public transportation can make surrounding neighborhoods more desirable, raising property values and spurring the conversion of affordable housing to higher end units. This trend can lead to displacement of existing residents and minority owned community businesses and can particularly affect renters. Leaving a neighborhood can mean not just leaving a home, but often social networks and community culture as well."
06_05_2019,affordable housing,"We encourage more coordination of this plan with the housing bond planning that is taking on a city level but also on a regional level. And we also want to ensure that new affordable housing prevents the displacement of our communities from the places this plan targets. Finally, I would like to say that another recommendation as a city continues, and I think this also addresses to a couple of the questions that were mentioned earlier on funding mechanisms, is that we need to be bold when it comes to that."
09_20_2018,affordable housing,"So how big of a definition of public works contracts are we employing here? Are we getting at everything that truly has public money in it? Affordable housing projects, FAC0 corridor, urban renewal project –"
09_20_2018,affordable housing,"So...  I understand that with CM1, there's extra FAR for affordable housing but no bonus height. And the possibility was raised at the last hearing as to whether or not this development could have an additional height allowance, which would let them have ground for commercial and two stories of residential. That's just not an option for whatever reason."
09_05_2018,homelessness,"Next individual, please. 929, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding paradigm shift on approach to homelessness. Good morning, sir."
09_05_2018,homeless; homelessness,"I was also the former mayor of [ORGANIZATION]. So I want to talk to you about pretty much just giving my opinion on the homelessness. DATE0, before the homeless sweep at FAC0, I made friends with the homeless community."
09_05_2018,homeless,"I told him that most, okay, I was able to put a long-time heroin user into a home with a family. I love my homeless neighbors. I also had the safest business in town."
09_05_2018,homeless,"On one side, and there was no fence separating my property with the homeless camp, was just a few feet away. It was just right there, lots of homeless people, and $100,000 [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] right on the other side. And I had no problems."
09_05_2018,affordable housing,"I only met two families who didn't appear on drugs, to be on drugs. Shelters and affordable housing  I want to hear this right because I don't want to be combative. Shelters and affordable housing is like giving pain meds to someone with an infected foot, hoping the infection goes away."
09_05_2018,homelessness,"We must deal with the infection. I just have some suggestions, but I haven't delved down deep into how the city operates as far as homelessness, but I see certain things that have raised a concern. First one, correctly identify the problem."
09_05_2018,affordable housing,"Small drug dealers, big drug dealers, they're all the same to me. Give [ORGANIZATION] a reputation of a bad [STREET] to be if you're going to sell drugs. If possible, reappropriate money away from affordable housing and build prisons to incarcerate the dealers through due process, of course."
09_05_2018,housing crisis,"I'm here to talk to you regarding the issue and one that you can act on [ORGANIZATION]. Okay. Yes, we are in a housing crisis here in [ORGANIZATION]."
09_05_2018,homeless,"And if anyone's going to do that, when we're talking fiscal responsibility, if we're talking more money going toward the homeless and getting more people off the sidewalks and getting more people into housing, there has to be a balance created. Somebody has to make a stand, and that's a tough stand to make. And trust me, you'll...  You could very well end up having a special counsel in [ORGANIZATION] overlooking you when you make those kind of moves."
09_05_2018,affordable housing,"Thank you, [ORGANIZATION]. And colleagues, I am due at [ORGANIZATION]  alliance. DATE0 we are taking a vote on affordable housing, so I'm going to make sure I'm there for it."
09_05_2018,affordable housing; beggar,"Going forward, the City will continue to work closely together to develop timelines and milestones to ensure that we're delivering on these commitments. My office convened participating bureaus for an initial implementation meeting [ORGANIZATION] and will be holding another in [LOCATION]. In addition to addressing issues related to flooding, the city's commitment in the declaration also include measures to help create jobs, preserve affordable housing options for residents, and enhance and improve community access to natural areas such as [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]."
09_05_2018,homelessness; affordable housing,"To highlight some of the real results we've seen here, part of the concern here was that with [ORGANIZATION] trying to get to cost recovery with flood insurance, people have their flood insurance rates screaming out that  significant rates. And so you have the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood, which is the most diverse part of the city, I think, and also has a lot of naturally occurring affordable housing. And the city saw an opportunity and the collaborative saw an opportunity to help people before they are on the track toward homelessness, to keep people in their homes proactively."
09_05_2018,beggar,"The city spent $16 million, for example, on [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], removing 33 acres from the floodplain in that area. That's the kind of commitment that I think we in [PERSON] would like to see. I would like to see the council talk about [PERSON]'s [PERSON] moving forward."
09_05_2018,affordable housing,"You all know it. You've seen our town center with the new buildings, the new businesses, the affordable housing, and no copper penny. And with the exception of crime, [ORGANIZATION] is a better [STREET] to live than [ORGANIZATION]."
09_05_2018,beggar,"I just have a comment. Thank you all for your work on this, and it is a great project. And, Mr. [PERSON], fun fact about [PERSON]'s [PERSON], we have a contract with [ORGANIZATION] for parks to manage it, but [ORGANIZATION] doesn't give us any money to do so."
09_05_2018,homeless,"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me. I lift my lamp beside the golden door."
09_05_2018,beggar,"I mean, the obvious one is what Commissioner [PERSON] alluded to [TIME], which is the beggar's tick master plan. You know, you've got now two of the three key partners now unified. [ORGANIZATION] needs to be brought to the table."
09_05_2018,houseless,"The [ORGANIZATION] facilitators began this work in [ORGANIZATION]. They took a trauma-informed approach to outreach and prioritized outreach to people with mental health conditions, people with a disability, youth, the houseless community, the LGBTQ community, immigrants and refugees, and the black, native, and [ORGANIZATION] communities. We received over 100 applications for the [ORGANIZATION] board."
09_05_2018,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] has worked as a direct line social worker, empowering residents living in supportive housing, as a homeless outreach worker advocating for some of [ORGANIZATION]'s most vulnerable residents, and as a mobile mental health crisis response worker for [PERSON]. The [ORGANIZATION] facilitators began work on [ORGANIZATION]. With a limited amount of time, they hit the ground running."
06_29_2016,homeless,"Well, let's suspend the rules and hear it for [ORGANIZATION]. Thank you. You should talk about the war on the homeless that [ORGANIZATION] does all the time."
06_29_2016,homeless,"Yeah, the transportation of homeless camps. What about rape while at the camp? Okay, I issued a warning earlier about interruptions, that the next interruption will recess and you'll be excluded."
06_29_2016,homeless,"So, hi, my name's [ORGANIZATION]. I'm [PERSON] from [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], and I'm here to address about my [ORGANIZATION] project. So, my [ORGANIZATION] project is making care packages for the homeless people of [ORGANIZATION]."
06_29_2016,homeless,"It has a bit of a personal story to me. You see, when I was a young boy, I've always wanted to help the homeless people out, yet I had no idea how. And [DATE], my mom took me and my brother down to FAC0 to serve the homeless people breakfast."
06_29_2016,homeless,"And I thought it was really nice seeing the homeless people get an incredibly tasty breakfast. Sorry, sorry, I'm just... Now, during this period of me serving at [ORGANIZATION], I was also part of ORG1, as you're already aware of."
06_29_2016,homeless,"And I became [PERSON] after all my hard work I've done. And when I was [PERSON], I was told that I had to perform a project which benefits the community. So I chose making care packages for the homeless people because I thought of the homeless people"
06_29_2016,homeless,"The new home for FAC0 is a project that the city invested in. And so the apartments on the top floor were paid for by the city and by the taxpayers because that's how much we think of that program. And to the project that you described,  I would just note that it was students at [ORGANIZATION] that originally had the vision, as you know, for serving food to homeless people."
06_29_2016,homeless,"let's hear it again. Let's ask Mr. [PERSON] to come forward, 733. Request of Robert [PERSON] to address council regarding unslightly garbage and growing number of homeless tents."
06_29_2016,homeless,"We depend on you to anticipate and solve problems in this great city. We have seen in our city over [ORGANIZATION] a growing problem with homeless people that has resulted in a growing number of homeless tents in unauthorized areas,  the growth of unsightly garbage along highways, even homeless sleeping downtown [ORGANIZATION] and using our sidewalks and streets as their personal toilet. It is the responsibility of our elected officials to have anticipated this problem and find solutions wherever they may be and apply those solutions to the homeless problem before they reach the level that it has in our city."
06_29_2016,homeless,"If the homeless problem was a test to date, you would have received a failing grade. I do want to thank you, however, for the opportunity to address you about these concerns. I know I have some time remaining and would like you to provide some assurances that this problem will be solved."
06_29_2016,affordable housing,"Thank you for your testimony. We do have a plan and we need to be able to fund it. So [ORGANIZATION] we're going to be voting on a construction excise tax, and then [LOCATION] looking at a bond measure to pay for affordable housing."
06_29_2016,affordable housing,"And a lot of time with planners and getting to know them and talking and I  The research and the real desire of this city to grow in a really smart and equitable [STREET], I just think it's wonderful, and especially from everything from affordable to design issues and bringing everyone together. There was a small part of the comprehensive plan relating with residential infill, and I know that many of my neighbors have gotten a bit stirred up because there's a lot of mystery, and mystery is always uncertain.  and recently became public. As a millennial with a family and at the upper edge of the millennials, and there are many millennials following me with families, one thing that we are concerned about is affordable housing for families."
06_29_2016,affordable housing,"I wanted to  and comment on this article that really tries to address head-on some of the prevalent myths and I think false choices out there that surround some of these policy issues around trees. And I'll also highlight some of the really reforms that are still needed to kind of address those issues that those, I think, false choices bring up around, you know,  between trees and the [ORGANIZATION] and affordable housing, between reaching the city's development goals."
06_29_2016,affordable housing,"Let's do 771 next, please, while everyone's here. Second reading and a roll call vote, please.  [DATE], would you read that and let us vote? Establish a construction excise tax to fund affordable housing initiatives from an inclusionary housing fund."
06_29_2016,housing crisis,"PERSON0? Commissioner [PERSON], under your leadership, we're asking everybody in our community to dig deep to help solve this housing crisis. This is one of a number of initiatives you brought forward."
06_29_2016,affordable housing,"Well, as my colleagues well know, the lack of affordable housing is the greatest crisis facing our city right now, and the current market conditions are only increasing the crisis. New development, both residential and commercial, is continuing to put more stressors on the need for affordable housing. A minimum wage worker in [ORGANIZATION] would need to pay 100% of her income to pay the rent on the average newly built apartment in [ORGANIZATION]."
06_29_2016,affordable housing,"Thank you, [ORGANIZATION] legislature, and thank you, [ORGANIZATION] and her team. I'm also pleased that all of the revenue raised through this tax will go to build and preserve affordable housing. As some of the commenters said [ORGANIZATION], we're keeping it 100."
06_29_2016,affordable housing,"As we know all too well, affordable housing is a dire need in [ORGANIZATION]. Housing is becoming more expensive for everyone, middle- and low-income families alike. This is a serious problem that threatens to turn [ORGANIZATION] into a [STREET] where only the wealthy can afford to live."
06_29_2016,affordable housing,"During the comprehensive plan discussions, I've spoken about the need to build more housing and allow more flexibility in the single-family zone so we can get more diversity of kinds of housing to meet the needs of families. Just as important, though, is building subsidized affordable housing units to ensure housing is available for low-income families, especially in our most desirable neighborhoods that are close to jobs and excellent public transit. That's why I'm happy [ORGANIZATION] to support this measure."
06_29_2016,affordable housing,"Through this action [ORGANIZATION], we're dedicating revenue for this tax to building and preserving affordable housing for people earning below 60 percent of median family income. That's where the biggest need is, and this tax isn't going to solve the whole problem. It's a big step in the right direction."
06_29_2016,affordable housing,"I do want to take [TIME], though, to talk about a concern this ordinance raises for me. We have received testimony expressing concerns about the cost of this proposal for development. As a standalone proposal, I think this construction excise tax is well calibrated and the need for affordable housing is great."
06_29_2016,affordable housing,"If we put the brakes on too many new projects, we'll fossilize this supply of housing, pushing prices for everyone up. There is a balance. The revenues from this construction excise tax proposal will build new affordable housing, and that is a good thing."
06_29_2016,affordable housing,"Aye. PERSON0? I just want to say the following six items, 764 through 770, are all projects that are increasing the supply of affordable housing."
06_29_2016,affordable housing,"Private sector developers.  have stepped up but it also they've stepped up because [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] have increased the amount of tax revenue they're willing to forego in order to have this affordable housing produced so all told we're going to get over 105 over 100 units of new affordable housing from these uh seven six developments hi PERSON0 hi Okay, next. 765, approve application under the multiple unit limited tax exemption program for FAC0 located at [ADDRESS]."
06_29_2016,housing crisis,"Aye. PERSON0? Well, just as it won't take just one housing strategy to deal with our housing crisis, it won't take just one opportunity strategy to deal with the income inequality and the differences in opportunity in our city. So this is one piece of that strategy."
06_29_2016,affordable housing,"Both parties agreed that making some modifications would be mutually beneficial in light of the city's new plan. [ORGANIZATION] also learned more about impactful ways of addressing digital equity and is focused on working with affordable housing providers like ORG1 and working with libraries and nonprofits to expand capacity to address affordability, devices, and digital literacy training. As is usually the case, we arrived at this point DATE0 thanks to a team effort, and I'd like to thank PERSON0 of ORG2 and [PERSON] and PERSON2 of my office, as well as PERSON3 with Commissioner [PERSON] and PERSON5 of ORG3."
08_10_2017,affordable housing,"So this was pre-IZ, so there's no affordable housing component to this. It's got office and retail on the ground floor, retail everywhere, and then office on the two smaller buildings. The residential tower outlined there in red is 250 feet."
08_10_2017,affordable housing,"yeah Does your concern about height and scale with these three buildings, do you have the same concerns about the FAC0? The FAC0 being a tower with affordable housing development adjacent to it, and I'm guessing the FAC0 is more than 250 feet, although I don't have a map."
09_20_2017,houseless,"I get it. I've been punched in the gut by your decision since [ORGANIZATION], DATE1 of your charade as a mayor who ran on a platform to house the houseless and create police transparency. You abused our houseless with your games and injure and kill our community with your cops."
09_20_2017,houseless,"Man, that was cold. You've stolen money, directed specifically to house the houseless. You've allowed sweeps in the houseless instead."
09_20_2017,homeless,"Thank you, sir. Next item, please. Item [DATE], request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding the homeless and tolerance."
09_20_2017,housing crisis,"As this council secures money for transportation, whether from our city's coffers or through your requests for funding from your partners in [ORGANIZATION], you have the opportunity to invest in your state of priorities, safety, livability, climate, and reducing the related cost of housing and mobility. When looking at what [PERSON] secured from its partners in [ORGANIZATION], one would think that we have a $450 million single-location fender-bender crisis in this town. In fact, we have a crisis of transportation deaths, and we have a housing crisis made worse by insufficient transportation options, particularly for those living in East [PERSON]."
09_20_2017,affordable housing,I also am very concerned about affordability. I'm concerned about affordable housing and I'm concerned about affordable commercial space. And if we do not make it feasible for  developers and people who are redeveloping their buildings to have incentives to keep the affordability in [STREET] then we're not going to get the affordability that we need both from a residential position and from a commercial space position.
09_20_2017,affordable housing,"Finally, I want to say that freeway expansion has never solved traffic congestion, and we are proud to stand with a broad coalition of community-based organizations and citizens who are asking for removal of the [ORGANIZATION] project from the transportation plan. Well, there might be localized benefits to the project. We believe it would come with a very high opportunity cost and would divert much-needed city dollars from other important initiatives like housing, affordable housing, better transit, and [STREET] improvements in the outer east side of [ORGANIZATION]."
09_16_2015,homeless,"But also, I heard these [ORGANIZATION] people say,  are here [ORGANIZATION] to present, you know, more proof on the lawlessness and all the other stuff involved with homeless people, supposedly, you know, as they price everyone out of the city and wage war and gentrification. You know, well, [PERSON]...  is the anniversary of [ORGANIZATION], you know? And I'd like to give a thumbs up to the [ORGANIZATION] and all the other yuppie scum in this city that made the death possible of [ORGANIZATION] by...  you know, being little cop callers that call the police on every little thing."
09_16_2015,homeless,"I see a myriad of problems that plague the area. I want to clarify that I'm not at odds with the homeless. What I'm concerned with is twofold, the deplorable conditions these people live with [ORGANIZATION] and the burden placed upon business owners by allowing these conditions to persist."
09_16_2015,homeless; homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION] has become a magnet for homelessness. With the most lax laws regarding public nuisance behavior and an underfunded police force, we are the destination for homeless travelers, not just on [ORGANIZATION], but in the entire country. We need a two-pronged solution to the problem."
09_16_2015,homeless; homelessness,"They've cut homelessness by over 70% in [ORGANIZATION]. I know budgetary concerns are first and foremost, but it has been proven that getting people off the [STREET] is cheaper than having them be homeless. To conclude, what we need is increased social services, including beds, to get people off the streets immediately."
09_16_2015,homelessness,"I just want to make one comment. You said earlier that we're a magnet, and when [ORGANIZATION] was mayor,  he had a 12-point plan and homelessness. And part of the plan, they addressed this question about whether if the city invested in services and housing for low-income people, we would, in effect, become a magnet, or the critics used to call it the welcome mat phenomenon."
09_16_2015,affordable housing,And so we are striving to site stations near affordable housing and service centers. So thank you very much for sticking with me for all that. I'm obviously very excited about this.
09_16_2015,affordable housing,"in [ORGANIZATION], the largest affordable housing developer in [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION], and [ORGANIZATION], which is an operator of fitness clubs across the country. So with this backing, we really have the resources to ensure the stability, investment, and innovation to make our government partners happy and make our customers happy. Next slide."
09_16_2015,affordable housing,"Many of you know him already. He's a longtime [ORGANIZATION] resident, land use attorney, also a well-known advocate for affordable housing. He and I have known each other in a couple of capacities for longer than either of us will admit [ORGANIZATION]."
09_16_2015,affordable housing,"and i know [ORGANIZATION] to be fearless and as you noted [PERSON] was and continues to be a fearless advocate for low-income families and affordable housing, and he's a person of very strong values and principles. And what I love about PERSON2 is that it's because of his strong principles that he is often someone asking the questions that no one else is willing to ask in [ORGANIZATION]."
09_16_2015,affordable housing,"Thank you, Mr. [PERSON]. This is a multi-application, the [ORGANIZATION] tax exemption for building affordable housing. The developer originally planned to do 100% of the units at 60% of median family income."
09_16_2015,affordable housing,"In this instance, we're still well above the 20% floor of affordable housing that we require. And you've indicated that  this would be an eligible project under the new rules and still would have competed favorably under the old rules so those are the unique circumstances which will allow me to support your request thanks any other questions then does anyone want to speak on this item we have mr [ORGANIZATION] signed up thank you both come on off [ORGANIZATION] good morning [PERSON] is [ORGANIZATION] i represent [ORGANIZATION] watchdog PERSON2 basically  the concerns that commissioner PERSON3 brought up on starting out at the 100 and then going through the design process and you've made some major changes to the overall unit mix from the two bedrooms down to more ones and also going to the two buildings uh the only concern i have on here is that obviously you're still within the 20 percent guidelines  the affordable housing at the 60% MFI."
09_16_2015,affordable housing,"And when we have a drop, I didn't even do the math to know exactly how many units we're losing here, but I hope that you will find a [STREET] to empower yourselves to wrangle these people back to the table and tell you what their vision is, how they're going to make up, I mean, not contractually, but just morally, the...  make up for this loss of affordable housing. We thought we were going to get it."
09_16_2015,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION]? I appreciate the discussion, and I do hearken back to [ORGANIZATION]'s work session we had on the cost of affordable housing And, you know, note that one of the issues that came up was how design commission review can increase the cost."
08_05_2020,housing crisis,"And as I mentioned, it's not just the existence of the camp, which generally speaking, we don't have an issue with. We understand that we have a housing crisis. There are a lot of peaceful campers there and they're respectful, but there are some people that maybe are not,  being respectful, and some adjacent activities that have been a result because of it, including drug deals that have been going down in broad daylight [ORGANIZATION] when needles are provided as our cans."
08_05_2020,homelessness,And what we would like is that if the city would be able to come and see the issues for themselves and help facilitate a solution involving all who are impacted because the neighborhood association is not equipped to act as a convener in this multi jurisdictional nightmare  And [ORGANIZATION] has not been helpful. The situation has gotten much worse because we had a double stabbing recently. You probably have seen the reports about that.
08_05_2020,homelessness,"I'm happy to be here and I represent the voices of several people, including myself. I'd like to discuss some of what is being experienced nightly. I am in the streets of [ORGANIZATION] as [ORGANIZATION] attempts to rise out of a quagmire of severe police and other public official brutality, as well as a rising homelessness crisis and the entwined issues of drug addiction and mental health."
08_05_2020,affordable housing,"Thank you all for your patience.  flexibility and your understanding as we manage through this difficult situation to do the city's business [ORGANIZATION] we have one item [ORGANIZATION] pertaining to the residential in full project item six for eight if you could please read that for us mm-hmm amend the comprehensive plan comprehensive plan map  zoning map, Title 33 planning and zoning, and Title 30 affordable housing to revise the single dwelling residential designations and base zones.  Very good. And prior to each and every one of these hearings, we've all declared whether or not we have any conflicts of interest. I have indicated that I'm a renter, that I have no conflicts of interest."
08_05_2020,affordable housing,"Just to help everybody reoriented on the proposals, the intent of the residential infill,  project amendments is to allow for more housing in different kinds of housing and zones that currently only allow single dwelling units. The project now includes a bonus if you build affordable housing and connects to the historic resources code project update to help guide growth, specifically in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood. We heard public testimony in [ORGANIZATION] that  We held two work sessions to more fully develop amendments to the proposed draft of the residential infill project based on the testimony that we heard."
07_15_2015,homeless,"God bless [PERSON] for giving me good health insurance. Otherwise, I'd be back in the hospital and those cars wouldn't be working on the streets. When I first came and spoke to you all, I mentioned that I sponsor now formerly homeless individuals into our industry so they can get back up on their feet and have housing."
07_15_2015,homelessness,"I joked to you that I may myself return to homelessness if this  pilot period went through. I think that's a bit more of a reality than it is just me playing with words. It's really bad out there for us, and I'm hoping that you will take the trials and tribulations your full-time taxi drivers are experiencing to heart when you consider continuing an uncapped pilot project such as this."
07_15_2015,homeless,These programs are allowing the officers with [ORGANIZATION] to have a more unique and intimate interaction with the community and tourists who are visiting the downtown core. The walking beat has been seen as an opportunity for [ORGANIZATION] to help mend relations with the homeless community. The mounted patrol continues to provide a unique experience for the tourists visiting the [ORGANIZATION] metro area while still providing for their safety and security.
07_15_2015,homelessness,"The next item is community action programs. For those of us that work in the public safety field, we recognize the fact to address the community's greater issues versus simply employing incarceration. A recent topic from the advisory committee was converting [PERSON] facility as a treatment center for people suffering from homelessness, mental illness, or substance abuse."
07_15_2015,homeless,"DATE0, I looked at the city council hearing and I didn't see anything that I was going to come down and testify on. DATE0 [TIME], all over the media, it was talking about what you're going to do with the property, move a homeless camp into the property. I'll relocate a homeless camp into the property."
07_15_2015,homeless,"I again DATE0 went back and looked at the council agenda, and this seemed to be the connection. PERSON0, again, we're going to hold a hearing in the future if the council moves forward with putting a homeless camp. I understand that."
07_15_2015,homeless,"I was also going to talk about just issues we have with homeless camps. You did link that with the  press releases that went out and so now we're not allowed to testify about it. We feel there hasn't been a process that involved the whole community in terms of bringing in experts,  public planners and the community at large to do a legitimate planning process that's the basis of a lot of our planning so we feel that it's very premature"
07_15_2015,houseless,"However, I would like to make some things I observed here. I don't agree in sexist statement that was made earlier against [ORGANIZATION], Commissioner [ORGANIZATION] Fritz. I don't agree with the [STREET] the houseless community was treated when they tried to come in here."
07_15_2015,houseless,"I support the city buying the piece of land. We still, as a board, have to decide where we're going based on the needs of the houseless community. But I would like to echo that every time the houseless community, as we've done, has shown that we can self-organize in a safe manner."
07_15_2015,homeless,"And so I just, it's difficult to come to a hearing and find that people who I think do support Right to Dream 2 haven't come to necessarily ask us our position on this. And then people who don't support it don't support it just because of a homeless phobia, it looks like, you know. And I'd like people to just, again, open their hearts and their minds to the fact that  people need a safe [STREET] to rest."
07_15_2015,homeless,"I thought you were next. Yeah, my name is [ORGANIZATION]. I'm a homeless advocate."
07_15_2015,homeless,"One of the things that I always hear as a homeless advocate is why are these empty spaces out there when we have homeless people out on the streets? You know, one of the things we can do is  work together and get some creative minds together of how to utilize these proposed lands. Just in the [TIME] count, which they do [ORGANIZATION] or [LOCATION], you'll see the numbers of the homeless people out there."
07_15_2015,homeless,"I am also a board member of [ORGANIZATION], and I am obviously in support of buying these properties. I think that it is a good [STREET] to deal with a very sad situation that the city has as far as a homeless community goes, and that's really all I have to say. Thank you very much."
07_11_2018,affordable housing,"My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I'm here to speak about some alternatives for the housing situation. And what I'm proposing is something along the lines of these affordable housing units that we have going up now, you know, 500 units or so in a chunk, possibly connected to a vertical garden where these people can raise all the food that they're going to need and more. Associated with a store, they can sell their produce."
07_11_2018,soup kitchen,"They're bringing in income. It's going to be a sustainable, repeatable solution. Instead of reinventing the wheel every time, soup kitchen here and little houses there, we can do several of these communities that eventually, hopefully, will pay for themselves."
08_28_2019,homeless,"I don't see him. Next individual please. 793, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding homeless emergency."
08_28_2019,unhoused,"It's been DATE0 I've been talking to the council about the unhoused. Anyway, I want to start out thanking my heroes, okay? First one is named PERSON0."
08_28_2019,unhoused,"Hopefully the city will cave in again and we can house people. You saw, everybody saw the stats about all the unhoused, right? I talked about this for a long time, okay."
08_28_2019,unhoused,"We need a safety valve, okay? It is, from my perspective, unacceptable in a culture to have this many people unhoused. Obviously, to those that are rulers, have decided it's acceptable because it does exist."
08_28_2019,homeless,"I know you've all read it. This article printed [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION]. And again, in ORG1, reads 38,000 homeless people in this area."
08_28_2019,homeless,"This is how much this meant to me. I wrote a book and a detailed outline of my vision to shift the energy from non-functioning homeless individuals into productive, thriving families and communities by [STREET] of a group called [ORGANIZATION]."
08_28_2019,homeless; homelessness,"This is not a homeless management plan, but an end to homelessness. No more people on the streets. Hungry and cold children will be safe and in clean surroundings."
08_28_2019,homeless,"Hi, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]. I agree, no closed-door meetings. I agree, survivors to sit in on board meetings."
08_28_2019,homeless,What we really need is money spent for homeless people to participate in arts projects in the park. And we need to have [ORGANIZATION] stop participating in what I call [ORGANIZATION]-like behavior with locking the bathrooms down when homeless people show up. Thank you.
08_28_2019,homeless,"Okay. So [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]. So I guess they've had more overrun-offs recently."
08_28_2019,homeless,"As a city partnered non-profit, they do work with [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and ORG2. Additionally, [PERSON] here at [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION] and [ORGANIZATION], requested ORG5 be on the list, and therefore I would like to offer this as an amendment. Second."
08_28_2019,homeless,"What we're proposing is to suspend that rule for [ORGANIZATION] so that [ORGANIZATION] can go back and create a more equitable process for some of these nonprofits. We did an analysis again [ORGANIZATION] and found that 68 of our applied nonprofits did not pass that 25% rule, and many, many of them are. are organizations that work with minorities, the disadvantaged, the homeless, animals, the environment."
08_28_2019,housing crisis,"Because every rental that's taken off the long-term rental market and put into short-term creates more pressure on our rental market, and we're in the midst of a housing crisis. So the question remains, is there a long-term occupant of your house? The house, in terms of when it was set up, there was a young lady, my son, employed to, in fact, do that."
08_28_2019,housing crisis,It's an investment company's low overhead motel in a residential neighborhood. Everything the city claims it wants to avoid. It displaces long term residents and exacerbates our housing crisis.
08_28_2019,homeless,"We just can't have that kind of mess going on where parties and smoking and carousing. These communities are already disrupted enough with the many changes, homeless and so on, etc., So I'm saying to you all, divorce yourself from the concept of racism in this matter and look at the merits. Look at what people are saying."
