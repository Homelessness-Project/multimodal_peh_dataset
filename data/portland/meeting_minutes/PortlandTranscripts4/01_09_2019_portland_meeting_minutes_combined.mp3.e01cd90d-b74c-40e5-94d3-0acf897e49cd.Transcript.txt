 Item 14, request of Dee White to address council regarding lead in our drinking water, cryptosporidium, and the public trust. Good morning. Good morning. My name is Dee White. I am grateful to be among this amazing group of folks here this morning for communications, Star, Mimi, Stephen, and Charles. Thank you all for your tireless, unpaid work on behalf of Portland's most vulnerable communities.
 For far too long, I've come before you to protest your misguided drinking water policy. Beginning in 2013, our former water commissioner perpetuated a culture of mismanagement at the Water Bureau that has not protected public health.
 Water Bureau directors have not done their job delivering safe drinking water to many of their 1 million customers in the region. Here are some facts. There is no safe level of lead. It's a potent neurotoxin that is especially harmful to pregnant women, newborns, and young children. You cannot see, taste, or smell lead in water. Here are more facts. Here are some facts.
 The more corrosive the source water, the more lead leaches into drinking water. Portland officials have long known bull run water is corrosive, and further, that inadequate treatment would cause higher levels of lead in our drinking water. The result? Portland continues to have the highest levels of lead among all large cities in the U.S., not just western cities. We're still number one.
 You haven't followed the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act for 27 years, and you insist our water is safe to drink despite the threat of this profound neurotoxin. At the same time, the near zero potential of cryptosporidium sickness from bull run water has been escalated to such a serious health threat that a half billion dollar filtration treatment plant is still being sold to an unwitting public.
 Last year, former Commissioner Saltzman opined that shutting off water due to unpaid water bills is a form of child abuse. Let me add this. Isn't it child abuse to improperly treat these children's water? You could immediately protect the vulnerable with free filters, but instead you downplay the threat and blame customer plumbing. As elected officials...
 What you continue to do today is reward engineering and construction corporations and your own financial interests over the public health and the common good. And this, Mayor and Commissioners, is a betrayal of the public trust at its essence.
 Thank you. Next individual, please. Mayor. Commissioner Fritz. Just for those who may be watching and have heard this for the first time, I want to reiterate previous facts that have been stated. Bull run water, the pH is 7, which is neutral, which is un-corrosive. Unfortunately, that means that's it.
 needs to be made more alkaline in order to reduce the amount of lead leaching from fixtures that are in people's houses. If you're at all, and that's what we're doing, the council has approved a treatment plant to do that, which will be online by 2022. It can't be built any quicker, so that is what's happening right now, and was started under Commissioner Fisher's leadership.
 If you're at all concerned about whether you have lead in your water, please call 823-4000, 503-823-4000, which is the city-county information line, and ask to be referred to get a free lead testing kit that you can do in your own home, mail in, and we will send the results to you. So again, thank you very much, and I appreciate the advocacy. I wanted to make sure that everybody understands that our water is safe to drink.
 Next individual, please. Item 15, request of Star Stauffer to address council regarding hold city officials responsible for tolerating Nazism in Portland. Next individual, please. Item 16, request of Stephen Entwistle Sr. to address council regarding privatized sheltering issues. Morning. Good morning, council. Good morning. The water we cannot trust here in Portland. Put that off!
 Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Mr. Walsh, please. No. Somebody is testifying. No. No. Excuse me. Excuse me. You're going to have to leave. If you interrupt communications, you're going to have to leave. Mr. Davis, please. Please turn the lights off, Mr. Davis. Okay. I'm sorry. We're going to take a recess. You do not get to plow. Let me know, Sue, when you're ready. I'll say it. Very good. We're back in session. I apologize for the delay. Mr. Ambrose, please.
 Yes, for the delay, like I said, I don't mind Joe Walsh interrupting me. That's okay. He can do that any time. But that's me. Another thing is the reason for this delay, apparently there is a filming from the public filming, and apparently public filming is not allowed by the G4S security group here.
 I think it should be, because otherwise you wouldn't have had the delay. So anyway, that being said. Just to be clear, filming is allowed? People regularly film, including the individual who left? Then what was his problem? His problem was he was disruptive in the chamber and he was yelling, and he was being disruptive and he would not stop when asked.
 What started his yelling and why did he yell? He was using the bright lights which shines in my face and I get migraines. So the security guard was trying to block the... So you're the one that complained about it? I have complained, yes, in the past. I can't work when I've got bright lights in my face. Is anybody else complaining, do you know, about it? I've complained about it. I don't want a bright light shining in my face when I'm sitting up here. Okay, so it's just you three that complain. I complained about the interruption, that's correct. Okay.
 So you're the reason why G4S goes after him and we have to delay the meeting because you complain about the light. No, he's the reason because this has happened over and over again. Well, he has his right. He has rights to speak. He's supposed to turn the light off. It's very simple. He does not have a right to be disruptive to the council. You heard the rules. Yeah, well, if you're antagonizing him to be disruptive. By the rules of the chamber, then you can talk to someone else. Yeah, but look at where it started from, though. Okay, G4S harassed him, so he got loud. Okay.
 And you complain because you guys don't like the light, the three of you. Excuse me, I get sick. Is it okay for somebody to give me a migraine? What about these lights and those lights? What about the camera, channel 8, channel 6? I think you're being selective. I don't believe you. So anyway, nobody else complains to you guys. That's funny. So that could be all prevented. Thank you.
 We do have a water problem here in Portland, and we need a treatment, a water treatment facility for our building, okay? And for all the other low-income buildings, okay? Either that or you supply water for them, and don't make them drink it. Because when you're poor and you can't afford to buy bottled water, which I know all of you drink, okay? Yeah. It's wrong, okay? It's wrong. So...
 That amongst other issues. The Fairfield Apartments, right now the elevator is broken. We have people in wheelchairs that can't get up and down right now as we speak. You can check on that. You can call the Fairfield Apartments right now. And they're stuck in their building. They're stuck in their room. They can't move. There's nowhere to go. They can't get a wheelchair downstairs. Okay. That's just one of the issues right now. Just one. I think I'm going to leave it at that. Thank you.
 Next in. Request of Mimi Gurman to address council regarding privatized shelter as prison. Item 17. Before I begin, my name is Mimi Gurman. This is a friend of mine who lives outside in St. John's, and he had asked to come to see what happens here in city council. I came today to ask...
 Why this man, my friend, and so many others who are trying to survive outside on the streets are not worthy of your respect, your compassion, and most of all, and at the very least, temporary shelter, complete with tents that don't leak, platforms off the ground to put them on, toilets, trash cans, a kitchen, showers, and the support teams to come provide services for the people who live in them.
 Can you tell me why you find this man and our other friends who are living outside so unworthy of this kind of respect and dignity? Where is the compassion from the city council? What did my friend do and others who are living outside do so that you should treat them with such disregard and inhumanity?
 Why does my friend and so many others in the same circumstance deserve to be swept up like garbage by your contractors instead of being provided with, at the very least, temporary shelters like those I described above? Temporary shelters like Village of Hope before you tore it down. Temporary shelters in which folks outside can stay safe until some kind of housing opens up in some far-off future. Our friend, Jason, died on the streets in St. John's just a few months ago. He knew that living on the streets would kill him, and it did. He died.
 All he wanted was a temporary village to live in. He wanted to know why he wasn't good enough to have one. That's what he asked me in the parking lot at Safeway. Why do they think I'm not good enough to have a safe space like a village to live in until I can find housing? He wanted me to get that for him. He died without shelter. We loved him. He had no hope when he died. That hope was taken away from him by the council. My friend wants to be housed. Most people outside want to be housed. He's a good man.
 My friend knows that a village would be better than nothing, but he can't seem to get that because you won't allow it. But you will allow sweeps to occur. Today, today, there is a sweep in St. John's. When I bring my friend home, there will be a sweep occurring in St. John's. I don't know what's going to be left when we get there, but I will make sure that he and everyone else who I know who has become my family outside has what they need to survive another night.
 My friend has saved the lives of at least five people in St. John's from overdosing relatively recently. But you can't find the respect or compassion to allow a village to be set up for him. Each one of you voted to take down Village of Hope except for Joanne. And I'm pretty sure that Joanne's vote would not have been to take down Village of Hope. Today as we sit here trying to change your minds on giving us the right to build a village, my friends are getting swept.
 My friends aren't trash. They are good people. They have their reasons for being outside, none of which is just a choice. We need a village in St. John's. I know how to set that up. We would like to set that up. We would like to set it up and have you allow us to set that up since no other hope and provisions are being provided, especially in St. John's. Thank you.
 Thank you. Could I ask you one question? Yes. Have you had an opportunity yet to share your concept with the Joint Office of Public Services, Mark Gilliman?
 I have not, but Mark Jolin is fully aware of what happened with Village of Hope. Could you send me the proposal? I would be happy to send you the proposal. My issue in sending you the proposal is one, and that is that each time I attempt to move forward with something like this,
 I hear with the graciousness of maybe a member of the council like you right now, please send us that. Let's get together. I've also heard this in the county. And then nothing happens from that. And in the meantime, every single hour that goes by on this clock, on any clock. I hear what you're saying, but I don't know what you're talking about. So can you say that again?
 send me the document. I will send that to you. I'll send it to you today. I would be happy to do that. Thank you, Mayor. I was in St. John's last month and heard from that the joint office is setting up a village like you talk about in St. John's. They're working on it.
 May I respond to that? That village is not for people who live in St. John's. That village is Hazelnut Grove moving to St. John's. Amanda, they are two different things. There is a village being created in St. John's for Hazelnut Grove, which is already a village. The people who live in St. John's do not have a village, and it won't be for them. It will not be for them. It is allocated for Hazelnut Grove.
 Commissioner Harsky. Thank you. Thank you, Mimi. My question is, you talked about switch-hacking in St. John's today. Can you tell me... Is there a notice that was put up? I'm glad you asked. Last week, I've learned a lot in the last month because I'm now more involved with helping friends in St. John's. What I learned...
 ever since a couple city councils ago, was that the new response is that a notice will be posted in a certain amount of time before any houseless camp is swept away.
 Before Christmas, there was supposed to be a sweep the day before Christmas in St. John's. There was a notice for that. That was the last time there was a notice. We called Rapid Response. We spoke to Lance and said, don't you dare sweep people the day before Christmas. And his response was, oh, do they need more time? That was his response. And we said, yeah, like never would be that kind of – anyway, no.
 And Rapid Response is the private company that comes and...
 There were no notices put up, but the word from Lance was New Year's Day was going to be a sweep. Everybody in St. John's was ready for a sweep. There was a lot of agitation. There was a lot of, you know, what's going to happen today? What do we want to do? No notices were posted for that sweep. I made it known that no notices were posted, meaning that would be an illegal sweep. I guess people heard there was no sweep.
 Yesterday, it was yesterday when somebody came around or yesterday? Somebody came around from rapid response and said, tomorrow, today, there will be a sweep. No notices were posted. What Lance told me was every single sweep has to not only have a notice, but that he knows that his people, when they put the notices up, also take a photo and file the photo of the notices put up in case those notices are put down. I asked him to see those notices.
 I want to see that that actually occurred. We know in St. John's. I am out with my friends three times a day. I look for these notices. There was no notice. So Mimi, I would be happy to work with the mayor's office. And so if you would make sure that you make a copy of your material, share it with me, share it with the mayor's office.
 Clearly, we have some time, certain things this morning, but I certainly want to help make sure that we're not brutalizing people with so little in our community. Thank you, Joanne. Thank you very much. And I'm, by the way, Commissioner Hardesty. Thank you, Commissioner Hardesty. You're very welcome. Have a great day. Next individual, please. Item 18, request of Charles Bridgecrane Johnson to address counsel regarding privatized shelter as prison and slumlord profit crime center. Morning.
 Good morning. Thank you for getting me on there. It's number 18. I think while we're talking about numbers, we'll look ahead on the consent agenda to number 22, which I didn't pull. But I think that given some of the work that many people across the country are doing on the part of the Green New Deal, that it's unfortunate that our agenda is so busy that we didn't have more time this week to make comments
 the crisis of climate change and the horrible future we're building for our children, an actual agenda item for discussion. But hopefully by the 20th of April, we'll have that discussed very well. You may have, with the interruptions, you may have still noticed that items 16, 17, and 18 all talk about the unpleasant conditions that many low-income renters are forced into
 um recently a very large complex that isn't only low-income renters the wimbledon over in southeast has been protested there have been numerous protests against income property management and unfortunately there's not much end in sight for this because uh with the reshuffling of the bureaus uh president ewe daily is no longer positioned to uh
 do the best job she can working forward to for our city to have a responsible program for finding, uh, slumlords. Let's, you know, importantly, we always like to couch things positively. So let's say landlords facing challenges while they stack up cash. Um, one of those landlords has $3 million in the check that was mailed to them from either y'all or the Portland development commission, cause we're buying the West wind apartments, uh,
 the mayor knows I have some strategic things, but I hope that very soon we'll start to hear, now that that money has been dispersed, we'll start to hear how the Westwood location is going to build to maximum height about matching the Gladys McCoy Center so that way more than 70 people who need supportive housing can be there. On the 9th of January, two years ago,
 The Oregonian did a Facebook post. And what that Facebook post really did is it implicates you and especially the prior city council that was presiding in the death of Karen Lee Batts. We killed her. The judge that oversaw her eviction killed her. She was identified afterwards and before as a woman having schizophrenia. The Oregonian...
 Earlier this week, I thought I identified a dead person as having bipolar disorder, but now it turns out they're identifying them as having schizophrenia. And we should have a moment to recognize that our city killed Andre Gladen. Andre Cantrell Gladen is dead, shot by police, who couldn't find a better way to respond to his erratic behavior. And we know that some human beings can do better. Why can't our Portland police? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, John.
 Sue, have any items other than item 23 been pulled from the agenda? I'm referring item 23 back to my office, but have any other items been pulled? Item 26 has been pulled by Chris Trable. He has a comment he wants to make on it. Very good. Please call the roll on the remainder. Fritz. Aye. Fish. Aye. Hardesty. Aye. Udaly. Aye. Aye.
 Wheeler. All right. Consent agenda is adopted. First time certain item number 19, please. Number 19, proclaim January 7th through 14th to be Slavic and Eastern European Heritage Week. Commissioner Fish. Thank you, Mayor and colleagues. Today we're proud to acknowledge and celebrate Slavic and Eastern European Heritage Week.
 I'd like to begin by thanking Irene Konev for helping to organize this proclamation and the proceedings, excuse me, and the preceding events. And I also want to acknowledge Asena Lawrence in my office who's been working on it. Colleagues, there will be Slavic treats and tea in the atrium right after the proclamation, which will be lasting until about 1230. And tomorrow there will be a cultural celebration and dinner at ERCO from 6 until 8 p.m.
 After the speakers have concluded their remarks this morning, and Irene, why don't we bring our honor guests forward. Mayor Wheeler will read a proclamation and then we'll take a group photo. It's now my honor to introduce our panelists who are here to speak more about our local Slavic and Eastern European community. First is Slavica Jovanovic, who is a part member of the Slovak Association.
 excuse me, the Slavic Empowerment Team, Dr. William Comer of the PSU Russian Flagship Program, Pastor Maxim Grishakovich, excuse my pronunciation, and Andre Nagorne, who is an ERCO program coordinator. Who's going to kick things off?
 Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Commissioners, the Mayor, and good morning, citizens. Good morning. My name is Slavica Jovanovic, but I like to say my name is too much long, so Slava is just fine. I am one of the members of the Slavic Empowerment Team, or SET. The Slavic Empowerment Team was established on April 26, 2016, under the diverse and empowered employees of Portland Umbrella.
 The Slavic Empowerment Team supports the City of Portland diversity efforts by providing Slavic affiliated employees with the opportunity to promote Slavic cultural awareness, empower each other, share expertise and support professional development.
 Slavic Empowerment Team members actively engage with community members of Slavic Eastern European heritage to naturally bridge the gap between the city, governmental agencies, and the community. This active engagement provides for a more robust element of diversity within the workforce. For example, the set...
 can facilitate applying for new positions, finding volunteer opportunities with the city, and providing information on city projects, programs, and community grants.
 In addition to our regular workload as city employees, all of us help the community with interpretation services in several languages, including Russian, Ukrainian, Serbo-Croatian, and other Slavic languages. This effort served to make the city a more diverse and responsive place of business, as well as to establish trust with the city residents.
 And I would like to share just a little bit about myself or my story.
 As a refugee leaving former Yugoslavia during the Balkan War, after staying for several months at the Red Cross shelter in Vienna, Austria, the United Nations and community agencies sponsored our relocation to the United States. My family arrived with a young toddler and a couple of bags. I like to say a bag of diapers and toys and a bag of books. That toddler is now a medical school student.
 Learning the language, raising my child, and finding a job was a priority for me. Leaving a teaching position in Europe with a basic knowledge of English, I found a job at a local preschool center. After a couple of years of teaching, interaction with beautiful young minds, their parents and colleagues, I was able to co-establish a new program with Oregon Public Broadcasting and its educational media department, Focusing on the Learning of English.
 on statewide sessions, media literacy, impact on screen media technologies on children, brain development, development of anger management skills, and literacy in general.
 With the OPB program ending in 2008, I started working for Poland Police Bureau as a victim services specialist and one of co-founders of victim services. The newly established law enforcement embedded program within sex crimes unit was developed as a means to respond to the needs of sexual assault survivors who were reporting sexual assault crimes.
 The program has been a crucial part of providing evidence-based, trauma-informed direct services to survivors. It is intense but rewarding work to have an opportunity to guide individuals through the criminal justice system and the healing process at the same time. This might be my way to pay it forward and more. Thank you all.
 Thank you. Good morning, Commissioners. My name is William Comer, and it's an honor for me to be here today as the City of Portland celebrates Slavic and East European Heritage Week.
 I'm a professor of Russian language and culture at Portland State University. I moved to Portland five years ago when I was given the chance to direct PSU's Russian flagship program, a great educational experience that offers undergraduate students in any major the opportunity to achieve professional fluency in Russian.
 I've dedicated my professional life to studying the languages, peoples, and cultures of Central and Eastern Europe. Everything that I've learned in my teaching, research, and experiences traveling abroad have given me a deep appreciation of the challenging and complex historical situations faced by the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe.
 In the 20th century alone, these communities have lived through persecutions, ethnic cleansing, revolutions, two world wars, a Cold War, and post-Cold War economic upheaval. That past can teach us important lessons about making the world better in the 21st century. Today we celebrate the rich contribution that people of Slavic and East European heritage make to Portland and the Pacific Northwest.
 people whose roots go back to Central Europe, have long been a part of our region. And today, Russian is the third most widely spoken language in Oregon. The children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren of people who emigrated from Eastern Europe to our region carry family, regional, and national traditions that add to the cultural diversity of our state. I'm struck by the backgrounds and talents of the people I meet in this region.
 In December, at a Russian club function, I conversed in Russian and Polish with a PSU graduate student who comes from Vilnius, Lithuania, and who is studying Spanish literature and hopes to teach that one day. Globalization is really here. Thank you.
 Our city and region are much richer for the cultural institutions and opportunities that such a large population of people of Slavic and East European heritage bring to our area. From their impact on Portland's famous food culture, to the annual Polish festival, to the dual language immersion program in Russian in Portland public schools, to the Scarlet Scales Theater Group that...
 performs plays in Russian at the Oregon Latvian Community Center. All of Portland is enriched by community members of Slavic and East European heritage. I'm proud to call them my colleagues, friends, and neighbors. Thank you for your attention. And now I need to run to go teach one of those Russian courses at 1015 in Lincoln Hall. Thank you for your attention. Thank you. Appreciate it very much. Good morning, the mayor and the commissioners. My name is Andrei Nagornik.
 I've been here in the country for about three years. It's an honor to be here and speak with you. Imagine you go to another country where you don't have the language, you don't have the culture. You just get off the bus or off the plane and you realize that it's a completely different culture, it's a completely different style, everything is so different than you used to be.
 You don't know, you don't speak the language. You try to figure something out, but it takes you so much time and so much effort just to get from point A to point B.
 And then you realize that there is a lot more going on. You have to take care of your family. You have to take care of other errands and other important things. I think this is how our Slavic community came some time ago. We came from a completely different country. We came from a completely different governmental structure and style.
 And we tried to group together and group by churches, group by regions to figure something out here. And at this time, as I've been here three years, I've heard tremendous support and I thank you very much for making this and creating these bridges for the Slavic community. Because I know that we come from another country and we come from another European
 Slavic countries. We still want to be here productive. We want to know that we can help this society. We can help this city. We don't want to just go and do and create our small things and businesses and go to our small churches. We want to make sure that this city prospers. This city also benefited by our work that we are here.
 This recognition and this proclamation really shows that support. And as we came here, we were blessed with an opportunity to just go through agencies like IRCO and other to get these first services that we can get.
 I'd really like to see more support and I'd like to encourage you that we have so many Slavic people that are just in the city of Portland.
 And with your help and with our staff and efforts, we can make this city great again. We can bring so many changes to the city. And I know that we will be both successful. Thank you. Thank you. Good morning. Good morning, dear Mayor, commissioners, guests, comrades. I am happy to be here to...
 be one of the representatives of the community. My name is Max Grishkovich. I'm 46 years old. My amazing wife is also here. She follows me everywhere I go because she would like to be part of whatever our family is involved in.
 Born and raised in Moscow, in Russia, came here about 23 years ago. Prior to arriving to the United States, I finished medical school in Moscow. I followed my father's footsteps, but not only in the medical field.
 My father was president of Christian Medical Association of Soviet Union and later Russia. And from the very beginning, he taught me to be involved in a public service or people service as much as I can in my life. Thank you.
 After finishing a medical degree here in the United States and receiving license in 2001, I became one of the first Russian-speaking doctors in Portland community. And that was a challenge by itself. I maybe will mention this a little bit later. But along when I was practicing medicine at Adventist Hospital, I had a chance to have a free appointment.
 medical clinic and for probably five or six years. And I was awarded Gladys McCoy Award of Volunteer of the Year by Multnomah County at some point for this work.
 Later, God called me on a different path. Even though I remained a doctor and I still have active medical practice and two clinics that I own and practice in, God made me serve in a Russian church or Slavic church. And I'm senior pastor. For the last eight years, I'm senior pastor of First Slavic Baptist Church.
 It's currently located in Oregon City, but initially it was one of the first Russian churches in Portland.
 By being involved in all this work with people, you know, medically, spiritually, and socially, I happen to be aware of multiple problems that that community is faced on a daily basis. And after a period of time, I was invited to become part of the Slavic Advisory Council. You're probably aware of that police force initiative. Thank you.
 For the last five years, I'm taking part in meetings and initiatives of that organization, and I would like to...
 all the work and effort that these people provide to merge Slavic community into American way of living. As one of the efforts that our church provided over the last several years was we started a program that's called Recovery Network. It was specifically aimed at Russian or Slavic-speaking people
 youth that is heavily involved in drugs and crime. And so this initiative led to an organization of this group of people that allow, that are the first point of contact for those that need help.
 And then from that point on, we help these kids to get or into recovery program or into some other, to receive some other help with addiction. We just recently opened a safe house. It's located in Vancouver, but it's for the whole area. It's the transitional place for those that need to get some safety time until they can become self-sufficient.
 Over the last eight years, I organized a
 doctor's hour on Russian radio and for two hours people have an access to call the doctor directly in the broadcast and ask their medical questions and receive the answers. There are multiple things that can be done for the community that's become, became, it already became a big part of the Portland and Portland metro area and
 I think there are many people that are willing to serve, many people that are willing to work and put their free time into this. And I think with some help and with some support and maybe some encouragement, I think there are a lot of things that can be accomplished. And we're very grateful to be part of this beautiful place. We are Portlanders and we'll remain that way. And we love this city, this place. And thank you for all the effort that city provides. Thank you.
 Thank you. Thank you very much. That concludes our formal program, Mayor, and now we switch to you and a proclamation. Very good. Well, first of all, thank you all for being here. That was very impressive testimony, and I'm sure everybody in the community appreciated hearing it. So thank you for your great efforts. This is a proclamation on behalf of the entire City Council.
 Whereas Slavic and Eastern European Americans are one of Portland's largest immigrant and refugee communities, with over 150,000 people in the greater Portland area, and whereas Slavic and Eastern European Portlanders can trace their ancestry to 15 countries in the former Soviet Union and 14 other European countries with unique languages, dialects, cultures, and histories.
 And whereas, the City of Portland has many Slavic and Eastern European employees and a Slavic empowerment team that works to build a more inclusive and diverse workforce. And whereas, the Slavic empowerment team shares culture and art with city employees through celebrations, displays, performances. And whereas, Portland is a welcoming, inclusive, and sanctuary city that celebrates its growing diversity.
 And whereas the city of Portland is very proud of its relationship with all members of the Slavic and Eastern European community and will continue supporting their professional and economic advancement.
 Now, therefore, I, Ted Wheeler, Mayor of the City of Portland, Oregon, the City of Roses, do hereby proclaim January 7th to January 14th, 2019 to be Slavic and Eastern European Heritage Week in Portland and encourage all residents to observe this week. Thank you.
 Very good. If we could just come down front here, we can get a photograph. And thank you so much for coming in today. We appreciate it. Commissioner Fritz likes to say now for something completely different. Item number 20, please.
 Item 20, create a local improvement district to construct street, sidewalk, and stormwater improvements and construct a mass storm traffic signal at the Northeast 42nd Avenue and Columbia Boulevard intersection in the Northeast 46th Avenue and Saratoga Court local improvement district. Commissioner Udaly. Thank you, Mayor.
 This project is made possible by a partnership between the City, TriMet, Cully neighborhood, the Columbia Corridor Association, the Portland Freight Committee, and property owners participating in the LID, which stands for Local Improvement District. This project will reduce the backlog of unpaved streets in Cully while also supporting the creation of hundreds of jobs at TriMet's new Columbia Bus Garage.
 It will reduce both the citywide backlog of unpaved streets and of paved streets without curbs. TriMet has been increasing bus service faster than the rate of population growth. Since the last bus garage was opened in 1980, the region's population has increased 75%, but thankfully TriMet has increased its service hours even more by 132%.
 To continue that positive trajectory and to provide alternatives to the regional population driving, we need a new bus garage at which to park and maintain buses at TriMet's two existing Portland bus garages, which are completely full.
 This project also supports PBOT's Vision Zero objectives, providing sidewalks and a new safe crossing along High Crash, Northeast Columbia Boulevard, which currently has no signalized pedestrian crossings for a 26-block stretch, including the Northeast 42nd and Columbia intersection, which will be signalized. There were also some interesting discoveries made about the electrical infrastructure in the area, so we'll be discussing that as well.
 And after the staff presentation, I have three amendments to introduce. You should all have a copy of those in front of you at this point. I'd like to introduce Andrew Abbey from PBOT and Sheila Holden from Pacific Power to present on the ordinance. Welcome, and please state your name for the record. Good morning. I'm Andrew Abbey, Local Improvement District Administrator. Sheila Holden, Regional Business Manager, Pacific Power.
 Thank you. Council members, it's a pleasure to be here with you this morning. And Commissioner Hardesty, it's a distinct honor and privilege to have you consider this item. This presentation today is very similar to the one we did in November, but wanted to rerun it for your benefit. And once we get done with the presentation, then I can walk you through the amendments.
 All right. So this is a map of the local improvement district area. So this area is in the Cully neighborhood. This LID, rather, is in the Cully neighborhood, and it's north of Columbia Boulevard. The map on the left has changed slightly.
 from November 7th when you approved the resolution. We have subsequently continued our outreach with property owners in the area, and we came up with an alignment for a new east-west street between northeast 46th and 47th Avenues that has a green boundary shown around it there on the map on your left. We have shifted that to the north, which is more amenable to the property owners from whom we will be acquiring property rights.
 Just to recap the project scope, which has not changed since November, we're improving an unpaved street, NE 46th Avenue, north of Columbia Boulevard. We're constructing a new east-west street that was formerly referenced as NE Saratoga Court, and I'll be walking you through that amendment, but we now would like to call the street NE Bryant Street.
 We're going to signalize the Northeast 42nd and Columbia Boulevard intersection. So as Commissioner Udaly pointed out, we currently have a
 21 block gap on Northeast Columbia Boulevard between 21st and 47th avenues where there's no signalized crossing for pedestrians. We want to add street lighting, relocate bus stops, create a new stormwater outfall to Columbia Slough, and want to partner with the Bureau of Environmental Services on managing stormwater in the area. As you may recall for our returning council members from last year, this is the largest local improvement district in the city's history outside the central city.
 The amount of the LID is about $11.6 million, and I'm pleased to report that we received no remonstrances against LID formation. And my New Year's resolution is to try to use a little bit more plain English, and I'm not sure that everybody knows what a waiver of remonstrance is. So the translation of that is,
 Nobody submitted a formal objection to the local improvement district in writing to the city auditor. So we not only have the largest LID in the city's history outside the central city, we also have no opposition to the project. TriMet has very generously stepped up on the local improvement district. They're going to pay $9 million of the $11.6 million, and they are funding elements of the project that are not required as conditions of development.
 So this is the picture that I showed the previous council back in November. This is what Northeast 46th Avenue looks like north of Columbia Boulevard. I've been receiving complaints about this street for 13 years. This is the north end of the street just before it gets to the Columbia Flue. And this is a picture of Northeast 46th Avenue approaching Columbia Boulevard. It's not a particularly safe left turn movement onto Columbia Boulevard. The site distances are poor. Okay.
 So that's why we want to build that new east-west street connecting 46th and 47th Avenues. This is the Northeast 42nd and Columbia Boulevard intersection. There's currently not a signal there. We're going to build one as part of this local improvement district. You can also see that alligator pavement there. We are going to reconstruct that portion of Northeast 42nd Avenue in concrete because we will be having hundreds of TriMet buses going up and down this street once TriMet builds their new bus base.
 And this is an example of a concrete street that we built quite a few years ago on North Marine Drive. We built it in 1992, 22 years later. The pavement was in perfect condition with a 100 score after trucks going up and down it. So we're very pleased to build sustainable infrastructure that reduces our long-term maintenance costs.
 This project is located in the Cully neighborhood, which is our most diverse neighborhood in the city of Portland, but unfortunately has considerably more infrastructure deficiencies than the city as a whole, so we're very pleased to be able to bring this project back to you for final approval. As Commissioner Udaly pointed out, this project is integral to supporting TriMet's
 service expansion for the region so that we can drive less and take transit and use other modes more to get around. So TriMet over the past 38 years has increased our
 at about a third more than the rate of population growth, but they've now kind of hit a wall because there are three existing bus garages, two of which are in Portland and one of which is in Beaverton. The two bus garages in Portland are completely full and they have no more room for new buses, so that is why they're purchasing this property and this LID service.
 and we'll build their third bus base in Portland and their fourth bus base in the region as a whole. So I passed out some amendments for you and there's three amendments and I'll walk you through the first two and then we'll have Sheila help explain the third one.
 So the First Amendment just simply reflects that we had a formation hearing in December, and we had a crowded agenda in December, so we extended the remonstrance deadline and did not receive any remonstrances. We just want to note that in the record, that the deadline was extended. So that's the first of three amendments.
 I'm going to skip over to the Third Amendment. So as I mentioned, we're shifting that new East West Street to the north, which aligns more with Northeast Bryant Street to the west than it does Northeast Saratoga Street.
 So I was advised by the guru who assigned new street names that it would be more appropriately called Bryant instead of Saratoga. So we are proposing to rename the LID to Northeast 46 and Bryant so that it aligns with the future street name to be assigned to the street. And then the third and the final amendment, there's always a new wrinkle on LIDs. They're huge.
 something comes up that you didn't anticipate. One of the things that I learned on this LID is something that we take for granted is that when we flip a light switch that the lights will come on. But what I came to find out is we don't have enough electrical power in this area to serve various expansions planned for the area.
 So we would just like to have the ability granted by council that if a property owner voluntarily wants to fund more new electrical infrastructure in the public right-of-way,
 that they can use the LID as a financing mechanism for that. It would be strictly voluntary only if the property owner stepped forward and wants to do that. We just think it makes a lot of sense that if we're going to build new streets in this area, if we can also accommodate the new electrical infrastructure to do that at the same time. Sheila, do you want to add to that before Council entertains a motion to vote on the amendments? I'd just like to say that over the years it's been a pleasure to work with Andrew on LEDs.
 Excuse me. Stop me. Oh, my goodness. I apologize. It's okay. But I thought I had to stop. You're not the first person to have this happen. Don't feel bad. Or the last. No, this is not. You have T-Mobile, right? You can tell by the sound, right? I apologize for that. But what I was going to say is that we are doing,
 Definitely been successful in partnering with Andrew over the years. And a prime example is what we had happen in the William Vancouver Corridor. We were able to deal with the issues, the density and the right-of-way. We were able to deal with the fact that we had a number of small businesses that were located in the
 corridor who wanted to make sure that they had an opportunity to take advantage of the LID if they wanted to go underground in the area as well. And we were able to work through that with the existing larger developers and the small businesses so they would be able to have an opportunity. And that was one of the first times that we saw the financing tool being brought forth for businesses in that area.
 Pacific Power is going to be doing major capacity enhancements to our infrastructure to accommodate the new bus garage, of course, and other businesses that we anticipate will be coming into the area with the improvements. And so this is a great opportunity for us. We appreciate the opportunity to participate.
 potentially be able to finance through, but we're looking more at this as also an opportunity to partner. Not that we'll necessarily take advantage of the financing, but we'll be able to partner going and putting together our plans for where we will actually place our new infrastructure. So I hope that the City Council will support this, and I'd like to say in closing, welcome aboard.
 Commissioner Hardesty, I look forward to working with you. Commissioner Fritz. Thank you. I have a question about the electricity. Is it the property owner's responsibility to upgrade their electricity, or is it Pacific Powers? It's a combination. Okay.
 In this particular case, it's going to be, some of it will be with the property owner, the customer, and some of it will be as we're doing it for the general area for us as well. So it's both. In another area that's not a local improvement district, if a neighborhood wants a street light, who is responsible for putting it in? Well, the city of Portland...
 own street lights in our service area. And so though we would assist and provide the power for it, the city of Portland through the Transportation Department would be responsible for the installation of the street light. Thank you. And the maintenance of the street lights.
 Appreciate the explanation. I'd just like to add that I just learned about this amendment on Monday, and I'm very pleased with it. It seems like an opportunity for us to collaborate, save time, money, resources, and disruption to the area, which is great. But yesterday I got an update on the electric vehicle rebate program coming through the state, and in particular a rebate program for low-income families.
 households and it got me thinking that we should be considering infrastructure for charging stations for electric vehicles as these opportunities arise. So not going to amend the amendment or suggest that we add that here but we
 But going forward, I'd like to make sure that we're taking that into consideration. Thank you, Commissioner. Maybe just on a housekeeping note, I might suggest for simplicity's sake that we adopt this amendment. Maybe have a second amendment for that. We're going to have hundreds of new TriMet employees working at the bus base. And what I will...
 Certainly do amendment or no amendment is I will follow up with Chima and see, you know, a lot of those employees, the mechanics and operators get there before the buses start running. And so maybe there's a partnership opportunity here so that those Chima employees can use electric vehicles to get to work. Not directly related to this.
 But just so that you know, Commissioner, Pacific Power is, in fact, looking and working with the city of Portland around right-of-way infrastructure opportunities for electric vehicles. And we actually have identified some sites where we will be doing that. So it is something that we're actively doing right now.
 Could we put this as a package of the amendments? Can we forward them as a package? Excuse me? Yes, maybe I might suggest that we move the memo for adoption per the January 7th memo. And then maybe if we want to have a second amendment, as you might propose, Commissioner. Okay, so I've moved it. We have a second. Any further discussion on the package of amendments, call the roll. Fritz. Aye.
 Fish? Aye. Hardesty? Aye. Udaly? Aye. Wheeler? Amendments are on the table. Commissioner Udaly, were you going to make a second amendment? No. Okay. Very good. Okay.
 That's all we have today. Just on a final note, while electrical infrastructure may be relatively new to LIDs, LIDs are not. One of the earliest LIDs in the city of Portland was in 1867 when we paved what was then known as B Street, which today is known as West Burnside Street. So if we didn't have an LID, we might be grading and graveling West Burnside Street. So thankfully that's not the case. Thank you. Commissioner Hardesty. Thank you. I just have one comment.
 I have one question, and my question is, this new TriMet bus station, is it going to have electric buses? Very good question. Yes, Commissioner. We had TriMet here back in November, and it's initially going to have the diesel buses that they have today, but they are on, and I don't remember exactly what the time frame is, but they are on a time frame to eventually convert all of their bus fleet to electric.
 I hope you can put some pressure on them to expedite that timeline because we are going to be adding to the air pollution in that area if we're not very thoughtful about making sure that TriMet is not exacerbating the air quality issues in that area. Okay. Thank you, Commissioner. Very good. Public testimony.
 We've had four sign up to testify. All righty. Corky Collier, Frank Josiatis, and Maggie, please come up, and they'll be followed by Mary Seip. Very good. Name for the record, please. Three minutes. Corky Collier, Executive Director of the Columbia Corridor Association. I want to thank Sheila for reminding me to check my phone. Go ahead.
 Andrew Abbey's been working his LID magic in the Columbia Corridor once again. He brings sidewalks and bike lanes to streets that are lacking them. He pays pothole-ridden streets. He works with other bureaus to lay down sewer and water lines as well as electrical lines while we've got the street under construction. And he gets adjacent property owners to pay for almost all of it.
 LIDs are a great deal for the city, and Andrew is good for the businesses that are paying the bill. He combines sincere caring for the property owners with good accounting practices to bring projects in on time and on budget. He's creative, and he's a tightwad. This project is no exception. In our first meeting with property owners, we had no objections to it, and we had virtually no concerns other than, of course, cost.
 Under a different manager, this would have been a simple reconstruction of the intersection at 42nd. But Andrew took a look at it and said, you know, we've got a terrible road on 46th, so we talked to some of these tiny business owners on 46th to see if they'd be willing to pay for part of that rebuild. And they were. And then he looked further and he said, you know, we're going to be bringing a lot of new TriMet employees to the area. Maybe we can divert some of them across the new Bryant Street over to 47th, which is more capable of handling the load.
 And he pulled that off. He found property owners that were willing to sell their property for that right-of-way. In short, this LID, in addition to reconstructing 42nd Avenue intersection, brings this new pavement to 46th, a new connector to 47th. It's a great project. It's going to help TriMet build their bus garage, and it's welcomed by the local property owners. In particular, it's been welcomed by one property owner that's been shoveling gravel into those potholes for 50 years. Wow.
 These are expensive projects. They're very, very expensive for the property owners. But Andrew Abbey brings very good value to them. I encourage your support. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, what I want to say is the hallmarks of this project where you go in and you consult with the property owners, they are afforded –
 that homeless people are not, and that is the right to be seen as a person before the law. And when you're confronted with an engineering problem and transportation is very important and how it's all done is very important and how it affects people is very important, when you're talking about
 social services and lack of housing and things that impact the homeless, you don't consult the homeless to find out what's going on with them and where the rubber is not meeting the road or how they're affected. And Ted
 If you do not know where I was Monday the 7th and what I was doing, you won't know what I was talking about, but I went up to your office on the 8th and I left a detailed record. That was stamped by your office. If you didn't read it, you won't know what I'm talking about, but it's exactly this, where...
 Services are called, and they do nothing, absolutely nothing. Maggie, let me do this. I promise you I will read it. This is about the ELIT, and you're testifying on this. This is about having a city project and consulting property owners who you consider people before the law. And I'm talking about...
 homeless people who are affected by the services that don't exist or do
 exist on paper but don't exist in reality and just the dysfunction of that. And here you were able to work with the property owners. If you worked more with homeless people in terms of directly in conversation with them about what works and what doesn't and what's on paper that
 pretends to be there and is not there, you would have a more functional system. Like, you got this system to work because you consulted the property owners. If you don't talk directly with homeless people, you're never going to fix the homeless problem. So Maggie might be surprised to hear, and thank you for your testimony, you might be surprised to hear I agree with you
 And I do, in fact, spend a considerable amount of time meeting with, talking with, sharing, going to, and being present to understand the situation of people who are directly impacted by homelessness. So I appreciate that.
 I can, you know, if you read what I wrote to you, my written communication, you will see that services are called, you know, at the exact time and under the exact condition that are prescribed, and they do absolutely nothing. Okay. I look forward to reading it. I appreciate your input. Thank you, Maggie.
 Good morning. Good morning. My name is Frank DeZetas. I work for Mackins Opel Body. We own a piece of property just west of where the proposed TriMet bus garage is going to be. And I've been working with Andrew for probably about five months. He's an outstanding human being. I back the project 100%. And when you were talking about the electrical cars charging station,
 We'd be interested in working with Andrew on that. We're building a call center there, and we'd be willing to work with him on that because we are a Tesla-certified shop and stuff. So I just – Andrew's a great guy to work with, so I'm just backing him 100%. Great. Thank you. We appreciate your being here. Thank you for your input. Thank you, Corky. And Mary Seip. Last but not least.
 Welcome. Thank you for being here. Carrie, is this your first testimony of the new year? The first time of the new year, 2019. Welcome. And it marks almost two years that I've been coming here now. And thank you. I just want to echo...
 accolades for Andrew. I'm a big fan of his, and when he has something on the agenda, I make sure that I'm here because it's always such an incredible example of how things should work.
 the presentation is detailed but understandable. It's not a narrow scope. It goes beyond the scope, looks at all the other issues that might bubble up. And I just want to say that...
 I think one of the reasons why there isn't opposition is because they trust Andrew. And the track record stands for itself. And I just quickly want to say that I'll bet Andrew is the first person who will say, and also thanks to his staff,
 We often get an opportunity to express our appreciation to individuals that come here and do the presentations. But I'm sure that there's a wonderful, hardworking staff behind the scenes, and I just want to express my appreciation and admiration for the work that they're doing. And if you want to use a department as an example of how things should work, this is one of them.
 Mary, I have to say this. Thank you. In our day and age, I mean, as we speak, there's people outside shouting insults at all of us. Andrew is an exceptional employee, but he's not unique. There are lots and lots of really good public employees who work for the city of Portland, and they give the best years of their lives, and they are passionate, and they are focused, and they are effective.
 And unfortunately, the way the world works today is we hear a lot of the negatives and a lot of the angst and a lot of the frustration, and we don't hear...
 people coming in and saying, I really support what a public employee did for me or did for the larger community, and that you took the time to do that is something that I'm really appreciative of. So thank you for doing it. Thank you. I'm honored to have the opportunity to do it, and I'll keep coming. Great. And, Andrew, as always, thank you for making us all look good. Thank you. And that concludes public testimony. Colleagues, is there any further on this matter?
 Very good. This is a first reading of a non-emergency ordinance. It moves to second reading as amended. Thank you. Next item is item number 27, please. 27, accept bid of Bricks Paving Northwest, Inc. for the East Portland Active Transportation to Transit Project for $2,515,323. Very good. Welcome.
 Good morning. Happy New Year. I am Larry Palat from Procurement Services. Mayor Wheeler, special welcome to Commissioner Hardesty from Procurement Services. You have before you the Procurement Report recommending a contract award to Bricks Paving for the East Portland Active Transportation to Transit Project. The amount is $2,515,322.75.
 The engineer's estimate for the project was $3,076,274, and the Bureau's confidence level at that price was optimal. September 26, 2015, Council actually approved the Ordinance 187340 for Procurement Services to competitively solicit the 2018 East Portland Active Transportation to Transit Project.
 The project was advertised on the city's electronic procurement system. Bids are open November 15, 2018. Six bids are received, response to solicitation, and Bricks Paving is the lowest responsive and responsible bidder at $2,515,322.75, which actually is $560,951, or 18.23%, under the engineer's estimate.
 The big gap between 2015 when the ordinance was approved and 2018 is, and it's probably more appropriate for Commissioner Hardesty's edification, there's a big gap because ODOT develops all of the DBE requirements, and they have to approve all of the pieces and parts, and then they give us a goal for the project. So sometimes it's a matter of a few months, and sometimes it's a matter of a lot longer, right?
 The project is a federally funded highway project and as such the city's standard goal of 20% state of Oregon COVID certified firm participation is not applicable. Federal projects recognize a DBE or disadvantaged business enterprise certification only. The Oregon Department of Transportation as the grantor and manager of these federal funds
 assigns a goal to each project for DBE participation. This project had a goal of 9%, which is in line with most recent city projects. PBOT's been requesting higher goals. Three years ago, our average goal was about 2.5% participation, so they've been working hard at getting higher goals, and it's coming slowly. Thank you.
 Bricks Paving has committed to $456,170, or 18.14% DBE participation for the project. Bricks Paving is acting subprime contractors located in Tualatin, Oregon. They are not a state-certified COVID contractor. They do have a current City of Portland business tax registration account and are in full compliance with all of the city's contracting requirements.
 If the council has any questions regarding the bidding process, I can certainly answer those. Because the city's, our aspirational part and the DBE goal set by ODOT was met almost doubled, we did not ask anybody from transportation or from Bricks Paving to be present. Paul, any questions? No, I move the procurement report. Second. We have a motion from Commissioner Fish, a second from Commissioner Hardesty. Sue, please call the roll. Chris. Aye. Aye.
 Thank you for the report and the encouraging news. Aye. You daily? Thank you for the report. I'm very pleased to see that they have more than doubled the minimum DBE and will continue to strive to do better in that arena. Aye. Wheeler. Thanks, Larry. I vote aye. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Item number 28, please, Sue.
 28. Authorize limited tax revenue refunding bonds through December 31, 2021. Colleagues, the Bureau of Revenue and Financial Services continues to take an active approach in managing the city's debt portfolio. Authorizing this ordinance will provide the city with an additional strategy for refinancing its debt and increased potential to realize debt service savings. Opportunities to repurchase the city's bonds are obviously subject to market conditions.
 By having this ordinance effective for an extended period of time through 2021, the city will be ready to capitalize on such repurchase opportunities as they arise. Matt, I know that you were here previously. You've been here since December 19th. You've been very, very patient as we've had to reschedule this. So I appreciate your being here today. We'll get her passed. Thanks for your dedication and patience. Thanks.
 I'm Matt Gerak, Debt Manager in the Bureau of Revenue and Financial Services. So what I'm proposing today is to provide this. I do have a presentation, too. I'm not sure if that's going to go up. So what I'm proposing today is to provide the city's debt management division with an additional method of refinancing outstanding bonds at lower interest rates.
 The proposed legislation provides debt management with a broader ability to specifically refinance Portland's full-faith and credit bonds. By passing this ordinance, you are authorizing the issuance of refunding bonds that will fund the open market purchase of existing bonds from bondholders. There's supposed to be a – There should be some slides up there. So we have to – let's take a pause because we don't see a slide on our –
 It doesn't look like I received them. Can you just describe it for us? Yeah, I'll do my best to describe it. So bonds that are repurchased in the open market are legally extinguished. And when we use debt financing to fund that purchase, a refinancing occurs. This additional flexibility allows the city to potentially realize debt service savings from bond repurchase opportunities as they occur.
 This authority granted to debt management would expire on December 31st of 2021. So municipal bonds, like the cities, are typically issued with a prepayment provision, typically referred to as the call option. And with a call option, an issuer can refinance bonds at a predetermined call date without penalty.
 Municipal issuers historically have been able to refinance bonds prior to the call date, which is referred to as an advance refunding under the federal tax code. And an advance refunding includes some penalty and prepayment costs. And if the penalty or cost to perform an advance refunding was relatively low, issuers like the city would typically refinance before the call date to mitigate interest rate risk.
 So, in other words, the risk that savings would go away with higher future interest rates. The 2017 Federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act removed municipal bond issuers' ability to execute an advance refunding with tax-exempt refunding bonds. And since the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the city has been restricted to waiting until the call date to refund its bonds at whatever interest rate levels are at that time.
 So to go over a brief overview of what the repurchase refunding is, the city can still refund its bonds prior to the call date by an alternative approach called an open market repurchase refunding. An open market repurchase refunding can occur at any time and is not considered an advance refunding under the federal tax code. And accordingly, tax exemption can be retained in the new refunding bonds, which lowers the interest rate.
 An open market repurchase refunding can provide savings because of the difference between the market value of the refunded bonds that are being repurchased and the market value of the refunding bonds due to differences in both bonds' call dates. The viability of executing an open market repurchase refunding is dependent upon multiple factors such as overall interest rate levels, conditions of the bond markets, our ability to identify existing bondholders.
 And finally, existing bondholders' willingness to sell bonds back to the city, and most importantly, at what price. So, some final thoughts. First, bond repurchases would occur in coordination with other city bond issuance transactions. And because of that, they would occur relatively infrequently. And secondly, the city would...
 not repurchase very large relative to our total bond issuance, very large amounts of bonds. I would anticipate that a bond repurchase, if it were to occur, would be in the $1 million to $20 million range. So I'd be happy to answer any questions you may have. Colleagues, any questions? Commissioner Fish. Well, I thank you for your very thoughtful presentation. I just want to try to put this in.
 in plain English for someone who's maybe watching. And that is that you're asking for the authority...
 to prepay some of the revenue bonds that we've issued as a city in order to take advantage of market conditions, which may end up saving us interest rate and other factors. So the net benefit here is to the people we serve, the taxpayers, and the flexibility allows you just to respond to market conditions. And under federal law, if you do repurchase,
 and then issue new debt, it continues to be tax-preferred. Is that correct? That's correct. All right. Thank you. Commissioner Hardesty, you've got... Thank you. And then...
 In a desire to also try to talk in plain English, the advantage that we would have is that we could possibly build more affordable housing or use the other resources that we have. We'll have more resources that we could then invest, right? Correct. In our community. I really like plain speaking because I get it now. Thank you. Thank you.
 Commissioner Fritz. And according to the financial impact statement, we don't know whether or not we can even do, these bonds can be sold. And we certainly don't have an estimate of how much is going to be saved by this process. Correct. It depends on market conditions at that time. Do we get a report to council to tell us when you have done this? Yes.
 Yeah, so it would be in coordination with any other bond sale that we have, and we can keep you apprised of any information developments that occur as we approach the bond sale. Yeah, so this is an authorization to go ahead and plan for it, and then it comes to council for us to approve. Exactly. So, yeah, we would essentially be just a bit more nimble in our ability of what we can do when we do a different bond sale. Thank you.
 Very good. Any further discussion on this item? There being none, please call the roll. And we had two people sign up to testify. Oh, I'm sorry. I apologize. Yes, public testimony on this important issue. I apologize. Yes. Charles Johnson and Maggie. Very good. Thank you. Okay. Thank you, Maggie. All stand up. You can write me.
 Why don't you just come sit down here, and if you could just say your name for the record, that'll be fine. Thank you. Such as it is. Good morning. Good morning, Commissioner. For the record, Charles Bridgecrane Johnson. And when this was before you as the 1335 on last year's agenda, I also believe I spoke in favor of it. One thing that I think, you know, supposedly the city is always trying to set the highest bar in this area of transparency.
 I think if you would give the presenter guidance that when we talk about the debt portfolio, as was mentioned, we're talking about maybe a maximum change in about $20 million of the bond portfolio. It would better serve the citizens and I think even yourselves if the presentation had included a brief summary of the entire Portland debt portfolio. We know that the
 I think the biggest chunk of the Portland debt portfolio is right now is the critically needed $258 million authorized by taxpayers, I think almost a couple of years ago for housing. But as the people, the presenters, staff, I think Andrew works with monitoring the market, it's also just good for us as taxpayers to know how many, what bonds are out there and which ones that he thinks are most likely to be positioned for early retirement and cost savings.
 Also, because so much of the bond portfolio, quarter billion, is for housing, every time it's discussed, I think we need to be mindful of that.
 When the bonds are financing capital improvements, especially housing, have we made adequate preparations to maintain that capital? It would be very sad if we purchased $258 million worth of housing and did not have a good, solid budget process through the Housing Bureau and Home Forward to make sure those people continue to live in quality, well-maintained homes. Thanks very much. Thank you. I appreciate that.
 Good morning. Thank you. Good morning. What did you say? Happy New Year. It's good to see you around these tables. Hi. My name is Veronica Bernier. I'm an LVN, C-V-I-C-U LVN, and I belong to the CLVNA in California but also here. And my license number is K59053, and I'm public health.
 I walked out to Happy Valley over the weekend, and I saw two homes that I think you should buy. Nobody's in them. But it's at the end of a long trail and a long, long roadway at 145 in the morning. I was looking for a lost puppy. Okay.
 And it was Pastor Tom Dissert's puppy. It had gotten out of the closet and scrammed, you know, ran away. So I found these two beautiful homes, and Pastor Tom Dissert said he'd like to buy them, and if we could get it for the city, it would be cheaper. Now, if you get it for cheap, good. But in the long run, don't try to undercut your daughters by putting her in a cheap hotel. The absolute lowest hotel here is O'Connell Lodge.
 And for $50, just flat on the money, you can get it. Ned there is a wonderful guy. Unfortunately, his wife tripped and fell and sprained her ankle. But we're going to go and help her out too. This is a city of helps, like Mary's Help Hospital.
 I reminded the girl over there at Farnbuck or Hoff Floral that Michelle Clark is the daughter of Bud Clark and that whenever she hears of a problem, she sends flowers. So I think we have to have a giant floral campaign and cheer everybody up for the new year, and we're always good. When Lynn Martin was here, we had better parties. Thanks a lot for sharing. I think you're buying now. Think reality and tend to reality. Those are my relatives. Thank you.
 Thank you. I like your idea. Cheering people up is a good thing. Maybe they'll have flowers on the 17th for the Japanese New Year out at Montgomery Park. Maybe we'll see you all there. Excellent. Thank you all. Very good. Any further conversation? Please call the roll. Fritz. Aye. Fish. Aye. Hardesty. Aye. Udaly. Aye. Wheeler.
 I think this is a great idea, and I appreciate the Debt Management Division bringing this forward. It provides flexibility. It allows us to actually save taxpayer dollars by refinancing our outstanding bonds at a much lower rate. So the savings is funds that then can be used for other projects. In other words, we're –
 By taking advantage of some of the market conditions, we're able to actually spread the tax dollars that we have even further and more effectively. I vote aye. The ordinance is adopted. We have one item that was pulled from the consent agenda. I believe it was item number, was it 26? We also have a four-fifths item. Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, let's do the four-fifths. I'm sorry, I picked up my old agenda. Here's the new one. Let's go to the four-fifths, 28-1, and then we'll do the pulled item. 28-1.
 Authorize the Director of the Bureau of Transportation and the City Engineer to permit construction-related lane closures on the Southwest 5th Avenue Transit Mall auxiliary lane during the development project at Southwest Montgomery, 4th Avenue, Harrison, and 5th Avenue. Very good. Commissioner Udaly. Thank you, Mayor, and thank you, colleagues, for being so accommodating to place this item on the 4th's agenda.
 It will allow work to proceed this week instead of waiting until next week, which will save us time and money. The Office of Management and Finance staff is here to answer any questions, as they are the impetus for this temporary street closure permit. But for some background, the 4th Montgomery Project is an exciting project the city is collaborating with PSU, OHSU, and PCC on to build a new seven-story building on what was formerly called the Jasmine site.
 I really missed that bar. I had a birthday party there once. This will provide new downtown office space for the city, as well as offices and classrooms to support PSU's Graduate School of Education, PSU and OHSU Joint School of Public Health, and PCC's dental program and clinic.
 In order to execute construction as timely and efficiently as possible, the contractor is requesting to utilize the eastern lane of Southwest Fifth Avenue intermittently to allow construction equipment to enter and exit the site. Their intent is to align site access activities with surrounding traffic controls to ensure minimal disruption to traffic flow and anticipate no impacts to the MAX or bus lanes.
 Staff, if you have anything further to add, please proceed and state your name for the record. It's Sharon Raymore. I'm the project manager with OMF Facilities for this job. And I do want to echo thank you for letting this get bumped up this week. Time is of the essence, and this site is a pretty tricky one downtown as far as access and maneuverability on site. So essentially this request is to allow...
 truck rigs, drill rigs, and whatnot to back onto the site because they can't pull in, turn around, and come out nose out. So this is to allow some intermittent access for that, yeah. Mayor? Commissioner Fish. You know, when you serve on this council long enough, and I'm reminded that I was once the most junior member and now the most senior member,
 you often have the back story on certain issues that not all your colleagues have. And I would simply say that under Commissioner – excuse me, under Mayor Adams, we had a robust debate about establishing a so-called education urban renewal area. It was quite controversial. It turns out that Commissioner Fritz was sort of one of the heroes in that debate because while she was a skeptic of the education URA –
 and didn't necessarily support it. She also felt the city had made a commitment and that you could not pull the plug on that Irvin-Renaud district without supplementing our commitment elsewhere to Portland State University, which we did by expanding the North McAdam district. As a result of that, and as a result of some advocacy by people like Gretchen Kifori and Susan Emmons and others,
 We actually got a more robust investment in affordable housing in South Waterfront, which was one of the dividends. But we also made a commitment to continue to partner with Portland State University on shared use facilities. And an issue that I believe predated all of us on council was the urban center.
 which was put together by very creative people in terms of financing and had money from all kinds of different pots. But that was one of the models. The Jasmine Block –
 is honoring a commitment we made to PSU to do a development that had some of our resources and some of their resources. But I think it's worth noting that it all began with an education urban renewal district that was passed by council, then essentially repealed, and it was only because the council insisted, and Commissioner Fritz carried the swing vote, that there be an honoring of a commitment in North McAdam
 in an expanded district that we actually have the Jasmine block and the chance to do this work. So a little bit of a back story. Good context. Mayor. Good context. Commissioner Daly. I'd just like to add for the public's benefit that typically to get an item on our agenda, it has to be submitted Tuesday by noon, the week preceding the council session. The four-fifths agenda is a mechanism to get things done.
 on to the agenda on short notice that are urgent. It requires four out of five of us to agree to that and to all be present for the vote. So that is why we have this extra little item on the agenda today. Very good. Thank you for that clarification.
 Commissioner Hersey, do you have a question? I don't have a question, but I appreciate the explanation because I was pulling my hair out last evening with the additions, and so I really appreciate that explanation. Thank you. It doesn't happen very often.
 Happy to hear that. Very good. Please call the roll. Do you have to take testimony? Oh, sorry. Is there a public testimony on this item? We did have two people sign up, Charles Bridgecrain Johnson and Maggie. Very good. Okay. I can't pass because it means I get to come up here and say that I'm Charles Bridgecrain Johnson, and I get to say thank you, Madam President, because as maybe Ms. Harsin knows on some forms of the agenda, there is no 28-1 agenda.
 So this project is, when we talk about any type of construction work where the city is a participant, I do want to refresh the council about previous discussions where we've had where people experiencing disabilities have testified. And especially when we're talking, we're dealing with...
 top-tier property manager owners like the City of Portland and Portland State University. Let's hope that if I go through this, or even more importantly, if a person living with a disability goes through this neighborhood, we find that we've got top-notch notification and assistance to people experiencing disabilities when they move around construction areas, particularly inside the Central City LID. Thanks very much. Thank you. Appreciate it. Please call the roll. Fritz.
 Commissioner Fish, thank you for the historical reminder. And thank you, Commissioner, for bringing this in an expedited manner. Aye. Fish. Aye. Hardesty. Aye. New Daily. Thanks for being here on short notice. Aye. Wheeler. I'm happy to support this. Thank you. The ordinance is adopted. Thank you, guys. Sue, could you just, to make sure we clean this up legally, could you read item 23, which is being referred back to my office? Yes.
 Item 23, increased salary ranges for several Portland City labor classifications. Very good. And based, colleagues, on the conversation that we had yesterday during the work session, I think there's a different approach we can take here. So I'm referring this back to my office. And last but not least, item number 26, which was pulled. Thank you.
 Item 26, authorize a contract with the lowest responsible bidder for the North Greeley Multi-Use Path Project in an amount not to exceed $1.9 million. That's very good. And may I ask who pulled this? Mr. Cravel. You did. Very good. It's up to you then. Take it away. Great. Thank you. I won't take much of your time, and I apologize for disrupting the agenda in this way. Not at all.
 As you know, this is your name, please. Sorry. Yes, my name is Chris Trable. I am chair of the Overlook Neighborhood Association. Actually, shouldn't – I've had staff waiting here all session, so I think we – Very good. Could you hold off one second? We'll get the staff up here first. Are you here to support it or oppose it, sir? I'd like to ask for a delay in it. Okay, so let's have a staff person. Okay, we'll have the staff folks come on up. The way it works is staff comes. Absolutely. Very good. So you can return to your seat. We'll have you up right next. Okay. Thank you. I appreciate your patience. Good morning. Good morning.
 So, Mayor, since these are relatively non-controversial projects, they were on the consent agenda, and I don't have checking points prepared. So, luckily, we have PBOT staff here to explain the Greeley Avenue project. Thank you for being here. We appreciate it. Hi, I'm Nicole Pierce. I'm a capital project manager with PBOT. I'm the project manager for the North Greeley Multi-Use Path Project.
 This is my first time at council, so should I just give you a summary of the project? I'm not exactly sure what I'm supposed to. So it will be a two-way bike facility, barrier separated on the east side of North Greeley Avenue from Going Street in the north and connecting up to an existing pathway that connects over to Interstate Avenue to the east, east.
 As you know, North Greeley Avenue is a very busy, high-speed road, and so we thought separating those bikes and pedestrians from heavy truck and vehicle traffic was a good idea. The connection at the north end will be a diagonal bike signal that will lead the southbound bicyclist to the path on the other side of the road, and then, as I mentioned on the south end, it will connect up
 to an existing pathway that leads to Interstate Avenue.
 We were working within the right-of-way that we had available on North Greeley, and the width of the multi-use path will range from 11.5 to 13 feet wide, and the lane widths for the vehicles, which I believe is Mr. Treball's concern, is with the lane widths for vehicles,
 The vehicles will be the two, so there's four lanes for vehicle traffic. The two inside lanes will be 10 1⁄2 foot wide, and then the outside lanes. On the eastbound side, it'll be a 12-foot lane, and then on the westbound side, the lane will vary in width from 12 feet to 13 feet. And I'd just like to add that this particular vehicle,
 stretch is high on my priorities to correct. It's a heavily used bike path, and it's an extremely dangerous stretch of the road. Yeah, at the south end, in the southbound direction, the current bike lane has to cross the on-ramp to I-5 there, and that's a... At the bottom of the hill. Exactly. Yeah. Okay.
 Well, thank you for being here. That concludes our presentation. Very good. Public testimony. Thank you for being here. Good morning. Thank you for your patience. No worries. Again, for the record, my name is Chris Trable. I'm chair of the Overlook Neighborhood Association. As you know, this project is entirely within the Overlook neighborhood. This stretch of Greeley is something we've had our eyes on for safety concerns as well.
 Some members of the neighborhood, residents, members of the Overlook Association Board have raised concerns about the width of the roads. I'm not here to talk about that, contrary to the assumptions of staff. Generally, I've found staff to be very good to work with on this, and personally, I trust the engineers' analysis of the road. What I am here to do is request a temporary delay on this so that you might consider...
 amending the project slightly. And specifically with the relocation of Hazelnut Grove upcoming in the spring, is what we've been told, perhaps in the summer to the St. John's neighborhood as you discussed earlier, that site is at the southern end of this project. It is the bike lane that was referred to that will be connected to. That site's going to need to be cleaned up. There'll be some mitigation required there.
 And we have been in discussions as a neighborhood and with the joint office on what to do with that site after Hazenut Grove is relocated. One of the ideas being kicked around is putting in an off-road cycling track, a skills park there. We think that's a good use. Another idea is gardens. Either way, it's PBOT property. It's going to need a lot of work.
 I encourage you to consider linking that cleanup to this project. If you're going to have crews on site, you're going to have dumpsters on site, you might as well save a few dollars and coordinate all of that work at once. The times align for the relocation and this project. You can pull this and add that to the request for proposals or bids or whatever the correct term is. I apologize. In line with the idea of cycling, the north end of this project,
 project is at the going street intersection and that's where madrona park is and we know that there's a lot of interest from cyclists including with the still in development off-road cycling master plan to use part of overlook park for off-road cycling as well the area on the west side of the park is an excellent place with hills slopes it already has trails cut into it
 That also could be incorporated into this project to create a seamless connection between off-road cycling locations and the bike trails that so many people use. Ideally, I think for some of our neighbors, you guys would have worked with Union Pacific to expand the trail completely off of the right-of-way and allow for wider lanes. I recognize that that's not possible. Staff assures us that this is safe.
 Some of my residents disagree, but I'm fine with what the project as is. I just ask for you to look for the synergy of creating off-road facilities and the cleanup of the Hazelnut Grove site in this project. Thank you. Thank you. Can I just respond briefly to this idea of off-road cycling? Without belaboring the point,
 The city has made a significant commitment to off-road cycling at Gateway Green. There's currently opportunities at Forest Park. There's a master planning process going on that you've alluded to, and there's community members who would like to see some safe options opened up in Riverview Natural Area, among others.
 And typically, the Parks Bureau has been the lead agency on these projects. They are all underfunded. I just don't want to leave the impression that there's an opportunity for off-road cycling here and somehow in the next couple of years we're going to take that vision and implement it there.
 There's lots of folks that are already in the queue, and we don't have the resources to fully fund all the ones that are in the queue. And so I just – I want to offer – preach a little caution here about any delay based on the notion that we're going to find the resources to do off-road cycling at Overlook. In addition, we would have to go through a very comprehensive public planning process, and I can – and Commissioner Fritz has –
 has gone through that herself and she knows how complicated this issue is. So this is not something that's
 on the horizon. I like the fact that you're linking. You're suggesting that there's some potential linkage. But I just want to preach caution here because I don't see this getting into the queue ahead of other things for now, and I see no reason to wait to do the work to make the experience for a current cyclist safer. If I could reply to that. We're not wedded to... No, no, that was a comment from my colleague. Yeah, it's not a deliberation. I'm having a...
 Mayor, I'm going to want to invite staff back up, but it looks like Mr. Johnson would like to give testimony. Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Thanks. Charles Bridgecrane Johnson. And having had the pleasure of visiting probably the cleanest, best-maintained location of very low-income housing and secure individuals who are being gentrified, so we can possibly have off-road cycling into St. John's? I don't think so. But the main thing is that...
 The pre-existing use for this area was some form of community garden. I'm not the biggest enthusiasm of everybody that lives in the Overlook neighborhood, but any low-income people that live in the Overlook neighborhood, if they're going to get anything out of this, they should have access to an expanded community garden on these grounds that we're displacing homeless people from,
 During, well, the talk is happening now, during a month when we're going to have the place and time count, and find out that what we have failed to do is keep this homeless village situated where it should have remained and increase the number of homeless villages throughout the city so we have less tarps being blown around in windstorms like we experienced a few days ago, etc.,
 As to whether there might be offered bicycle use there or something like that and costs, I think that given the location of the facility, if we're going to have any talk about any other use other than an expanded community garden for people in the overlooked neighborhood area and anybody that wants to commute to that area along the bike path,
 you know, any funding for fancy bike uses or whatever, which should be a conversation that really comes after either Herbert Hainer or Patrick Nilsen have talked to us about how much money they're willing to name this path the Adidas Way. If they don't want to spend money to name it the Adidas Way, then it's just going to be a multi-use path that helps people get to community gardens. I think that if you're thinking about recalling staff for further testimony,
 it may turn out that there's already synchronicity between when this work would actually take place. We're just now authorizing the work today, so by the time we find the lowest bidder and engage in the work, it may be in direct synchronicity with the unfortunate removal of the good tenants at Hazelnut Grove. Thank you. Thank you. Staff, if you could come back up, please. I just have a couple questions for you. First of all, it's my understanding that this project is –
 been delayed? Can you tell me how long we've been waiting to move forward on this? I think we originally told the public that we would be building this facility in 2017. It kind of bubbled to the top as a kind of opportunity to piggyback on a paving project that rose to the level of maintenance paving.
 Since then, the project has grown beyond the scope that can be done by our maintenance crews, so we decided to contract it out. So it got rescheduled for last summer, 2018, and it got delayed because of design issues and the timing of bidding it. If we thought about pushing to get it out last summer, but we would have had to bid it later,
 kind of in late spring and we didn't think we'd get favorable bid prices. And then with the paving window ending with the rain, we just didn't think it was feasible. So unfortunately it slipped another year and, yeah,
 The bike community certainly is expecting it to be delivered this summer, summer 2019. I know you said this was your first time at council, so I'm not sure if you've been overseeing this project the entire two years since I've only had the bureau for a few months. But do you know what level of public engagement was done? No.
 Yeah, we've been to the Overlook Neighborhood Association. That was back in April. And they had some concerns, and I had my...
 A lot of them were traffic engineer type concerns, and I responded with an email back then. But otherwise, there hasn't been a lot of public engagement done. When I first inherited the project, I did reach out to Hazelnut Grove, but then when I realized they were moving, I didn't pursue that. But we had been thinking about making sure they could still get to the dumpster for Hazelnut Grove and logistical things like that. But it's...
 It's not a project that has a lot of alternatives. You know, when I inherited it, the decision had been made that the path would be on the east side and be barrier-separated. So...
 And I'd like to add to that, if I may. This has been in the works since before I was on the council. Oh, okay. And in the heavy vehicle use tax, the heavy vehicle use tax work group selected this as a project for funding in October of 2016. And the council allocated an additional $650,000 of general fund to do this project. Thank you. So there's been a lot of involvement before your tenure in the project. It's great.
 It's really just chuntering along to the contract stage at this point. Yeah, and so that leads me to my next question. What we're doing here today with this ordinance is authorizing a contract with the lowest responsible bidder, which means we have to put it out for bid. So can you give us an estimate on roughly how long that bidding process will take and when we anticipate starting actually...
 shovel on the ground? Yeah. Well, I'm hoping to get it out to bid in mid-March, and then it would be a three-week advertisement. We would open the bids in early April, award the contract in May. And so, you know, groundbreaking probably wouldn't happen until July. Okay. So, yeah.
 I am going to encourage the Bureau to try to coordinate on the move of Hazelnut Grove to minimize disruption to the neighborhood. But if it gets held up, we're not delaying this any longer. It needs to happen. It's a serious safety concern. So that's my direction to the Bureau. I appreciate that. Thank you, Commissioner Udali.
 Very good. Thank you. Thank you for your testimony. Thank you. Any further discussion on this item? Sue, please call the roll. Fritz. Well, thank you to staff for your presentation for the public testimony. Thank you to Yesenia Carrillo and my staff who looked into this item for me. I'm really excited about it. The North Portland Greenway has been in planning for more than a decade, and this project is a key safety feature. We're getting gestures from the city attorney. So...
 The version of the ordinance that I have in my packet has a title that says in an amount not to exceed $1.5 million, but I'm seeing in the public impact statement, or I'm seeing on the council agenda 1.9, and at least as I add the numbers together, it's 1.9. Could I just make sure that everybody else's ordinance has the right amount in the title? I apologize. The ordinance. I've got 1.5. You have 1.5.
 Yes, you're right. The ordinance says 1.5, but then the impact statement says 1.9. Does staff come back up? The title in the agenda says 1.9. I can see there was a clerk edit to match the title to the impact statement. Okay. So which is it? Is it 1.9 or 1.5 after the edit? 1.9. Okay.
 All right. So do we need to move an amendment to the title? Let's move an amendment to the title just to be clear. I move an amendment to the title. We have a motion from Commissioner Udaly, a second from Commissioner Hardesty. Please call the roll on the amendment. And this is to amend the amount to be 1.9, which is the correct amount, and not to exceed amounts anyway, so hopefully it will come in at 1.5. Fish. Aye. Hardesty. Aye. Udaly. Thanks for catching that. Aye. Wheeler. The amendment's adopted. To the main motion, please call the roll.
 I will get back into the swing of my speech. Thank you to Yesenia Curio and my staff and to all the community advocates who've been advocating for the North Portland Greenway Trail for many, many years. And it has been challenging, the inability to work with Union Pacific rather than working with Union Pacific. That's something that each of us runs into at one time or another and it's just the way it is.
 I am very happy that the heavy vehicle use taxes, which Commissioner Novick passed in 2016, along with the gas tax.
 are being used for this project, $650,000, which was allocated by the working group. The council set aside an additional $650,000 of general fund money because of the supreme importance of this project. And we also got $600,000 from House Bill 2017, the transportation bill at the state, to do this. So it has been a great collaboration. Thank you for staff.
 Moving it forward. Thank you, Commissioner Udaly, for taking it on. Aye. Fish. Aye. Hardesty. Udaly. So just a few points about this project. North Greeley Avenue is a busy, high-speed road with heavy freight vehicle traffic and bike lanes. This project will protect cyclists and pedestrians behind a continuous concrete barrier connecting North Portland neighborhoods and businesses with the Rose Quarter.
 This project is funded, as Commissioner Fritz mentioned, with a combination of funds from the heavy vehicle use tax and a city council set-aside and House Bill 2017 funds. This ordinance will authorize PBOT to bid and award the contract to construct the project we hope to begin in July. I also want to point out that we had...
 another bicycle infrastructure item on the consent agenda that wasn't pulled. That is what staff refer to as the Hop Greenway in northeast Portland, which is an exciting project to create a low-impact greenway parallel to the high-traffic northeast Haldy and Gleason corridors.
 Both of these projects will be constructed either this spring or summer, and I'm confident we'll encourage more safe and active transportation options in these neighborhoods. I vote aye. Wheeler. Thank you, everybody who worked on this. Thank you, city staff. Thank you, Commissioner Udaly, and thank you.
 to my two senior colleagues who obviously have seen this before and worked on it. Glad to see it coming to fruition. I vote aye. The ordinance is adopted. We are adjourned. Thanks. All right. Good afternoon, everybody. This is the Wednesday, January 9th, 2019 afternoon session of the Portland City Council. Sue, hello. Could you please call the roll?
 Fritz. Here. Fish. Here. Hardesty. Here. Udaly. Here. Wheeler. Here. Good afternoon. Welcome to the Portland City Council. The City Council represents all Portlanders and meets to do the city's business. The presiding officer preserves order and decorum during the City Council meetings so everyone can feel welcome, comfortable, respected, and safe.
 To participate in council meetings, you may sign up in advance with the council clerk's office for communications to briefly speak about any subject. You may also sign up for public testimony on resolutions or the first readings of ordinances. Your testimony should address the matter being considered at the time. When testifying, please state your name for the record. Your address is not necessary. Please disclose if you are a lobbyist. If you are representing an organization, please identify it.
 The presiding officer determines the length of testimony. Individuals generally have three minutes to testify unless otherwise stated. When you have 30 seconds left, a yellow light goes on. When your time is done, a red light goes on.
 If you are in the audience and would like to show your support for something that is said, please feel free to do a thumbs up. If you want to express that you do not support something, please feel free to do a thumbs down. Disruptive conduct, such as shouting or interrupting testimony or counsel deliberations, will not be allowed.
 If there are disruptions, a warning will be given that further disruption may result in the person being ejected for the remainder of the meeting. After being ejected, a person who fails to leave the meeting is subject to arrest for trespass. Thank you for helping your fellow Portlanders feel welcome, comfortable, respected, and safe. Very good. Well, that pretty much wraps up our business for today. Thank you all for coming.
 We only have one item this afternoon. Sue, could you please read item number 29? 29, adopt area parking permit surcharge allocation guidelines. Commissioner Udaly. Okay.
 Thank you, Mayor. Before we begin, I want to introduce a substitute, Exhibit A, that clarifies the makeup of the Stakeholder Advisory Committee, as well as further clarifies that the priority for the spending of these dollars will be focused on our city's equity goals and strategies. Commissioner Udaly moves the substitute amendment. Commissioner Fish seconds the substitute. Any discussion? Please call the roll.
 Commissioner Udaly and Matt Graham, I really appreciate your work on this, and I especially appreciate the amendments. Aye. Fish? Aye. Hardesty? Aye. Udaly? Aye. Wheeler? Aye. Substitute amendments are on the table. Okay. So, as we all know, parking has been difficult in northwest Portland for a long time. I know this personally. I lived there from 1987 to 2006.
 But PBOT has been working hard with Northwest residents and business owners to make finding parking easier. In December 2016, council passed an ordinance allowing the Northwest Parking District to pilot the use of new tools to manage their on-street parking.
 In the past two years, PBOT has used some innovative management tools in Northwest to encourage more people to park off-street, take transit, or bike town to work. This all helps manage the demand for on-street parking. On-street parking utilization data is used to make recommendations on changes to manage the on-street parking.
 It's exciting to see our city not only using data to make smarter decisions and to help improve quality of life, but it's great to see us getting more creative introducing new tools such as the transportation wallet. Ideally, other neighborhoods with parking issues could use the tools that Northwest has had access to, and we should take what we've learned from Northwest and be able to apply that to other neighborhoods so that they can manage their parking more efficiently.
 We are going to hear an update on the Northwest parking permit pilot today and hear what they have learned. In addition to the Northwest report, we will be voting on an ordinance that provides guidelines for use of the permit surcharge. These guidelines have been modeled on how Northwest District used their surcharge funds. Permit surcharge...
 Funds have two primary goals. Manage parking demand using price and raise funds for transportation demand management strategies and programs in the district and capital projects. The parking districts that have permit surcharge added to their permit cost have provisions that eliminate the surcharge for low-income residents.
 All programs and projects funded by surcharge funds will be evaluated against the citywide equity goals and strategies with the goal to alleviate transportation burdens on low-income, underserved communities and communities of color. Staff has a presentation, and then we will have invited testimony. Can I have staff come up to the table, please? Welcome, and please state your names for the record. Chris Arms, PBOT.
 Owen Ron Kelly with Rick Williams Consulting. Great. Thanks for being here.
 So, again, I am Owen Ron Kelly. I'm with Rick Williams Consulting. We're a local parking and transportation firm here in Portland. And we've been working with PBOT on the parking management pilot since its inception. We have a couple of things to discuss with you today. One is the update of the management pilot and the ordinance on the parking permit surcharge guidelines that Chris will be talking about. Okay.
 As you've already stated previously, parking in Northwest has been historically challenging with many different users competing to park on-street. Many historic buildings that are still there today were built before cars became commonplace, and today parking challenges have been compounded with the growth of housing and employment, many vying for the same on-street resource.
 Since we started implementation of the plan in 2015, more than 1,000 new residential units have been built and 1,000 more are in the pipeline. Couple that with the growth of jobs, new storefronts, restaurants, the parking demand will only continue to increase. With only 5,300 on-street spaces in Northwest, one space for every three households, there's vital need for focused and innovative parking management.
 After a multi-year planning process with intense public and community involvement, after the planning process, the Northwest Parking Management Plan was adopted in 2012.
 The Northwest Parking Stakeholder Advisory Committee was formed in 2014 to guide the implementation of the plan. The parking permit program was initiated in 2015. Meters followed, installed in 2016. Shortly thereafter, new tools were requested to better manage parking more efficiently, which launched the Northwest Pilot. The following year, 2017, the Permit Pilot began. Thank you.
 The SAC advises the city on transportation and parking issues in Northwest. They also provide input on identifying district transportation needs and priorities to support more efficient transportation access. They meet monthly in an open forum and more frequently when reviewing survey results and prioritizing management strategies. Members are appointed by Commissioner in Charge of Transportation, and the Charter states that the SAC should have 13 members.
 four representatives from the Northwest District Association, four representatives from the Northwest Knob Hill Business Association, and five at-large members. Additional outreach includes open houses, residential and employer surveys, and even door-to-door outreach. The cornerstone of good parking management is regular and consistent data collection and evaluation.
 We actively manage on-street parking each year using industry best practices to ensure the system is operating efficiently as possible. The parking study is conducted annually in Northwest to guide informed parking management decisions using good data. PBOT staff has worked with consultants and share recommendations with Northwest SAC for deliberation and implementation.
 In 2016, PBOT asked City Council for parking requirements tied to new development as a way to mitigate unmet parking demand related to growth. City Council did not approve that and directed PBOT to try different strategies instead. The Northwest Parking Management Pilot Ordinance passed in December of 2016, authorizing the use of new management tools like limiting the number of permits and using price to regulate demand.
 With new tools in place, SAC recommended placing a surcharge on area permits in the 2017-18 year. The SAC recommended adding a surcharge of $120 with waivers for low-income residents to the cost of a Zone M permit, raising the annual cost to $180. The surcharge on permit funds...
 and were to serve transportation programs and projects that encourage mode shift and to also reduce parking demand in the district. We are the only city in the United States that uses these tools to manage parking demand this way so far. In the first year of the pilot, we changed the permit program by limiting the number of permits based on building size and opening date.
 We also limited the number of employee permits and eliminated annual guest passes or guest permits. Permit surcharges helped to limit the number of permits sold, and the revenue raise went towards programs that introduced people to new transportation options, such as the transportation wallet. This slide demonstrates some of the immediate changes following the introduction of the pilot and the resulting recommendations. A net reduction of 1,600 permits.
 The reduction in full-time equivalent ratio to 80% and added the surcharge helping reduce 700 business permits. And again, the elimination of the guest permits. Though there was a small increase in the number of residential permits. Commissioner Hardesty has a question. Sure. Excuse me. I hate to interrupt your flow, but would you go back to the last slide that you had? The 700 business permit decrease happened.
 Does that mean that 700 businesses are no longer doing business in northwest Portland? No, these are employee permits. These are permits for employees. Individual vehicles? It's for a pass rather than yes. So it's assigned to...
 Well, businesses purchase permits for their employees, and they're transferable from employee to employee. Okay. So that's what we're encouraging people to do is to share permits, and we limited the number of permits issued to .8 per FTE. That was how we received the reduction of 700. Before, it was one permit per employee. You could buy as many permits as you wanted. Okay. Okay.
 It's not a reduction on the number of businesses that have access to permits. Or the number of employees necessarily. It's just the ratio. We put a restriction on the ratio of what you could purchase. Right. Thank you. That's helpful. Where do you get the data in terms of number of employees? The employer provides it. They give us a roster of their employees and number of hours that they typically work, and we total that up, divide it by 40, and receive the number of permits. Is that reliable information? Yes. Okay.
 We believe that we're trusting them to provide good information. And this being Portland, of course, is trustworthy. Absolutely. Very good. That's right. All right. Got it.
 In year one, the year one results, in addition to the permit side, parking occupancies were lower in each hour of the survey after implementing the meters and the new permit program, roughly a 4.5% decrease. Peak hour decreased from 86% to 82%, and these are what we would consider very positive strides. Okay.
 Each year, changes are made based on parking study data and employing industry best practices. Here are some of the recommendations made after the year one study. Expanding coverage of the meters in the Northwest Parking District, redistribution of the number of 30-minute stalls and a reduction of a few of them, converting one-hour to two-hour stalls, amongst others.
 Can you explain to me the – and I'm sorry I don't know the answer to this, but I really don't. The 30-minute stalls, I'm assuming, are commercially oriented. Is that a fair statement? Yes.
 In this case, it depends on the district. In this case, it serves both residents and commercial purposes. So the intent was to provide 30-minute spaces for quick trips in and out of businesses, but also for residents if they're bringing lots of groceries home, they can use those 30-minute spaces. So there's a rationalization of the 30-minute spaces to the types of businesses that you're talking about?
 in that particular area is that correct yeah to the businesses um and then also um in the residential district we tried to locate one per block face so residents in that area would have a place to pick up and drop off whatever it is and then go out and search for a parking space that makes sense i just wanted to make sure that's what it was thank you good
 The parking permit surcharge revenue supported the transportation wallet, as we had stated. It's a suite of passes and memberships for people who use active transportation. The 2018 wallet included a free annual bike town membership, one annual Portland streetcar pass, and $100 in TriMet HopCard value. The transportation wallet was offered free for all residence employees who gave up their parking permit.
 It was also available to any other Zone M employee or resident for $99. In addition to the parking studies, we surveyed businesses, residents, and visitors regularly. From a survey of people with the transportation wallet, we learned that the wallet was successful in helping people take transit and bike town more often.
 While encouraging people to drive less helps the city reach the overall transportation and climate goals, it is not yet clear if the transportation wallet will help reduce any parking demand. Many people report needing or wanting a car for work, family errands, or to get out of town on the weekends. There is an opportunity to do more outreach and encouragement for car-sharing services to help those that don't need a car to further reduce parking demand in Northwest.
 We're using the survey data to improve the transportation wallet. The next version of the wallet will include more TriMet value and credits to Car2Go to help people with car sharing services. Can you tell me how many wallets were actually issued? I'm assuming initially it's a small number. Is that accurate? I think it was – so to date in Northwest, I believe it's over 1,000 wallets.
 That's actually more than I would have thought. In Northwestern. That's the combined of people opting out and purchasing. Well, that's fantastic. Very good. And it sounds like you're also trying to increase the incentives then. Yes. Great. All right.
 And how does that fit with the reduction? And so is it a direct one-on-one? The wallet is helping people use more public transit or other modes of transportation? Yes. So if you are eligible for a permit or a business is eligible for, say, ten permits, and they opt out of five of them, they would get five wallets and could purchase five permits. And then they can distribute them.
 the elements in the wallet amongst their employees, whatever fits their needs the most. That's a nice incentive.
 What we learned from this effort was in year one, the permit pilot, the approach to managing parking and permit, we had to modify it. So extensive discussions with the SAC using data and recommendations from the consultants, lessons learned from other cities and listening to residents and community members helped inform the recommended changes to further manage parking demand.
 The continued high parking occupancy coupled with the interest of neighborhoods and the parking SAC to encourage new building tenants and owners to use off-street parking spurred the parking SAC and PBOT staff to find additional approaches to manage parking demand. And that's what we're looking at now, next steps. Next.
 parking management requires constant monitoring and in Northwest we will continue to collect data on parking utilization and survey residents, businesses and visitors on how to manage parking better using quality data. While we don't want to sugar coat this, getting to this point has been a heavy lift with lots of meetings and open houses.
 PBOT staff continually check in with people as changes are made and get back to them in order to inform the program and process through surveys, open houses, meetings with partners, and other SAC meetings. Here's a few of the quotes that we heard from our last permit and wallet holder survey. And they're not there. Okay.
 Okay. So, you know, I guess what I would say is that, of course, it's not all rosy, right? So there was a few complaints and critiques, but overwhelmingly, I think the response has been very positive about the proactive approach about how we address parking management in Northwest. Okay.
 And, you know, that was a big takeaway, I think, from this. I think the wallet was very innovative, certainly, and we hope to expand its use and coverage as we go forward. So Chris is going to. Next. Going. Right there. Okay, so I'm going to talk about the permit surcharge. So currently Northwest and Central Eastside are the only parking districts that are allowed to have a permit surcharge.
 In January of 2018, Council directed PBOT to initiate two additional parking management pilot areas. And at that time, so in February, PBOT asked for letters of interest from areas who wanted to participate in the pilots, and we received nine letters of interest.
 PBOT then collected occupancy data in April and May to evaluate the parking issues in each of these areas. And North Mississippi and Southeast Hawthorne had the highest occupancy, and PBOT contacted these areas and held informational open houses.
 And then in June and July, ballots were sent out to evaluate support for the pilots, and unfortunately neither of the ballots passed. So at that point, staff met with representatives from both neighborhood areas, Mississippi and Hawthorne, for feedback on the process and what could be changed and what we could do moving forward. The Boise neighborhood has asked PBOT to undertake a full process
 parking management plan for the neighborhood. And Hawthorne representatives said that they would like to wait and not enter into a pilot program at this time. And so now we're initiated a conversation with the community around Southeast Division. So we're working with them on a pilot moving forward. But before we start working with the community on new pilots, guidelines are needed to outline appropriate use of funds if an area elects to add a surcharge to the permit fee.
 Surcharge is added to the base cost of an area permit with the purpose of using price as a tool to manage parking and to fund transportation man management programs that are for the district they are collected in. The purpose of the guidelines is to produce clarity on appropriate use of funds. Based on these guidelines, funds will be focused on transportation man management programs and projects.
 Examples include the transportation wallet, free transit passes to low-income residents and employees, car share membership, bike town, and added bike parking. All programs and projects funded by the permit surcharge will be evaluated against the citywide equity goals and strategies with the goal of alleviating transportation burden on low-income and underserved communities.
 Based on council input from the parking management manual this summer, members of the advisory committee will follow the same composition as what is outlined in the manual, and that is what's reflected in the amendment to exhibit A. So that will be business owners, residents, and employees who may not live within the district. And all members will be identified with input from PIVOT Equity and Inclusion Manager and the Public Outreach Coordinator. Thank you.
 We would like to be able to take what we have learned in Northwest in the Central Eastside and apply this to other areas of the city. It is important for any new parking districts to understand appropriate use of surcharge funds so they can evaluate the benefits to their community before assessing a surcharge. We would like council to support these guidelines currently being used in Northwest District for any new parking districts that may be formed. So if we have any questions.
 Commissioner Fritz. Thank you for your presentation and for making the amendments. How are low-income residents exempted? What are the criteria for being exempted from the surcharge? In Northwest, it is a self-certification program, so the guidelines are connected to HUD, and I think we have that directly. It's the next slide, I believe.
 I'm sorry, is there more presentation? No, we have a slide that shows the low income limits right now that are used in Northwest, and it is self-certification process. So these are the guidelines for what is identified as low income and what is used in Northwest currently. It's a self-certification process, and at that point you do not pay the surcharge. And is that decided by the committee, or is that a standard? That was identified in Northwest by the committee. The Central Eastside has a slightly different
 and it is more aligned with the TriMet program. So each district could be different on that? It could be different, yes. And that's determined by the advisory committee? That is, they advise the city on how that is determined. So it is not solely up to their discretion. Got it. And so just so I'm understanding this, you gave us a good report on the Northwest District and some of the changes that have happened there.
 this item, this ordinance is using that information and kind of making it citywide. Am I understanding that correctly? Yes. The guidelines that are developed are based, they're modeled after Northwest and what we have learned and how we would like the surcharge funds to be used to make a direct impact on that community. And then you alluded to changing the hours of operation in Northwest.
 Is that separate or is that part of this? That's separate. Initially, we had thought that that would come forward, that there's more conversation that's happening. And so that is not part of what we're asking you to vote on at this time. And that did come to – that will come to us, right? Yes, it will. Okay. And then my final question is about establishing new permit districts. Yes. There was a lot of discussion about the Lloyd area and the convention center and the motor center. Yes.
 what's the process for that kind of a program? For permits? Yes, expanding it and having like an event surcharge like in Northwest. So at this point, because they are a fully metered district and not a permit area, the event district would be somewhat similar to what would be happening right now in Northwest.
 Providence Park is the name of it now. Providence Park. And so the meter rate would change based on the event. The area right adjacent to it in Elliott is looking at potentially having a permit –
 but there would not be permits allowed in the Meandert area. Okay. And that would come to Council to approve a permit area in Elliott? No, that does not. It doesn't have to? If they are following the current APP, the Area Parking Permit process,
 then that is allowed in code. If they want something different, then that would come to council. Okay. And then event pricing for around the motor center, does that come to council? That was outlined in the parking manual this summer. So the parameters of that, we would be working with the community in that area, and we'd be following the guidelines that are in the manual that was adopted. So you just get to do it? Based on the data, yes. Yes. I mean, not just randomly. Great. Thank you very much.
 Commissioner Hardesty. Thank you very much. I absolutely believe this is the right direction for us to be headed. I guess my concern is what are the safeguards on how the money is spent? Because as I see it, you're supposed to prioritize equity goals and strategies, but I don't see anything in what you're presenting that talks about how you get to those equity goals and the strategies around that.
 So each advisory committee would make recommendations, and they would come to PBOT, and we would work with our equity and inclusion manager to evaluate those based on the citywide goals and strategies and the PBOT-specific strategies. Did that—
 answer your question? Not really. Let me try again. As a community member, so I live in a community that has like really like no sidewalks and really bad infrastructure and so if you were selling this permit project in East Portland where I live,
 I think people would be prioritizing safe travel to school. I think people would be prioritizing how do I get to a grocery store in a food desert area. And so the equity goals in my neighborhood would be different than, say, the equity goals in Lloyd Center. And so how would that process work? So what we –
 anticipate and what has happened in the previously just in Central Eastside and Northwest where we have these surcharge is we have an advisory committee and then we have we collect information from the public via meetings and surveys and we look at projects that are identified transportation projects that have been identified as a need through the transportation system plan and what is in the list of neighborhood specific projects
 and then we go out and gather input from the community on what is a priority for them. My last question has to do with the low-income exemption. So the $6.25 per month permit for low-income families, does that follow the MFI as well? No.
 So is that set based on the median family income? Yes. So this is what is specific to Northwest at this point. Okay. So it is something different. The threshold is different in the Central Eastside. That is following more of the TriMet low-income fair program, where if you have an award letter from HUD or SNAP or the income threshold is different.
 There, so we're following it. I would just caution you because TriMet's low-income fair program is extremely new, so we don't know who's being left out of that program, so I hope you wouldn't only focus on what TriMet is doing, but that we're truly looking to make it equitable for very low-income people and we're not pricing them out of their community. Absolutely. Thank you. Commissioner Fish. I think you had in an earlier slide –
 recommendation that the SAC in Northwest is going to take up to push the time to 8 o'clock and that's that's not that's not an issue before us correct but that's that's what what a what the what the stakeholder advisory committee may be contemplating in terms of pushing so I think we're all used to reading meters
 I actually find the meters in northwest Portland the hardest to read of all. If it's at 5 or 6 o'clock, it's impossible to read the way the new ones are structured. But I get that for most of us it's a 7 or 8 o'clock limit. Why around the convention center is it a 10 o'clock limit? The events. Yes.
 The events that are specific. That's why it stops at, I believe it's 6th Avenue. So anywhere from 6th Avenue to the west is specific to events in the convention center and the moda center and the Coliseum. Regardless of what the event is? Correct. But we have the technological capacity to tailor that, don't we? Yes, we do. It's very difficult, but yes. Well, I raised this with Commissioner Daly earlier. I found it.
 ironic, anomalous, I don't know what the right word is, that on New Year's Eve, when 5,000 people celebrating sobriety were doing a powwow at the convention center. Excuse me, Commissioner, your mic isn't on. When people were taking, you know, 5,000 people were off the streets, not drinking at one of our most dangerous evenings at the convention center, we were charging full freight until 10 o'clock.
 Pow Wow went to midnight, but still for families, many of them low-income families, they were coming to that event, say coming at 5 to hit the prime events. They were being charged for five hours. Right.
 to be there, I would think that we'd want to find a way to incentivize people on New Year's Eve to stay off the streets and be at a sobriety powwow, given all the other negative things that happen on our streets. But technologically, we do have the capacity to tailor that at least for specific events. Yes. Okay. Thank you. Very good. Does that complete your presentation? It does. All right. Thank you. That was very helpful. Public testimony, Sue? Yes.
 We have one testifier, Tony Jordan, or there are other testifiers. Okay. Oh. There's invited testimony. Okay. We'll do the invited testimony first then, Commissioner Udaly. If you were invited, come on up. Everybody will get a chance, I promise. Welcome. Please state your name for the records. Hi. I'm Juliana Lukasik. Hi.
 And go ahead. Yeah, go ahead. Okay, great. Thank you. So I am Juliana Lukasik, and many of you know me through my association and work with the Central East Side Industrial Council. But today I'm here to express my personal opinions as a small business owner and property owner in the Central East Side.
 The Central East Side is an example of the broader use of a permit surcharge. We have utilized it to help us form an ESD, and we have also used it to clean up and promote safety on our right-of-ways. A large percentage is dedicated to transportation demand management projects, for which we have statistics that indicate we have been highly successful in efforts to help employees and visitors use alternative transportation options.
 We are especially interested in expanding transit options with these resources. One of the things we're very proud of is that, and I don't have the numbers, of course, but we also have been using the transportation wallet with great success because the Central East Side is a particularly difficult district for parking. And the more permits we can reduce, the better for us. So we've been really successful in that use of the surcharge.
 The permit surcharge in the Central East Side would be a part of the
 proposed ESD city match, which also includes 51 percent of net meter revenue. We will be asking you to approve the implementation of our ESD later this month, which will be an excellent example of a program that creates a partnership between businesses and the City of Portland. Ms. Lucasa, could you say that again? Because the question I was going to ask you is, what is the relationship between the surcharge program and the ESD application that we have coming up, I think, next week? So –
 Are they separate and distinct programs, or if they overlap, how do they overlap? We were the original – we're the reason that the permit surcharge exists, and we sort of have used it in ways that others not necessarily have used it. We are currently using the permit surcharge to help us in the –
 massive undertaking of outreach to implement an ESD. How that is used in other districts is sort of the question of the day. And we believe that it could be used to help...
 districts form an ESD potentially, but there should also be... I'm sorry, an enhanced services district? Yeah, sorry about that. So they are separate, and a formation of an ESD is a one-time event. And so all of the funds from the permit surcharge are really more... We are more interested in using those funds for transportation demand management and transit. Thank you. So...
 So basically, the permit surcharge in the Central East Side would be a part of the proposed ESD match, which I mentioned also includes 50% of net meter revenue. So in our case in the Central East Side, we started with the parking permit surcharge as we collected data to –
 to demonstrate the need for meters. And as meters come into the district, we have a 51% of net meter revenue. So eventually the parking permits should disappear and the meters should actually become a greater presence in our district. The ESD, the Enhanced Service District, will be an excellent example of a program that creates a partnership between the businesses and the city of Portland.
 It is important to note that the Central Eastside Industrial District and those supporting the formation of the ESD are predominantly small business owners like me. So I wanted to note that in the Central Eastside, the mass majority of the property owners and businesses are all businesses that are under 20 employees. So that's an important distinction. That's unlike any of the other business districts, and it's something that I'm particularly proud of being a part of that community.
 The Central Eastside is a successful example of how a diverse district that includes mostly small businesses and residential can work together to promote programs that work for everyone. And the permit surcharge has been a big part of that success.
 While the Central Eastside Industrial Council utilized our permit surcharge to form an ESD, I strongly encourage you all to direct an effort to establish a comprehensive program for a neighborhood or a district to establish an ESD. Permit surcharges could be a funding source, but we need alternative sources for smaller districts who may not have been...
 who may not have a substantial enough permit surcharge or no surcharge at all to utilize it for ESD formation, which, again, I feel strongly is the goal of that is to help people have transportation demand management options. And that, I think, is an excellent use of the permit surcharge. I am very pleased to have partnered with the dedicated staff of PBOT over the years. And I, as a private citizen, ask that you approve their guidelines for future APPs.
 I'm a little confused, though, because the...
 Enhanced Service District does more than transportation management. Yes, it does. So it doesn't seem to me that this is an allowable use of surcharge management. So the ESD is the private funding side of a relationship with the city, much like the Lloyd District. We have a partnership with the city. The transportation side of it is the permit surcharge would be used for the transportation demand management. The private...
 money raised through an ESD, which is separate from, so they are two separate entities, would be used for other things like safety and cleanup and security. Okay. Thank you. Good afternoon. I also wanted to assure you, I'm sorry, I also wanted to assure you, Mayor Wheeler, that as a business owner who has used permits, I am a very reliable source for FTE information.
 All right. We know one person. I can vouch for many businesses. I can vouch for many businesses. Is that because the form says under penalty of perjury? Exactly. We do not want to have to answer to Chris Arms. Well, plus you're all watching what each other are doing. So if one business has magically a permit.
 permit per employee. Exactly. I mean, it really does self, you know, thank you, self-police because it's like, the parking is so hard in our district and so if we saw some other business having a whole bunch of permits we would question that. Well, you know me. I can't help myself on that. Thank you. I appreciate it. I appreciate you daily. I'd just like to clarify something. In the ordinance, we create a definition and list of
 that clearly focuses these funds on transportation-related items, not livability. So I'm afraid we've gotten a little off track.
 And I want to focus on the matter at hand today. I apologize for that. I did want to make the distinction that there are two. There are the private side and then there is the transportation side. And those definitely are two different things. And you did that at the end. I appreciate that. But there's been a flurry of what's. Yes, I know. What is she talking about in the room? So I needed to clarify that. Thank you for the clarification. You bet. Thank you.
 Good afternoon. I'm Rick Michelson. I'm the chair of the Northwest Portland stack and I've been working on parking issues for over 40 years in Northwest Portland now. You still haven't found a parking spot. I own a number of parking spots, in fact. We won't get into that. As you know, Northwest Portland has grown quickly with increasing jobs, increasing housing units, but it remains a really diverse community.
 The two main census tracts in northwest Portland are actually low enough income that they would qualify for the Opportunity Zone program. So we're dealing with equity and dealing with trying to make sure that people are dealt with fairly throughout the district, which also means it's very hard to charge people a lot of money for permits when they need their cars to go to work, which is why we institute the low-income thing.
 We started out selling 10,000 parking permits the first year for 5,000 parking spaces. That was kind of out of whack. With a combination of the surcharge and putting some limits on spaces, on the number of permits that a business could have, for instance, that number has been reduced to around 7,000 permits sold. Our consultants tell us that we need to get that down to about 5,900, which is going to be really tough. We've done the easy stuff so far.
 By putting the permit surcharge in businesses that were just buying a permit for every employee, even though those employees only work two days a week, are now sharing those permits. Residents who had permits for five cars initially because they were so inexpensive have cut that down to one or two cars. So we've made those kinds of changes.
 But getting people to give up their cars because of the price of permits would make it inordinately expensive for many of our residents. We estimate that the market value of a parking space on street is probably $60 to $80 a month. But to charge anything near that would mean that people who need their cars to work would not be able to live in our neighborhood anymore. Another interesting thing about this is it really doesn't matter how many permits are out there.
 It's how many permits are being used at any given time. For instance, we have around 3,000 employee permits, but our most recent survey, only about 800 of them were being used on a given day. So to get down to the number being used is not really that important. Similarly, the residential permits, the best thing that could happen to Northwest Portland is if all the residents drove to work every day and freed up those spaces.
 but that is so contrary to our livability goals and everything that that's not a direction we're moving in what we're trying to do through the tdm programs and through the the surcharges really incentivize people to look at alternatives um to keeping a car in the neighborhood um owning a car is very convenient and i think most people will continue to own cars
 if they can afford to, so we're looking at better ways of managing it. One of the things we learned recently is that in addition to the 6,000 on-street spaces in northwest Portland, there are 12,000 off-street spaces. So one of our next focuses is going to be focusing more on shared parking, making sure those spaces are used to the extent possible and are not sitting there empty while those spaces on the street are there. Thank you.
 We probably need control or access to about another 700 parking spaces in Northwest to get the system in balance. And one way, obviously, would be to build them, but we're not proposing that. The other way is to make sure that the spaces that are off-street are used more efficiently by more people. So in that way, we increase the availability of parking without increasing the number of parking spaces. As Owen said, this is a work in progress. Things will change every year for the next few years.
 But we think we've gotten a handle on the data and gotten a handle on what's going on so that we can begin to move forward. You raised some questions about the changes in hours for enforcement. And while that's not directly before us today, I thought I'd make two comments. One is we want to start enforcing later in the morning because the spaces on 21st and 23rd Avenue don't fill up until 11 o'clock tomorrow.
 And if we didn't start enforcing until 10 o'clock, a resident who couldn't find a space anyplace but on 21st or 23rd would not have to get up so early to move their car out of there before they started getting tickets. The evening recommendation of extending it is our consultants feel strongly that –
 Meters are one of the ways to control usage. And if the usage is too high, we should do things like increasing the cost of the meter or increasing the enforcement availability. We have two peak hours of parking demand in northwest Portland. One is from 11 to 12, which is well covered by the enforcement and the meters now. But the other is between 7 and 9 p.m., which is not enforced at this point anymore.
 So that's why we're looking at extending those hours to age to pick up some enforcement there. It hasn't been discussed by the SAC yet, so we don't know whether that's going to be a real recommendation or not. So is the concern a business concern or a residential concern or both? Both.
 At that time, the biggest concern is residents who come home from work and can't find a place to park because other people are there. We don't know who those other people are there at that time, and that's one of the things we need to find out. You know, if it's turning out that those spaces that are being used by people that should be there, customers or others, we don't want to chase them away. Right. That's what I was thinking. Rick, you know, in 21st and 23rd, you've got –
 interesting mix of businesses, but let's take just the service businesses, on 21st the guy that repairs shoes and does shoe shine, or let's go on 23rd and the place that my son dispatches me regularly to pick up a pizza is Escape from New York and places like that.
 Do we have the right mix of short-term parking that allows people to go in and do a quick transaction at some of those service businesses? Or what's your overall assessment? I think the balance is about right. One of the things we did most recently is look at the number of 30-minute spaces and how they're being used. Those are the short pickup spaces. And they were being way underused. Right.
 In other words, there was not as much demand as we were providing supply for, so we've cut back on that supply by about half to get that better in balance. The other place of balance now is there are some spaces that can be used only if you pay and other spaces that can be used if you pay or if you have a permit. The balance of those is probably off, and we're adjusting that as well. We're also doing some work at looking at loading zones and seeing if they're being used appropriately. So I think we've got the balance fairly close.
 But it's never going to be perfect, and will continue to be adjusted. Thank you. Good afternoon. Afternoon. Commissioner Fritz, I have a question. Well, I just wanted to comment, and thank you, Rick, that we had this on the agenda a month ago in December, and I couldn't help but remember December of 2012 when I...
 I think I still have emails that I should have responded to because of the volume of concern and the fact that you and the group have been able to get it so that it's basically moving forward and people may have suggestions and such and not be entirely happy with it. But what a difference, and thank you very much. I think it was one of the best decisions for Northwest Portland to implement this program. It hasn't been easy, but I think...
 I think it's well worth doing, and I think it's well worth the amount of energy the committee spends on it. As you see, we meet 18 times a year to make sure that everything is working right. So could you thank the whole committee from the council? We will. Thank you. We are all very grateful. Thank you. Thank you. Good afternoon again. My name is Tony Jordan. I represent Portlanders for Parking Reform.
 I think that this Northwest parking pilot is really important, and I think that the results show that better management of our parking supply can work to make parking more accessible and convenient. The results also show that I think a lot more can be done and needs to be done to truly make parking equitably accessible, convenient, and to ensure that parking management helps us meet our various goals. Some citizens are understandably frustrated that it's still hard to park and they still have to pay.
 And until we're charging a rate that supports an optimal occupancy, and that rate might change depending on the time of the day, the day of the week, the time of the day, or the day of the week or the time of the day, then there's a valid argument to be made that the city is charging more without solving the problem for people.
 So I think we should certainly aim to speed up the implementation of performance pricing and adjusting hours of enforcement so that the public right-of-way can be used to facilitate commerce and fellowship with a minimum of greenhouse gas emissions and traffic collisions.
 How we spend the revenue from parking is also very important, and I think that the Northwest Parking District is hitting the nail right on the head with the transportation wallet. It's a really innovative program. I promote it every chance I get. The surcharge revenue guidelines proposed are great because they're in line with that, and I strongly encourage you to approve them, and I think it will be good when they're implemented citywide. I do think that the
 One caveat would be that wherein we're using those revenues for shared parking, I do think it is important in the short term to try and provide additional capacity. But the long-term goals of the city are to reduce car trips. And so if you are adding capacity or opening up capacity, you are potentially increasing the amount of trips. So I think those should always be looked at with caution and with a good balance of how new supply balances with trying to just –
 convince people who can to take other modes. Sorry, my phone locked up. I'm happy to see that equity considerations are in the revenue allocation guidelines, but I also think we need to do more to bridge the gap of transportation subsidies we provide to low-income people with cars versus those we provide to people without them. It's understandable that we provide discounts to low-income drivers who buy permits. A $105 annual subsidy currently in Northwest is
 But why don't we provide free transportation wallets to low-income residents who don't buy a permit at all? So I do think that in a lot of these programs, we subsidize. And it's good. Make it easier for people with low incomes who need to drive for their job. But there are people who don't own a car, and there's no subsidy being provided to them. And that, I think, is an area that can be focused on.
 Done properly, parking management can be a win-win-win. We can meet climate goals. We can make it safer and more convenient to visit our commercial districts. And we can use the money in a redistributive manner to further shift modes and to provide economic assistance to the people who need it the most. So I think we should do it, and this is good stuff. Thank you, Mr. Jordan. Thank you, Mr. Jordan.
 What title would you give yourself in respect to the role you play in this issue? Because calling you a parking advocate sounds like you are advocating for parking. Parking reform advocacy. Parking reform advocate. Okay. And I just want to let you know that providing free transportation wallet would be an appropriate use of the surcharge, and it's something that my staff made sure was included in this.
 list because we are diligently working in my office and in PBOT to avoid further burdening low income residents. It's a top priority when we're talking about transportation is equity and access and inclusion.
 And finally, I'll just say, if Tony Jordan likes something we're doing, I'm doing something right, but I'm probably kicking off a bunch of other people. Maybe, maybe. My son says a lot of people in town don't like you. What?
 How old is your son? He's 12. Oh, yeah. I'm not 12. Of course. He's often one of them, yes. But, you know, I like to, when something comes up, comment on the internet, you know, we'll sometimes talk about it. And he knows that, you know, not everyone agrees with my opinion.
 what I think we should do. I appreciate your work and your support. And if I could add just one thing about the low-income transportation wallet, we would love to be able to provide those free for all the people who could get them. We don't have the revenue source.
 We can look at increasing the surcharge some more for subsidies, but it's too complicated for us to deal with. That's our first step. We need to make TriMet free for everybody, don't we? I think that centrally side would echo that. We're very interested in those kinds of conversations for sure.
 Very good. Thank you. Does that conclude invited testimony? That does conclude invited testimony. Sue, did we have a couple of folks signed up? No one else. Nobody else? Anybody here who wanted to testify, didn't get the opportunity? No takers? All right. Very good. Please call the roll. Fritz. Thank you very much to everybody who's been involved, Dave Benson, Matt Graham, Yesenia Carrillo, my staff, everyone.
 And as the Commissioner in Charge of the Office of Equity and Human Rights, I really appreciate the use of the Council's adopted citywide racial equity goals and strategies and the commitment to use that. You do have a fantastic equity manager in the Council.
 Portland Bureau of Transportation and I appreciate all of my colleagues having that front and centre of all of the concerns that we're looking at here and indeed the acknowledgement from Rick Michelson that there are some low income people who have to be able to drive to work. Either the bus doesn't go there at the right time or it just takes too long to get between jobs to make ends meet.
 So thank you for bringing that, and I greatly appreciate Commissioner Daly and your staff helping me figure this out as to what we're doing and why, and I'm very supportive now. Bye. Fish. Well, Commissioner Fritz.
 for the first time in the 10 years that I've served with her today, confessed that she was behind in responding to her e-mails. I know. Cut that, too. I don't believe it. But I think the point that she was making is that the easiest way to fill this chamber and to extend the clock on a hearing –
 was to either talk about transportation and parking in northwest Portland or a rate increase in our public utilities or some combination of the two. And we literally could pack the place on both issues. It took a long time for us to get both right.
 But on the transportation side, the fact that this is now no drama and instead we're talking about how to use these resources wisely and how to align them better with equity is a quantum leap from the conversation we used to have here, which was basically a huge level of skepticism about implementing any plan and then huge opposition to,
 And here we are. So to the SAC and to people like Rick Michelson who have been working on this issue for a long time, I want to echo what Commissioner Fritz said. We owe you an enormous debt of gratitude. There's a lot of issues that we currently deal with where, you know, two or three people show up and testify, where hundreds used to sign up, and we used to go into the evening, and there was genuine rancor. And...
 And it takes a lot of hard work to get to a point where there's this level of trust and where the system is working on balance pretty well. And as I've learned, it almost invariably requires the intervention of people outside of this building to get us to that point. It's the trust and credibility that the citizens who are engaged in these issues bring, which is really the secret sauce.
 So I couldn't be more pleased with the presentation. I want to thank Commissioner Udaly for bringing this forward. It was an outstanding presentation, and I couldn't be happier with the direction that we're headed. And the idea that offering this wallet of incentives as an inducement to not use a parking pass is really inspiring.
 And the fact that we actually see a trend line where we could be under capacity at some point is really encouraging. So congratulations to all. I'm very pleased to vote aye. Hardesty. I also want to appreciate the hard work that's gone into bringing this initiative forward. And certainly Northwest Portland has had parking problems the entire time I've lived here. And that's
 I'm coming up on my 30th year. And so the good news is the rest of Portland has an opportunity to learn from you and to learn from how community and government and businesses can work together and try to find the best solution possible. And so I am very grateful for the hard work that's been done. Thank you.
 I would be remiss if I didn't put on a record that I just want to make sure that we're using these resources to actually reduce the transit barriers for very low-income people and that we are very mindful that the range of incomes in Northwest and in other areas of our city are enormous.
 And so the more we can do to make public transit available for more people, the better we're going to be as a city. And so thank you all for your good work. Thank you, Commissioner Udaly and your staff for the work that you've done. And I vote aye. Udaly.
 Well, I just want to start by reiterating our commitment to coming up with innovative solutions to mitigate, reduce, eliminate barriers to low-income residents. We cannot be making it harder for low-income individuals to live and work in this city. And I'd also just like to add...
 to that list. It's something that I didn't have a chance to discuss, but I am concerned with how
 these plans may impact people with mobility challenges or other health issues that legitimately need to park or are more reliant on cars because we don't have the greatest accessible citywide public transit service and need to park closer to their homes. So that's
 Another little angle for us to get at. Thank you for the presentation, the testimony and discussion. As is clear, this is complex and challenging work, and it's great to know we have such dedicated volunteers and staff digging into the myriad issues that parking and permit programs produce.
 I'm especially gratified by the opportunity this gives us to be innovators in the country, as well as around the rest of the city, around parking privileges, and to highlight how to effectively use these privileges to directly benefit those without them. It's my hope that communities who opt to utilize this parking program will choose to spend that money to the greatest benefit for the most disadvantaged residents.
 Now I'd like to thank all the community partners and specifically the chairs of our advisory committees in Northwest and the Central East Side, which are Rick Michelson and Juliana Lukasik, respectively, who both spoke today, as well as Tony Jordan.
 Tony, I appreciate you acknowledging that we may, in the short term, need to increase the supply. But as I think you know by now, I am firmly committed to reducing the reliance on single occupant vehicles. But we need to be increasing public transit, bicycle, walking, other options alongside vehicles.
 I guess, making driving your own car less appealing. So thank you for your support in that area. I'd also like to thank staff, Chris Arms, Dave Benson, Scott Cohen, Antonina Padas, Colleen Mossler, and Catherine Doherty-Chapman from PBOT, as well as Rick Williams and Owen Ronkelly from Rick Williams Consulting.
 This is an important step in PBOT's efforts to actively and effectively manage parking in our close-in neighborhoods. I look forward to bringing more neighborhoods and innovative ideas to council in the months to come. I vote aye. Wheeler.
 First of all, I want to yield some time to Commissioner Fritz. Thank you, Mayor. One of the disadvantages of speaking first is that then everybody else reminds you of what you should have said, so I appreciate that. Because there's one extremely important person that needs to be recognized, and that is Mayor Sam Adams, because the Northwest Parking District would not have happened without Sam Adams in December of 2012. It was a very close vote and a lot of community concern and a lot of people who said this is totally not going to work in December.
 doom and disaster. So I do feel it's important to acknowledge Mayor Sam Adams. I think that's excellent and I assume that Sam watches each and every one of these. Sam, it's good to
 Good to hear from you. And thank you for that acknowledgment, understanding that there's a lot of history that goes into this. There was a very intentional effort here over a period of many years, and the community in particular came forward and really helped lead this, and we're seeing that again today. Commissioner Udailey, you continue the fine line of people who have helped steward these programs forward and continuing to innovate.
 and keep us on the cutting edge in making things work, balancing all of these competing and important values, making sure that people have accessibility, making sure that equity is in the equation, making sure that we have vibrant, economically successful businesses in our neighborhoods, making sure that we achieve our climate action goals, and acknowledging the hard, cold fact, which is that
 Assuming we maintain our preference to have an urban growth boundary and protect the wildlands outside of the urban growth boundary, that just means by necessity in the decades ahead we're going to continue to have more density inside the urban growth boundary, which means we have to find smarter transportation solutions.
 And I thought this was actually a very fun council session. I learned a lot today. And I always feel proud to be part of a city that has the community and government working together very effectively to help us be on the cutting edge of how to address these issues. And today is yet one more example. So thank you all for your great work, for your hard work. I vote aye. The ordinance is adopted as amended. And we're adjourned.
