And so these households have to go to many different websites or organizations to find out not only about the regulated units, their cost and their availability, but to actually submit an application, pay an application fee, and this happens multiple times. And so with the expansion, so looking forward as the city and you all as the city council have moved forward on increasing the tax exemption for rental units through the city's multi-program, as the city increasingly looks at getting affordable housing units through density bonuses in the central city, as well as the mixed-use zoning outside the central city, we anticipate an increase in the number of property management firms,  joining the regulated affordable housing industry.",affordable housing

Inclusionary housing policies reduce affordable housing by requiring new residential developments to include a certain percentage of affordable housing units, whereas if the legislature were to lift the preemption on inclusionary housing,  in the 2016 session, it would allow City Council to comprehensively consider the use of the tool, while it also considers its comprehensive plan, incentive zoning, and linkage fee proposal. Now, therefore, be it resolved, if the Oregon State Legislature lifts the statewide preemption on inclusionary housing ordinances, the City of Portland would consider the use of an inclusionary housing ordinance to create affordable housing  within new market rate residential developments and be it further resolved during the consideration of any inclusionary housing ordinance, the City of Portland would engage in a community-wide data-driven discussion that would include but would not be limited to members of the development community as well as affordable housing experts and advocates.",affordable housing
